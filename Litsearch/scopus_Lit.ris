AB  - Vector-borne pathogens (VBPs) of canines are a diverse range of infectious agents, including viruses, bacteria, protozoa and multicellular parasites, that are pernicious and potentially lethal to their hosts. Dogs across the globe are afflicted by canine VBPs, but the range of different ectoparasites and the VBPs that they transmit predominate in tropical regions. Countries within the Asia-Pacific have had limited prior research dedicated to exploring the epidemiology of canine VBPs, whilst the few studies that have been conducted show VBP prevalence to be high, with significant impacts on dog health. Moreover, such impacts are not restricted to dogs, as some canine VBPs are zoonotic. We reviewed the status of canine VBPs in the Asia-Pacific, with particular focus on nations in the tropics, whilst also investigating the history of VBP diagnosis and examining recent progress in the field, including advanced molecular methods, such as next-generation sequencing (NGS). These tools are rapidly changing the way parasites are detected and discovered, demonstrating a sensitivity equal to, or exceeding that of, conventional molecular diagnostics. We also provide a background to the armoury of chemopreventive products available for protecting dogs from VBP. Here, field-based research within high VBP pressure environments has underscored the importance of ectoparasiticide mode of action on their overall efficacy. The future of canine VBP diagnosis and prevention at a global level is also explored, highlighting how evolving portable sequencing technologies may permit diagnosis at point-of-care, whilst further research into chemopreventives will be essential if VBP transmission is to be effectively controlled. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease with high prevalence in low-income and middle-income countries and tropical and subtropical regions. The clinical symptoms of the disease are similar to symptoms presented by other endemic infectious diseases that could be present simultaneously. Thus, leptospirosis could be masked by similar infections like dengue, malaria, hantavirus, melioidosis and borreliosis, among others. Therefore, leptospirosis could present itself as an under-reported infection or as a coinfection with another pathogen, as has been reported in the literature. However, there is a lack of documented evidence about the specific risk factors of leptospirosis infection, the symptoms, the coinfection's mortality and the frequency of coinfection. Additionally, leptospirosis coinfections have not been considered a neglected public health concern. Therefore, this systematic review aims to evaluate published articles that show the risk factors associated with leptospirosis infection and coinfection with other pathogens. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The search process to identify eligible studies will be conducted including the LILACS, ProQuest, PubMed and Scopus databases with no restriction in terms of publication date. Also, grey literature will be included in the research. Authors will independently screen the title and abstracts of the articles identified from the search using Rayyan free software. Eligibility criteria include peer-reviewed research articles written in English or Spanish, including observational studies, cohorts, case-control, cross-sectional, ecological studies and report cases. The systematic review will include studies that report descriptions of leptospirosis cases with coinfection or co-occurrence. The search will be accomplished by articles from 1950 to May 2022. The data will be extracted in a standard extraction form using an Excel format. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Results will be published in a peer-reviewed journal. Also, findings will be disseminated through scientific meetings. Ethical approval will not be required as this is a systematic review and primary data will be not collected or included.

AB  - Infectious diseases are one of the main threats to biodiversity. The fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) is associated with several amphibian losses around the globe, and environmental conditions may dictate the success of pathogen spread. The Brazilian Amazon has been considered climatically unsuitable for chytrid fungus, but additional information on Bd dynamics in this ecoregion is still lacking. We sampled 462 amphibians (449 anurans, 4 caudatans and 9 caecilians), representing 57 species from the Brazilian Amazon, and quantified Bd infections using qPCR. We tested whether abiotic variables predicted the risk of Bd infections, and tested for relationships between biotic variables and Bd. Finally, we experimentally tested the effects of Bd strains CLFT 156 and CLFT 102 (from the southern and northern Atlantic Forest, respectively) on Atelopus manauensis. We detected higher Bd prevalence than those previously reported for the Brazilian Amazon, and positive individuals in all 3 orders of amphibians sampled. Both biotic and abiotic predictors were related to prevalence, and no variable explained infection load. Moreover, we detected higher Bd prevalence in forested than open areas, while the host's reproductive biology was not a factor. We detected higher mortality in the experimental group infected with CLFT 156, probably because this strain was isolated from a region characterized by discrepant climatic conditions (latitudinally more distant) when compared with the host's sampling site in Amazon. The lowland Brazilian Amazon is still underexplored and future studies targeting all amphibian orders are essential to better understand Bd infection dynamics in this region.

AB  - This review paper discusses the Stockholm Paradigm (SP) as a theoretical framework and practical computational instrument for studying and assessing the risk of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) as a result of climate change. The SP resolves the long-standing parasite paradox and explains how carbon emissions in the atmosphere increase parasites’ generalization and intensify host switches from animals to humans. The SP argues that the growing rate of novel EID occurrence caused by mutated zoonotic pathogens is related to the following factors brought together as a unified issue of humanity: (a) carbon emissions and consequent climate change; (b) resettlement/migration of people with hyper-urbanization; (c) overpopulation; and (d) human-induced distortion of the biosphere. The SP demonstrates that, in an evolutionary way, humans now play a role migratory birds once played in spreading parasite pathogens between the three Earth megabiotopes (northern coniferous forest belt; tropical/equatorial rainforest areas; and hot/cold deserts), i.e., the role of “super-spreaders” of parasitic viruses, bacteria, fungi and protozoa. This makes humans extremely vulnerable to the EID threat. The SP sees the +1.0–+1.2 °C limit as the optimal target for the slow, yet feasible curbing of the EID hazard to public health (150–200 years). Reaching merely the +2.0 °C level will obviously be an EID catastrophe, as it may cause two or three pandemics each year. We think it useful and advisable to include the SP-based research in the scientific repository of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, since EID appearance and spread are indirect but extremely dangerous consequences of climate change. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Burkholderia pseudomallei is the causative agent of melioidosis, a serious infectious disease in humans and animals that may be asymptomatic long-term and quickly develop to pneumonia and septicemia in immunocompromised state and due to predisposing factors. Melioidosis is endemic in countries with tropical and subtropical climates, where B. pseudomallei is a part of the soil and water microbiota of stagnant water bodies, as well as the plant rhizosphere. The recording of imported melioidosis cases in countries with temperate climate zone, along with the continued threat of using this pathogen as a bioterrorism agent, indicate the relevance of research aimed at developing modern methods for its diagnosing and typing. Current research in the intraspecific differentiation of pathogenic strains of infectious diseases tends to use two or more types of molecular markers. A promising direction for the B. pseudomallei strains genotyping is based on using a combination of VNTR loci, which provides a high discriminating ability of the method of multi-locus variable tandem repeat number analysis (MLVA), and slowly evolving single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The aim of this work was to identify new VNTR and SNP loci suitable for use as genetic markers in molecular typing of the melioidosis causative agent. 20 strains of B. pseudomallei from the collection of the Volgograd Plague Control Research Institute and whole genome sequences of 85 B. pseudomallei strains from the GenBank NCBI database were analyzed. While typing melioidosis causative agent strains from the GenBank NCBI database for 4 VNTR loci, 74 genotypes were identified, of which 64 were unique (Hunter–Gaston index 0.997). It was found that the high allelic polymorphism of VNTR loci limited a potential to determine the geographical and phylogenetic relationships of B. pseudomallei isolates by using the MLVA-4 scheme, and the identified null alleles increased the risk of homoplasia. In this regard, the MLVA-4 scheme was supplemented with a VNTR marker in the BPSS1974 locus encoding a collagen-like protein as well as with SNP markers in the genes of lipid A biosynthesis lauroyl acyltransferase, RNA polymerase sigma factor RpoH, and glutamine amidotransferase. For amplification of the select loci, primers and probes were designed as part of the developed scheme, which were tested in the typing of B. pseudomallei collection strains. According to the results of a cluster analysis for 105 strains of the melioidosis causative agent, an integrated approach turned out to be optimal, allowing differentiation of strains within SNP groups based on VNTR profiles. The methodological approach developed for B. pseudomallei genetic typing, based on a comprehensive analysis of 4 SNP- and 5 MLVA-markers in our modification, allowed to differentiate strains according to the geographical regions of their origin and establish the clonal origin of isolates upon revealing cases of melioidosis. © 2022 Saint Petersburg Pasteur Institute.

AB  - Accurate prediction of zoonotic spillover events requires a detailed understanding of baseline pathogens circulating in differing global environments. By characterizing the diversity and determining the natural baseline of pathogens in a given biological system, any perturbations to this balance can be detected, leading to estimates of risk for emerging diseases. As epidemics and probability for pandemics increase, there is a fundamental need for building global collaborations to fill gaps in the surveillance effort, especially to build remote in-county capacity and standardize timely sample processing and data analysis. To this point, a new consortium, the Remote Emerging Disease Intelligence-NETwork (REDI-NET) has been established to enhance surveillance approaches and characterize natural pathogens in temperate, tropical forest, and tropical grassland biomes. The REDI-NET is envisioned to be a long-term, phased initiative. All phases will integrate accompanying training resources such as videos reflecting SOPs and Quick Reference Guides. Routine bio- and xenosurveillance will facilitate the characterization of ecological parameters, enhance the accuracy of vector species identification using artificial intelligence technology, and guide the establishment of epidemiological risk thresholds critical for mitigating disease outbreaks in a timely manner. A key deliverable of the REDI-NET is a custom-designed electronically merged (e-MERGE) data pipeline and alert dashboard that integrates remotely captured data with state-of-the-art metagenomic next-generation sequencing technology. This pipeline incorporates data generated from field and laboratory best practices, to furnish health decision-makers with a centralized, timely, and rigorous database to efficiently search interdisciplinary and heterogeneous data sources necessary to alert, prepare and mitigate health threats. The e-MERGE pipeline, once fully established, will be a flexible, scalable, and expandable tool for varied health applications. Program success will result in an operational framework that addresses resource gaps in pathogen surveillance and enhances health protection with broad global applicability. The objective of this manuscript is to introduce the REDI-NET framework to anticipated stakeholders engaged in metagenomics, epidemiological surveillance, and One Health with a focus on Phase 1.

AB  - Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne infectious disease which is transmitted through Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. It is one of the major global health issues in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Its dynamics are very complicated owing to the coupling among multiple transmission pathways and various components in pathogen. Due to absence of proper medicine or vaccination, mathematical modeling plays an important role in understanding the disease dynamics and in designing strategies to control the spread of dengue virus. In this paper, we studied a non-linear vector-host model to investigate the transmission dynamics of dengue virus which can be controlled by vaccination as well as treatment. Analysis of model start with the basic reproduction number R0, when it is less than one, the system become locally asymptotically stable about the virus-free equilibrium point. We calibrated our proposed model corresponding to transmission of dengue virus using real data for six Indian states, namely Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Delhi, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Karnataka by using the least square method. Moreover, we performed normalized forward sensitivity analysis of the basic reproduction number and obtained that mitigating the disease transmission rate of mosquito and human population is the most important factor in achieving dengue control. Finally, an objective functional has been developed to minimize the cost of the vaccination and solved with the aid of the Pontryagin's Maximum Principle. The implementation of the optimal treatment policy shows a significant reduction of the hospitalized individuals as well as infected individuals. We then performed extensive numerical simulations to validate our theoretical analysis with aid of the estimated model parameters. © 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The Old World tropical and subtropical frugivorous bat genus Rousettus (Pteropodidae) contains species with broad distributions, as well as those occurring in restricted geographical areas, particularly islands. Herein we review the role of Rousettus as a keystone species from a global “One Health” approach and related to ecosystem functioning, zoonotic disease and public health. Rousettus are efficient at dispersing seeds and pollinating flowers; their role in forest regeneration is related to their ability to fly considerable distances during nightly foraging bouts and their relatively small body size, which allows them to access fruits in forested areas with closed vegetation. Rousettus are also reservoirs for various groups of pathogens (viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoa), which, by definition, are infectious agents causing disease. The study of day roosts of different species of Rousettus and the successful establishment of captive breeding colonies have provided important details related to the infection dynamics of their associated pathogens. Large-scale conversion of forested areas into agricultural landscapes has increased contact between humans and Rousettus, therefore augmenting the chances of infectious agent spillover. Many crucial scientific details are still lacking related to members of this genus, which have direct bearing on the prevention of emerging disease outbreaks, as well as the conservation of these bats. The public should be better informed on the capacity of fruit bats as keystone species for large scale forest regeneration and in spreading pathogens. Precise details on the transmission of zoonotic diseases of public health importance associated with Rousettus should be given high priority. © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - Background: Precipitation variability is a potentially important driver of infectious diseases that are leading causes of child morbidity and mortality worldwide. Disentangling the links between precipitation variability and disease risk is crucial in a changing climate. We aimed to investigate the links between precipitation variability and reported symptoms of infectious disease (cough, fever, and diarrhoea) in children younger than 5 years. Methods: We used nationally representative survey data collected between 2014 and 2019 from Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) surveys for 32 low-income to middle-income countries in combination with high-resolution precipitation data (via the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station dataset). We only included DHS data for which interview dates and GPS coordinates (latitude and longitude) of household clusters were available. We used a regression modelling approach to assess the relationship between different precipitation variability measures and infectious disease symptoms (cough, fever, and diarrhoea), and explored the effect modification of different climate zones and disease susceptibility factors. Findings: Our global analysis showed that anomalously wet conditions increase the risk of cough, fever, and diarrhoea symptoms in humid, subtropical regions. These health risks also increased in tropical savanna regions as a result of anomalously dry conditions. Our analysis of susceptibility factors suggests that unimproved sanitation and unsafe drinking water sources are exacerbating these effects, particularly for rural populations and in drought-prone areas in tropical savanna. Interpretation: Weather shifts can affect the survival and transmission of pathogens that are particularly harmful to young children. As our findings show, the health burden of climate-sensitive infectious diseases can be substantial and is likely to fall on populations that are already among the most disadvantaged, including households living in remote rural areas and those lacking access to safe water and sanitation infrastructure.

AB  - Neurological disorders related to neuroinfections are highly prevalent in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), constituting a major cause of disability and economic burden for patients and society. These include epilepsy, dementia, motor neuron diseases, headache disorders, sleep disorders, and peripheral neuropathy. The highest prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is in SSA. Consequently, there is a high prevalence of neurological disorders associated with HIV infection such as HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders, motor disorders, chronic headaches, and peripheral neuropathy in the region. The pathogenesis of these neurological disorders involves the direct role of the virus, some antiretroviral treatments, and the dysregulated immune system. Furthermore, the high prevalence of epilepsy in SSA (mainly due to perinatal causes) is exacerbated by infections such as toxoplasmosis, neurocysticercosis, onchocerciasis, malaria, bacterial meningitis, tuberculosis, and the immune reactions they elicit. Sleep disorders are another common problem in the region and have been associated with infectious diseases such as human African trypanosomiasis and HIV and involve the activation of the immune system. While most headache disorders are due to benign primary headaches, some secondary headaches are caused by infections (meningitis, encephalitis, brain abscess). HIV and neurosyphilis, both common in SSA, can trigger long-standing immune activation in the central nervous system (CNS) potentially resulting in dementia. Despite the progress achieved in preventing diseases from the poliovirus and retroviruses, these microbes may cause motor neuron diseases in SSA. The immune mechanisms involved in these neurological disorders include increased cytokine levels, immune cells infiltration into the CNS, and autoantibodies. This review focuses on the major neurological disorders relevant to Africa and neuroinfections highly prevalent in SSA, describes the interplay between neuroinfections, immune system, neuroinflammation, and neurological disorders, and how understanding this can be exploited for the development of novel diagnostics and therapeutics for improved patient care.

AB  - Eumycetoma is a chronic debilitating fungal disease endemic to tropical and subtropical regions, with Sudan featuring the highest eumycetoma incidence. Among the 50 species of fungi most commonly associated with eumycetoma Madurella mycetomatis (M. mycetoma-tis) is often referenced as the most common pathogen. However, there is an enormous knowledge gap related to this neglected disease and its pathogenesis, epidemiological fea-tures, and host-specific factors that could contribute to either the host susceptibility and resistance. In this study, we were able to utilize a metagenomic approach and samples col-lected from clinical black grains (BG) and familiar household environments aimed to assay both the habitat of eumycetoma-associated fungi and its possible connection with eumyce-toma patients living in two different eumycetoma endemic villages within the White Nile State of Sudan. DNA sequencing targeting the fungal ITS2 domain was performed on soil, animal dung, housing walls and roofs, and Acacia-species thorn samples and compared with culture-dependent methods of fungal isolation. Additionally, we compared the soil samples obtained in the endemic zone with that from non-endemic zones, including Wagga village in Kassala State and Port Sudan suburb in Port Sudan State. Overall, a total of 392 Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs) were detected by ITS2 metagenomics Eumycetoma causative organisms accounted for 10% of total ASVs which included 11 genera: Exserohi-lum (2%), Aspergillus (1.7%), Curvularia (1%), Alternaria (0.9%), Madurella (0.5%), Fusar-ium (0.4%), Cladosporium (0.2%) Exophiala (0.15%), and, in a lesser extent, Microascus (0.05%) Bipolaris and Acremonium (0.01%) for each. Only five genera were identified by culture method, which included Fusarium (29%), Aspergillus (28%), Alternaria (2.5%), Bipo-laris (1.6%), and Chaetomium (0.8%). M. mycetomatis was detected within all the studied patients’ houses, accounting for 0.7% of total sequences. It was the first common eumyce-toma-associated agent detected in soil samples and the third common in the dung and wall samples. In contrast, it was not detected in the roof or thorn samples nor in the soils from non-endemic regions. Exserohilum rostratum, Aspergillus spp and Cladosporium spp were detected in all samples. M. mycetomatis and other eumycetoma-associated fungal identified in the patients’ black grains (BG) samples by metagenomics were identified in the environmental samples. Only Acremonium alternatum and Falciformispora senegalensis, responsible for eumycetoma in two patients were not detected, suggesting the infections in these patients happened outside these endemic areas. The soil, animal dung, and houses built from the same soil and dung are the main risk factors for M. mycetomatis infection in these endemic villages. Furthermore, the poor hygienic and environmental conditions, walking barefooted, and the presence of animals within the houses increase the risk of M. myceto-matis and other fungi causing eumycetoma. © 2022 Santona et al.

AB  - Introduction: Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) in developing countries like the Caribbean, negatively affect multiple income-generating sectors, including the tourism industry upon which island states are highly dependent. Insect-transmitted NTDs include, but are not limited to, malaria, dengue and lymphatic filariasis. Control measures for these disease, are often ignored because of the associated cost. Many of the developing country members are thus retained in a financially crippling cycle, balancing the cost of prophylactic measures with that of controlling an outbreak. The purpose of the paper is to bring awareness to NTDs transmitted by insects of importance to humans, and to assess factors affecting such control, in the English-speaking Caribbean. Method: Comprehensive literature review on reports pertaining to NTDs transmitted by insects in the Caribbean and Latin America was conducted. Data search was carried out on PubMed, and WHO and PAHO websites. Results and conclusion: Potential risk factors for NTDs transmitted by arthropods in the English-speaking Caribbean are summarised. The mosquito appears to be the main insect-vector of human importance within the region of concern. Arthropod-vectors of diseases of veterinary importance are also relevant because they affect the livelihood of farmers, in highly agriculture based economies. Other NTDs may also be in circulation gauged by the presence of antibodies in Caribbean individuals. However, routine diagnostic tests for specific diseases are expensive and tests may not be conducted when diseases are not prevalent in the population. It appears that only a few English-speaking Caribbean countries have examined secondary reservoirs of pathogens or assessed the effectivity of their insect control methods. As such, disease risk assessment appears incomplete. Although continuous control is financially demanding, an integrated and multisectoral approach might help to deflect the cost. Such interventions are now being promoted by health agencies within the region and various countries are creating and exploring the use of novel tools to be incorporated in their insect-vector control programmes. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - High incidences of waterborne diseases occur due to consumption of contaminated surface water sources globally. Monitoring and health risk assessment is required to understand whether the surface water is appropriate for irrigation, recreational and domestic use. It is vital to identify the reasons that influence the dynamic dispersal of waterborne pathogens and faecal indicator bacteria (FIB). The projected increase in precipitation and higher temperatures due to climate change are likely to exacerbate the problems of faecal contamination. This could be further compounded by the rapid change in socio-economic conditions in developing countries. Therefore, improved understanding of the influence of climate change and socio-economic development on microbial water quality is very important to reduce future health risks. Even with the high relevance for public health, few studies currently exist on the fate and transport of pathogens/FIB in tropical regions, and only a few studies have quantified the relationship between the pathogens/FIB concentrations and climate and socio-economic changes globally. Furthermore, most studies have been based on FIB. Other detrimental pathogens (e.g. infectious bacteria, viruses, and protozoa) have not been included in most of the studies due to difficulties associated with detecting these pathogens in the environment. There are differences between temperate and tropical ecosystems and due to such differences waterborne pathogens may behave differently in the two systems. In this article, besides reviewing existing literature on microbial monitoring, modelling, health risk assessment and future scenario analysis, we focus on the differences in microbial behaviour between temperate and tropical ecosystems. We also highlight some of the key present-day gaps and reflect on possible future guidelines for research in this domain. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Canine vector-borne diseases (CVBDs) are highly prevalent in tropical and subtropical countries, mainly due to favorable climate conditions and reduced adoption of preventive measures. This study aimed to provide a comprehensive overview on the prevalence of CVBDs in Iran and Pakistan where limited data are available. Blood samples were collected from 403 dogs from six provinces in Iran and Pakistan to assess the presence of pathogen DNA (i.e., Anaplasma spp., Coxiella burnetii, Ehrlichia spp., Rickettsia spp., Babesia spp., Hepatozoon spp., filarioids, and Leishmania spp.). Sera were also screened by an immunofluorescence antibody test for the detection of antibodies against Leishmania infantum. In total, 46.9% of dogs scored positive to Hepatozoon canis being the most frequently detected (41.4%), followed by Anaplasma platys (6.4%), Ehrlichia canis (3.4%), Rickettsia spp. (2.2%), Babesia vogeli (1.0%), and L. infantum (0.3%). A seroprevalence of 9.6% to anti-L. infantum IgG was also recorded. Data reported herein demonstrate that dogs from Iran and Pakistan are at a high risk of CVBDs, particularly of canine hepatozoonosis. Effective control strategies are advocated for minimizing the risk of infection in animals and humans, also in consideration of the zoonotic potential of some pathogens detected. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Infectious diseases represent, as a group, the main cause of mortality in the world. The most important reasons are multidrug-resistant pathogens, the rapid spread of emerging diseases aggravated by globalization, and the extended reach of tropical and vector-borne diseases resulting from continued climate change. Given the increase in these diseases and the limited effectiveness of antibiotics, traditional knowledge can constitute a useful tool to address these new health challenges. The aim of this work is to analyze extensively the available ethnobotanical data linked to infections and infestations in the Catalan linguistic area, with the intention of depicting the panorama of the folk use of herbal products to address the quoted ailments, preserving the popular plant knowledge and management data. The meta-analytic work performed in the present study covers 29 research studies belonging to different regions throughout the Catalan linguistic area. The medicinal ethnoflora to treat infections and infestations in the Catalan linguistic area includes 326 taxa belonging to 78 botanical families of vascular plants. The informant consensus factor (FIC) was 0.92, and the ethnobotanicity index (EI) was 7.26%. Artemisia absinthium (10.98%; 0.37) and Thymus vulgaris (8.06%; 0.27) are the most quoted taxa and have the highest values of the cultural importance index. The most reported use was antihelminthic (30.15%), followed by internal antiseptic (19.43%) and antipyretic (13.69%). The medicinal importance index shows the relevance of the antihelminthic use (14.23) and also the use against measles (10.19). The information is coincidental with at least one of the comprehensive pharmacological literature sources checked for 47.42% of ethnobotanical uses. These results, centered on the plants used to treat infection and infestation diseases, are the first step toward selecting some of the most interesting species to develop phytochemical and pharmacological studies and suggesting an alternative regarding how to face the health emergency involving the expansion of infectious diseases, based on local and traditional knowledge. © Copyright © 2021 Gras, Parada, Vallès and Garnatje.

AB  - Some of the climate-sensitive infections (CSIs) affecting humans are zoonotic vector-borne diseases, such as Lyme borreliosis (BOR) and tick-borne encephalitis (TBE), mostly linked to various species of ticks as vectors. Due to climate change, the geographical distribution of tick species, their hosts, and the prevalence of pathogens are likely to change. A recent increase in human incidences of these CSIs in the Nordic regions might indicate an expansion of the range of ticks and hosts, with vegetation changes acting as potential predictors linked to habitat suitability. In this paper, we study districts in Fennoscandia and Russia where incidences of BOR and TBE have steadily increased over the 1995–2015 period (defined as ’Well Increasing districts’). This selection is taken as a proxy for increasing the prevalence of tick-borne pathogens due to increased habitat suitability for ticks and hosts, thus simplifying the multiple factors that explain incidence variations. This approach allows vegetation types and strengths of correlation specific to the WI districts to be differentiated and compared with associations found over all districts. Land cover types and their changes found to be associated with increasing human disease incidence are described, indicating zones with potential future higher risk of these diseases. Combining vegetation cover and climate variables in regression models shows the interplay of biotic and abiotic factors linked to CSI incidences and identifies some differences between BOR and TBE. Regression model projections up until 2070 under different climate scenarios depict possible CSI progressions within the studied area and are consistent with the observed changes over the past 20 years. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Cholera is a water-borne infectious disease that affects 1.3 to 4 million people, with 21,000 to 143,000 reported fatalities each year worldwide. Outbreaks are devastating to affected communities and their prospects for development. The key to support preparedness and public health response is the ability to forecast cholera outbreaks with sufficient lead time. How Vibrio cholerae survives in the environment outside a human host is an important route of disease transmission (see a review of Racault et al. 2019). Thus, identifying the environmental and climate drivers of these pathogens is highly desirable. Here, we elucidate for the first time a mechanistic link between climate variability and cholera (Satellite Water Marker; SWM) index in the Bengal Delta, which allows us to predict cholera outbreaks up to two seasons earlier. High values of the SWM index in fall were associated with above-normal summer monsoon rainfalls over northern India. In turn, these correlated with the La Niña climate pattern that was traced back to the summer monsoon and previous spring seasons. We present a new multi-linear regression model that can explain 50% of the SWM variability over the Bengal Delta based on the relationship with climatic indices of the El Niño Southern Oscillation, Indian Ocean Dipole, and summer monsoon rainfall during the decades 1997–2016. Interestingly, we further found that these relationships were non-stationary over the multi-decadal period 1948–2018. These results bear novel implications for developing outbreak-risk forecasts, demonstrating a crucial need to account for multi-decadal variations in climate interactions and underscoring to better understand how the south Asian summer monsoon responds to climate variability. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Ticks are highly specific obligate haematophagous ectoparasites of mammals, birds and reptiles, distributed globally and are of enormous medical and veterinary relevance owing to the direct damage they cause to their hosts. Moreover, they act as vectors of a large variety of human and animal pathogens. Today, most emerging infectious diseases arise from zoonotic pathogens, and many of them are transmitted by tick vectors. The cattle tick, Rhipicephalus microplus is one of the most damaging tick attacking bovines in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. In this book chapter, we would like to depict the prevalence of ticks in the western India and the factors responsible for their predominance in this region. The tick control programme is focused mainly on repeated use of organophosphates, pyrethroids, formamidines, phenylpyrazoles and macrocyclic lactones. However, the application of the acaricides is poorly supervised, resulting in economic problems produced by phenomenon such as acaricide resistance. Single host life cycle with short life cycle and high fecundity, the R. microplus has been subjected to maximum exposure of acaricides and thus developed a significant ability to become resistant to the toxic effect of the chemicals used to manage them. Control strategies against ticks rely mainly on judicious use of acaricides. Non-chemical natural product-based tick management protocol has also shown significant success in recent years. The indigenous ethno-veterinary and remedial knowledge of Indian farmers propose a range of herbs having insecticidal and acaricidal properties. The integrated approaches including pasture management with limited applications of effective chemical acaricides, strategic use of phytoformulation, housing management, strengthening of dairy cattle management with alternative feeding technologies and immunization against ticks and ticks borne diseases may be the most viable option for management of acaricide failure. Integrated tick management will certainly reduce the over reliance on acaricides and lessen selection pressure on ticks thereby preserving the chemicals. The availability of different control measures against ticks, their advantages and disadvantages, and their economic impact will be discussed in this chapter with the hope that the coordinated activities will significantly improve the health status of animals and the environment by minimizing the use of non-effective acaricides which will reduce the economic burden to the farmers. © 2021 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - Rural communities in Malaysia have been shown to be exposed to Coxiella, Borrelia and rickettsial infections in previous seroprevalence studies. Further research is necessary to identify the actual causative agents and the potential vectors of these infections. The arthropods parasitizing peri-domestic animals in these communities may serve as the vector in transmitting arthropod-borne and zoonotic agents to the humans. Molecular screening of bacterial and zoonotic pathogens from ticks and fleas collected from dogs, cats and chickens from six rural communities in Malaysia was undertaken. These communities were made up of mainly the indigenous people of Malaysia, known as the Orang Asli, as well as settlers in oil palm plantations. The presence of Coxiella burnetii, Borrelia, and rickettsial agents, including Rickettsia and Anaplasma, was investigated by performing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing. Candidatus Rickettsia senegalensis was detected in one out of eight pools of Ctenocephalides felis fleas. A relapsing fever group Borrelia sp. was identified from one of seven Haemaphysalis hystricis ticks tested. The results from the PCR screening for Anaplasma unexpectedly revealed the presence of Candidatus Midichloria sp., a potential tick endosymbiont, in two out of fourteen Haemaphysalis wellingtoni ticks tested. C. burnetii was not detected in any of the samples tested. The findings here provide evidence for the presence of potentially novel strains of rickettsial and borrelial agents in which their impact on public health risks among the rural communities in Malaysia merit further investigation. The detection of a potential endosymbiont of ticks also suggest that the presence of tick endosymbionts in the region is not fully explored. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The COVID-19 virus is a zoonotic disease, an infectious disease caused by a pathogen (an infectious agent, such as a bacterium, virus, parasite or prion) that has jumped from an animal (usually a vertebrate) to a human. It was declared a pandemic by World Health Organization (WHO) on January 30, 2020. The COVID-19 virus is also a zooanthroponosis, that can be transmitted from human to animals. Malaysia has seven wild cats' species and five mustelids which can be found in the forests of Peninsular Malaysia as well as in captivity, in zoos and conservation facilities. Human beings have the potential to spread the COVID-19 virus to wild mustelids and big cat species, which may threaten its populations in Peninsular Malaysia. The authorities must respond swiftly during the zoonotic phase and post-zoonotic contingency phase, with stringent policies and guidelines to control the spread of the disease into natural forest habitats that may threaten the mustelids and cat populations. © 2021 Penerbit UMT.

AB  - Bushmeat is not only an important source of fat, micronutrients, and macronutrients, but it also has medicinal uses. Extensive human-wildlife interactions may lead to pathogen exchange and trigger zoonotic infectious disease outbreaks such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, Ebola, and coronavirus disease 2019. In the tropics, bushmeat has become one of the most threatened resources due to widespread habitat loss and overexploitation, largely driven by increased global demand, weak governance, and lack of enforcement. Unsustainable harvesting, consumption, and production practices are common, although drivers are complex and intertwined and vary regionally, pointing to a looming rural nutrition security and wildlife conservation issue. Growing demand in fast urbanizing markets coupled with easy access fuels the illegal trade of bushmeat, medicinal products, and wildlife-based luxury goods. Although bushmeat contributes significantly to rural people's income and poverty alleviation, overharvesting impacts those who are most dependent on the forest. To balance the rural and cultural importance of bushmeat with conservation and public health priorities, strategies to safeguard tropical biodiversity, sustainable harvest of wildlife with reduced health risk for nutrition and medicine are urgently needed. © 2020 Annual Reviews Inc..

AB  - Pathogens originating from wildlife (zoonoses) pose a significant public health burden, com-prising the majority of emerging infectious diseases. Efforts to control and prevent zoonotic disease have traditionally focused on animal-to-human transmission, or “spillover.” How-ever, in the modern era, increasing international mobility and commerce facilitate the spread of infected humans, nonhuman animals (hereafter animals), and their products worldwide, thereby increasing the risk that zoonoses will be introduced to new geographic areas. Imported zoonoses can potentially “spill back” to infect local wildlife—a danger magnified by urbanization and other anthropogenic pressures that increase contacts between human and wildlife populations. In this way, humans can function as vectors, dispersing zoonoses from their ancestral enzootic systems to establish reservoirs elsewhere in novel animal host pop-ulations. Once established, these enzootic cycles are largely unassailable by standard control measures and have the potential to feed human epidemics. Understanding when and why translocated zoonoses establish novel enzootic cycles requires disentangling ecolog-ically complex and stochastic interactions between the zoonosis, the human population, and the natural ecosystem. In this Review, we address this challenge by delineating potential ecological mechanisms affecting each stage of enzootic establishment—wildlife exposure, enzootic infection, and persistence—applying existing ecological concepts from epidemiol-ogy, invasion biology, and population ecology. We ground our discussion in the neotropics, where four arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) of zoonotic origin—yellow fever, dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses—have separately been introduced into the human popula-tion. This paper is a step towards developing a framework for predicting and preventing novel enzootic cycles in the face of zoonotic translocations. © 2020 Guth et al.

AB  - Globally, there are a number of emerging pathogens. For most, there are no licensed vaccines available for human use, although there is ongoing research and development. However, given the extensive and increasing list of emerging pathogens and the investment required to bring vaccines into clinical use, the task is huge. Overlaid on this task is the risk of anti-microbial resistance (AMR) acquisition by micro-organisms which can endow a relatively harmless organism with pathogenic potential. Furthermore, climate change also introduces a challenge by causing some of the insect vectors and environmental conditions prevalent in tropical regions to begin to spread out from these traditional areas, thus increasing the risk of migration of zoonotic disease. Vaccination provides a defence against these emerging pathogens. However, vaccines for pathogens which cause severe, but occasional, disease outbreaks in endemic pockets have suffered from a lack of commercial incentive for development to a clinical standard, encompassing Phase III clinical trials for efficacy. An alternative is to develop such vaccines to request US Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), or equivalent status in the United States, Canada and the European Union, making use of a considerable number of regulatory mechanisms that are available prior to licensing. This review covers the status of vaccine development for some of the emerging pathogens, the hurdles that need to be overcome to achieve EUA or an equivalent regional or national status and how these considerations may impact vaccine development for the future, such that a more comprehensive stockpile of promising vaccines can be achieved. © 2019 Crown copyright.

AB  - Tropical forests have the greatest biodiversity in macroorganisms on the planet, and they are also the richest in myriads of microorganisms for which so little is known today. Over the last 50 years, many of these microbial forms, that are naturally embedded into wildlife or the environment, e.g. soil, water, have revealed to be more or less dangerous pathogens for people exposed to these new natural threats, i.e. emerging infectious diseases. Here, we discuss about the extraordinary diversity of microorganisms that are present in tropical rainforests. We first present the main global distribution patterns for microbial forms at the interface between tropical wildlife and human, and second we provide an epidemiological picture on how microbial transmission from wild animals or the environment to people operates in tropical areas through four case-studies. We examine the animal hosts or environment, and transmission mechanisms involved in spillover of zoonotic or environmentally-persistent microbes, and identify land-use changes through deforestation for the development of agriculture, and contacts with wildlife notably through bush meat hunting as major drivers that facilitate mixing of diverse animal hosts and their microbial communities with human during practices. With an increase of deforestation in the tropics and more contacts between wildlife and people, new emerging disease events with high epidemic and pandemic potential will happen, that should guide new health policies and strategies at the global scale. © S.F.S.P..

Les forêts intertropicales constituent une source exceptionnelle de diversité biologique spécifique en macroorganismes, mais elles se révèlent être aussi de véritables pépinières en microorganismes. Ces 50 dernières années, certains de ces microorganismes, à l’origine présents chez des animaux forestiers ou hébergés dans l’environnement comme le sol ou l’eau, se sont dévoilés être des agents pathogènes plus ou moins sévères pour les populations humaines exposées. Dans cet article, nous discutons des interactions hôtes-microorganismes rencontrées dans les forêts primaires en les abordant tant d’un angle macroécologique que d’un point de vue plus fonctionnel, en l’illustrant de quatre exemples d’agents microbiens émergents. Plus que tout autre déterminant, les modifications d’usages des sols, notamment au travers de la déforestation pour le développement d’une agriculture, et les contacts avec les microorganismes via la biodiversité, particulièrement lors de la pratique de chasse, exposent des individus susceptibles à ces nouveaux dangers microbiens. Avec la déforestation et des expositions croissantes avec la faune sauvage, le risque de nouvelles infections humaines devient une réalité internationale exigeant de la part des autorités publiques de mieux prendre en considération ces éléments pour la sécurité sanitaire mondiale. © S.F.S.P..

AB  - Climate change is one of the greatest threats to human health in the 21st century. Climate directly impacts health through climatic extremes, air quality, sea-level rise, and multifaceted influences on food production systems and water resources. Climate also affects infectious diseases, which have played a significant role in human history, impacting the rise and fall of civilizations and facilitating the conquest of new territories. Our review highlights significant regional changes in vector and pathogen distribution reported in temperate, peri-Arctic, Arctic, and tropical highland regions during recent decades, changes that have been anticipated by scientists worldwide. Further future changes are likely if we fail to mitigate and adapt to climate change. Many key factors affect the spread and severity of human diseases, including mobility of people, animals, and goods; control measures in place; availability of effective drugs; quality of public health services; human behavior; and political stability and conflicts. With drug and insecticide resistance on the rise, significant funding and research efforts must to be maintained to continue the battle against existing and emerging diseases, particularly those that are vector borne. © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - Emerging infectious diseases of zoonotic origin constitute a recurrent threat to global health. Nonhuman primates (NHPs) occupy an important place in zoonotic spillovers (pathogenic transmissions from animals to humans), serving as reservoirs or amplifiers of multiple neglected tropical diseases, including viral hemorrhagic fevers and arboviruses, parasites and bacteria, as well as retroviruses (simian foamy virus, PTLV) that are pathogenic in human beings. Hunting and butchering studies in Africa characterize at-risk human social groups, but overlook critical factors of contact heterogeneity and frequency, NHP species differences, and meat processing practices. In southeastern Cameroon, a region with a history of zoonotic emergence and high risk of future spillovers, we conducted a novel mixed-method field study of human physical exposure to multiple NHP species, incorporating participant-based and ecological methodologies, and qualitative interviews (n = 25). We find frequent physical contact across adult human populations, greater physical contact with monkeys than apes, especially for meat handling practices, and positive correlation of human exposure with NHP species abundance and proximity to human settlement. These fine-grained results encourage reconsideration of the likely dynamics of human-NHP contact in past and future NTD emergence events. Multidisciplinary social science and ecological approaches should be mobilized to generate more effective human and animal surveillance and risk communications around neglected tropical diseases. At a moment when the WHO has included “Disease X”, a presumably zoonotic pathogen with pandemic potential, on its list of blueprint priority diseases as, new field-based tools for investigating zoonotic disease emergence, both known and unknown, are of critical importance. © 2018 Narat et al. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/.

AB  - Background Several tropical cities are permissive to Aedes aegypti and dengue virus (DENV) endemicity and have allowed for invasion and circulation of Zika virus (ZIKV) in the same areas. People living in arbovirus-endemic regions have been simultaneously infected with ≥2 arboviruses. Methods A. aegypti mosquitoes from Manaus, the capital city of Amazonas State in Brazil, were coinfected with circulating strains of DENV and ZIKV. The coinfected vectors were allowed to bite BALB/c mice. Results A. aegypti from Manaus is highly permissive to monoinfection and coinfection with DENV and ZIKV and is capable of cotransmitting both pathogens by bite. Coinfection strongly influences vector competence, favoring transmission of ZIKV to the vertebrate host. Conclusions This finding suggests that A. aegypti is an efficient vector of ZIKV and that ZIKV would be preferentially transmitted by coinfected A. aegypti. Coinfection in the vector population should be considered a new critical epidemiological factor and may represent a major public health challenge. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - It is now well supported that 20% of human cancers have an infectious causation (i.e., oncogenic agents). Accumulating evidence suggests that aside from this direct role, other infectious agents may also indirectly affect cancer epidemiology through interactions with the oncogenic agents within the wider infection community. Here, we address this hypothesis via analysis of large-scale global data to identify associations between human cancer incidence and assemblages of neglected infectious agents. We focus on a gradient of three widely-distributed cancers with an infectious cause: bladder (~2% of recorded cancer cases are due to Shistosoma haematobium), liver (~60% consecutive to Hepatitis B and C infection) and stomach (Helicobacter pylori is associated with ~70% of cases). We analyzed countries in tropical and temperate regions separately, and controlled for many confounding social and economic variables. First, we found that particular assemblages of bacteria are associated with bladder cancer incidences. Second, we observed a specific and robust association between helminths and liver cancer incidences in both biomes. Third, we show that certain assemblages of viruses may facilitate stomach cancer in tropical area, while others protect against its development in temperate countries. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results in terms of cancer prevention and highlight the necessity to consider neglected diseases, especially in tropics, to adapt public health strategies against infectious diseases and cancer. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Gastrointestinal parasite are the most important and common infectious agents of human and animals worldwide especially in tropical areas. Humans can be infected with the parasites as zoonoses by shedding their infective stage and eggs via feces of animal reservoirs resulting in environmental contamination of food and water. In Maha Sarakham, Kosamphi forest park is an interesting area which has close interaction and coexistence between wildlife, domestic animals and humans where it is possible to transmit some zoonotic pathogens including gastrointestinal parasites among them. This study was conducted to investigate the occurrence of gastrointestinal parasites present in feces of long-tailed macaques, dogs and cattle shed on the environment in and around Kosamphi forest park. A total of 134 fecal samples collected from 3 animal species were processed to detect helminth eggs using the formalin-ethyl acetate technique. Three species of parasitic helminthes including Strongyloides spp., Trichuris spp. and hookworm’s eggs have been detected and assessed for their prevalence. Strongyloides spp., were the most common zoonotic parasite found in monkeys and cattle (52.24% and 45.71%) followed by hookworms (26.87% and 34.29%) while hookworms were the most common zoonotic parasite in dogs (31.25%) followed by Stron-gyloides spp. (25%). This study provides baseline information on potentially zoonotic gastrointestinal parasites in animal reservoirs at Kosamphi forest park and emphasizes the importance of both wildlife and domestic animals as reservoir hosts for zoonotic disease. A One Health Approach is necessary for prevention and control. © 2018, Chiang Mai University - Faculty of Veterinary Medicine. All rights reserved.

AB  - Leptospirosis remains one of the most widespread zoonotic diseases caused by spirochetes of the genus Leptospira, which accounts for high morbidity and mortality globally. Leptospiral infections are often found in tropical and subtropical regions, with people exposed to contaminated environments or animal reservoirs are at high risk of getting the infection. Leptospirosis has a wide range of clinical manifestations with non-specific signs and symptoms and often misdiagnosed with other acute febrile illnesses at early stage of infection. Despite being one of the leading causes of zoonotic morbidity worldwide, there is still a gap between pathogenesis and human immune responses during leptospiral infection. It still remains obscure whether the severity of the infection is caused by the pathogenic properties of the Leptospira itself, or it is a consequence of imbalance host immune factors. Hence, in this review, we seek to summarize the past and present milestone findings on the biomarkers of host immune response aspects during human leptospiral infection, including cytokine and other immune mediators. A profound understanding of the interlink between virulence factors and host immune responses during human leptospirosis is imperative to identify potential biomarkers for diagnostic and prognostic applications as well as designing novel immunotherapeutic strategies in future. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH

AB  - International travel with children, which is the opportunity for the family to see the world together, has become commonplace. If you are travelling with children the journey needs to be carefully planned, especially in cases of visiting a region with harsh environment or poor sanitation. It is particularly important in terms of thermoregulation (hot climate) and the immune system (protection against pathogens causing infectious and invasive diseases) as these are not fully developed in small children. In addition, it is important to maintain appropriate safety and security measures in the destination area (e.g. using child car seats during drive, supervising children during recreational activities in water and on land, avoiding contact with undomesticated animals). Moreover, it is essential to prepare a travel health kit containing drugs appropriate for young travellers - matched for their age and body weight, and to purchase personal prevention products for everyday use (sunscreen with a high sun protection factor, insect repellents, etc.). © 2018 PSMTTM.

AB  - Dengue is a major worldwide problem in tropical and subtropical areas; it is caused by four different viral serotypes, and it can manifest as asymptomatic, mild, or severe. Many factors interact to determine the severity of the disease, including the genetic profile of the infected patient. However, the mechanisms that lead to severe disease and eventually death have not been determined, and a great challenge is the early identification of patients who are more likely to progress to a worse health condition. Studies performed in regions with cyclic outbreaks such as Cuba, Brazil, and Colombia have demonstrated that African ancestry confers protection against severe dengue. Highlighting the host genetics as an important factor in infectious diseases, a large number of association studies between genetic polymorphisms and dengue outcomes have been published in the last two decades. The most widely used approach involves case-control studies with candidate genes, such as the HLA locus and genes for receptors, cytokines, and other immune mediators. Additionally, a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) identified SNPs associated with African ethnicity that had not previously been identified in case-control studies. Despite the increasing number of publications in America, Africa, and Asia, the results are quite controversial, and a meta-analysis is needed to assess the consensus among the studies. SNPs in the MICB, TNF, CD209, FcγRIIA, TPSAB1, CLEC5A, IL10 and PLCE1 genes are associated with the risk or protection of severe dengue, and the findings have been replicated in different populations. A thorough understanding of the viral, human genetic, and immunological mechanisms of dengue and how they interact is essential for effectively preventing dengue, but also managing and treating patients. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Climate change refers to variation in normal climatic conditions and is evidenced through abnormal increase in surface temperature, irregular rainfall patterns, and higher incidence of extreme events. Shift from specific climatic pattern may lead to compromised health, productivity, and immune functions in sheep. Further, pest and disease occurrence in a region is strongly correlated with the prevailing weather conditions and adopted management practices. The varying climatic conditions affect the disease incidences in sheep by influencing their immune competence, virulence of infectious agents, and strength of transmission mecha nisms. Elevated environmental temperature due to climate change may lead to increased development rate in certain infectious pathogens and cause higher population size. In addition, climatic factors such as temperature, humidity, and rainfall are established to affect the vector population dynamics and disease transmission potential. Severe water stress along with heat stress can cause immune suppression in sheep during summer. Moreover, studies established a strong positive correlation between frequency of extreme events and pest and disease incidences. Hence to control the spread of disease and pest among sheep population, suitable multiple adaptation and management practices should be promoted in arid and semiarid tropical regions. The severe effects of heat stress on the sheep can be reduced by management strategies such as shearing wool prior to the onset of hot weather, providing plenty of cool and fresh water, and stall feeding to prevent direct incidence of solar radiation. In addition, integrated pasture development could be practiced through adoption of drought-tolerant varieties to ensure regular pasture supply. These efforts will improve the immune status and thereby help the sheep to counter disease-causing pathogens. Developing disease-tolerant breeds is a long-term adaptive strategy to tackle cli mate change impacts. Further, modeling and forecasting of disease-spreading patterns assist the farmers to take proper precautionary measures against the pathogens. Moreover, disease management practices such as isolation of infected animals and vaccination against frequently occurring diseases also prevent the disease outbreaks in a particular region. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.

AB  - Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) are considered a major threat to global health. Most EIDs appear to result from increased contact between wildlife and humans, especially when humans encroach into formerly pristine habitats. Habitat deterioration may also negatively affect the physiology and health of wildlife species, which may eventually lead to a higher susceptibility to infectious agents and/or increased shedding of the pathogens causing EIDs. Bats are known to host viruses closely related to important EIDs. Here, we tested in a paleotropical forest with ongoing logging and fragmentation, whether habitat disturbance influences the occurrence of astro- and coronaviruses in eight bat species. In contrast to our hypothesis, anthropogenic habitat disturbance was not associated with corona- and astrovirus detection rates in fecal samples. However, we found that bats infected with either astro- or coronaviruses were likely to be coinfected with the respective other virus. Additionally, we identified two more risk factors influencing astrovirus shedding. First, the detection rate of astroviruses was higher at the beginning of the rainy compared to the dry season. Second, there was a trend that individuals with a poor body condition had a higher probability of shedding astroviruses in their feces. The identification of risk factors for increased viral shedding that may potentially result in increased interspecies transmission is important to prevent viral spillovers from bats to other animals, including humans. © 2017, EcoHealth Alliance.

AB  - Background Strongyloides stercoralis is frequently under-diagnosed due to the low sensitivity of common faecal diagnostic methods used in clinical laboratories. This leads to a belief that prevalence is low and that S. stercoralis is not an important soil-transmitted helminth (STH). S. stercoralis diagnostic methods with higher sensitivity are available but often not used. Reasons for their lack of use need to be identified and addressed in order to increase awareness of this neglected parasite. Methodology/principal findings A survey was conducted with public health (14) and private laboratories (15) within the Caribbean region to determine current diagnostic methods used and technological capabilities within the laboratories. Formal-ether concentration and direct smears were the primary methods used. Five of the laboratories used a specific method for S. stercoralis (Baermann and/or agar plate culture). A Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for a modified Baermann tailored to be compatible with the technological capabilities of the laboratories was developed and demonstrated at ten laboratories to determine limitations to adopting a S. stercoralis specific method. The primary limitations were: cost of using two diagnostic methods for one submitted sample; lack of communication with the physician regarding the reason for the faecal analysis; general lack of awareness of S. stercoralis; and lack of awareness of differences in sensitivity of diagnostic methods. Conclusions/significance Changing diagnostic methods involves more than ensuring the method fits within the technological capabilities of the laboratories. Several factors that influence the method used are external to the laboratory. To improve diagnosis of any of the STHs, these external factors must be addressed. Within the laboratory, more education on the sensitivity of diagnostic methods, differences in excretion levels of diagnostic stages with low infection, and increased awareness of S. stercoralis is required. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Tropical infectious disease prevalence is dependent on many socio-cultural determinants. However, rainfall and temperature frequently underlie overall prevalence, particularly for vector-borne diseases. As a result these diseases have increased prevalence in tropical as compared to temperate regions. Specific to tropical Africa, the tendency to incorrectly infer that tropical diseases are uniformly prevalent has been partially overcome with solid epidemiologic data. This finer resolution data is important in multiple contexts, including understanding risk, predictive value in disease diagnosis, and population immunity. We hypothesized that within the context of a tropical climate, vector-borne pathogen prevalence would significantly differ according to zonal differences in rainfall, temperature, relative humidity and vegetation condition. We then determined if these environmental data were predictive of pathogen prevalence. First we determined the prevalence of three major pathogens of cattle, Anaplasma marginale, Babesia bigemina and Theileria spp, in the three vegetation zones where cattle are predominantly raised in Ghana: Guinea savannah, semideciduous forest, and coastal savannah. The prevalence of A. marginale was 63%, 26% for Theileria spp and 2% forB. bigemina. A. marginale and Theileria spp. were significantly more prevalent in the coastal savannah as compared to either the Guinea savanna or the semi-deciduous forest, supporting acceptance of the first hypothesis. To test the predictive power of environmental variables, the data over a three year period were considered in best subsets multiple linear regression models predicting prevalence of each pathogen. Corrected Akaike Information Criteria (AICc) were assigned to the alternative models to compare their utility. Competitive models for each response were averaged using AICc weights. Rainfall was most predictive of pathogen prevalence, and EVI also contributed to A marginale and B. bigemina prevalence. These findings support the utility of environmental data for understanding vector-borne disease epidemiology on a regional level within a tropical environment.

AB  - Introduction: Cholera, an infectious diarrheal disease, has been shown to be associated with large scale hydroclimatic processes. The sudden and sporadic occurrence of epidemic cholera is linked with high mortality rates, in part, due to uncertainty in timing and location of outbreaks. Improved understanding of the relationship between pathogenic abundance and climatic processes allows prediction of disease outbreak to be an achievable goal. In this study, we show association of large scale hydroclimatic processes with the cholera epidemic in Zimbabwe reported to have begun in Chitungwiza, a city in Mashonaland East province, in August, 2008. Principal Findings: Climatic factors in the region were found to be associated with triggering cholera outbreak and are shown to be related to anomalies of temperature and precipitation, validating the hypothesis that poor conditions of sanitation, coupled with elevated temperatures, and followed by heavy rainfall can initiate outbreaks of cholera. Spatial estimation by satellite of precipitation and global gridded air temperature captured sensitivities in hydroclimatic conditions that permitted identification of the location in the region where the disease outbreak began. Discussion: Satellite derived hydroclimatic processes can be used to capture environmental conditions related to epidemic cholera, as occurred in Zimbabwe, thereby providing an early warning system. Since cholera cannot be eradicated because the causative agent, Vibrio cholerae, is autochthonous to the aquatic environment, prediction of conditions favorable for its growth and estimation of risks of triggering the disease in a given population can be used to alert responders, potentially decreasing infection and saving lives. © 2015 Jutla et al.

AB  - Vector-borne diseases use to be a major public health concern only in tropical and subtropical areas, but today they are an emerging threat for the continental and developed countries also. Nowadays, in intercontinental countries, there is a struggle with emerging diseases, which have found their way to appear through vectors. Vector-borne zoonotic diseases occur when vectors, animal hosts, climate conditions, pathogens, and susceptible human population exist at the same time, at the same place. Global climate change is predicted to lead to an increase in vector-borne infectious diseases and disease outbreaks. It could affect the range and population of pathogens, host and vectors, transmission season, etc. Reliable surveillance for diseases that are most likely to emerge is required. Canine vector-borne diseases represent a complex group of diseases including anaplasmosis, babesiosis, bartonellosis, borreliosis, dirofilariosis, ehrlichiosis, and leishmaniosis. Some of these diseases cause serious clinical symptoms in dogs and some of them have a zoonotic potential with an effect to public health. It is expected from veterinarians in coordination with medical doctors to play a fundamental role at primarily prevention and then treatment of vector-borne diseases in dogs. The One Health concept has to be integrated into the struggle against emerging diseases. During a 4-year period, from 2009 to 2013, a total number of 551 dog samples were analyzed for vector-borne diseases (borreliosis, babesiosis, ehrlichiosis, anaplasmosis, dirofilariosis, and leishmaniasis) in routine laboratory work. The analysis was done by serological tests-ELISA for borreliosis, dirofilariosis, and leishmaniasis, modified Knott test for dirofilariosis, and blood smear for babesiosis, ehrlichiosis, and anaplasmosis. This number of samples represented 75% of total number of samples that were sent for analysis for different diseases in dogs. Annually, on average more then half of the samples brought to the laboratory to analysis for different infectious diseases are analyzed for vector-borne diseases. In the region of Vojvodina (northern part of Serbia), the following vector-borne infectious diseases have been found in dogs so far borreliosis, babesiosis, dirofilariosis, leishmaniasis, and anaplasmosis. © 2014 Savić, Vidić, Grgić, Potkonjak and Spasojevic.

AB  - An estimated 60– 75% of the world’s infectious diseases of humans are zoonotic, infecting both humans and other animals. Many are vectorborne, relying on transmission by mosquitoes and biting flies that are aquatic for much of their lifespan. Others rely on aquatic molluscs, fishes, or other aquatic animals for completion of their transmission cycles, and others develop and thrive in diverse freshwater environments outside any host. While such diseases remain firmly endemic in many areas, new outbreaks of infectious diseases associated with freshwater have occurred throughout the world, and many others have spread to new locations. This may involve introduction of aquatic vectors into locations where the disease was previously unknown, as in the recent occurrences of mosquito-transmitted diseases such as West Nile Virus in North America, dengue fever in southern Europe, Chikungunya virus in the Caribbean and South America, and dirofilariasis in Central and Eastern Europe. Such a pattern is also possible with such major human pathogens as Schistosoma blood flukes and food-borne trematodes, through introduction of aquatic host snails from long-established foci in other areas. Alternatively, waterborne pathogens may be introduced directly, leading to disease outbreaks such as the cholera disaster still unfolding in Haiti. Accidental or intentional introduction of pathogens or their aquatic vectors and hosts are among the primary concerns that affect international trade, travel, and global health security. These concerns are compounded by the prospect of warming climate, potentially resulting in primarily tropical diseases encroaching into historically subtropical or temperate regions. Thus, we must be prepared for the possibility of geographic spread of diseases into areas where they have not occurred, or reintroduction into areas where they once occurred but have been eliminated through control measures. For example, North America and Europe are at risk for reintroduction of such major “tropical” diseases as malaria and yellow fever, and thus must come under increasing scrutiny, starting with surveillance of freshwater systems for both established and potentially invasive vector and host populations. This critical perspective paper briefly reviews selected previous cases in which aquatic invasive species have contributed to infectious disease emergence, re-emergence, or increase, and proposes One Health strategies for integrating human, animal, and environmental monitoring and surveillance to better prepare for or prevent geographic spread of major human health threats associated with aquatic systems. © 2014 The Author(s).

AB  - The four dengue virus (DENV) serotypes, DENV-1, -2, -3, and -4, are endemic throughout tropical and subtropical regions of the world, with an estimated 390 million acute infections annually. Infection confers long-term protective immunity against the infecting serotype, but secondary infection with a different serotype carries a greater risk of potentially fatal severe dengue disease, including dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. The single most effective measure to control this threat to global health is a tetravalent DENV vaccine. To date, attempts to develop a protective vaccine have progressed slowly, partly because the targets of type-specific human neutralizing antibodies (NAbs), which are critical for long-term protection, remain poorly defined, impeding our understanding of natural immunity and hindering effective vaccine development. Here, we show that the envelope glycoprotein domain I/II hinge of DENV-3 and DENV-4 is the primary target of the long-term type-specific NAb response in humans. Transplantation of a DENV-4 hinge into a recombinant DENV-3 virus showed that the hinge determines the serotype-specific neutralizing potency of primary human and nonhuman primate DENV immune sera and that the hinge region both induces NAbs and is targeted by protective NAbs in rhesus macaques. These results suggest that the success of live dengue vaccines may depend on their ability to stimulate NAbs that target the envelope glycoprotein domain I/II hinge region. More broadly, this study shows that complex conformational antibody epitopes can be transplanted between live viruses, opening up similar possibilities for improving the breadth and specificity of vaccines for influenza, HIV, hepatitis C virus, and other clinically important viral pathogens.

AB  - Leptospirosis is a worldwide zoonotic infection with a much greater incidence in tropical regions and has now been identified as one of the emerging infectious diseases, particularly associated with travel and recreational activities. The epidemiology of leptospirosis has been modified with changes in animal husbandry, climate, and human behavior. Resurgent interest in leptospirosis has resulted from large outbreaks that have received significant publicity. This zoonotic infection represents a significant risk through contaminated water and food as a foodborne disease. In this article, different epidemiological and clinical aspects as well as its implication for food safety have been reviewed. © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Chikungunya was, from the European perspective, considered to be a travel-related tropical mosquito-borne disease prior to the first European outbreak in Northern Italy in 2007. This was followed by cases of autochthonous transmission reported in South-eastern France in 2010. Both events occurred after the introduction, establishment and expansion of the Chikungunya-competent and highly invasive disease vector Aedes albopictus (Asian tiger mosquito) in Europe. In order to assess whether these outbreaks are indicative of the beginning of a trend or one-off events, there is a need to further examine the factors driving the potential transmission of Chikungunya in Europe. The climatic suitability, both now and in the future, is an essential starting point for such an analysis.Methods: The climatic suitability for Chikungunya outbreaks was determined by using bioclimatic factors that influence, both vector and, pathogen. Climatic suitability for the European distribution of the vector Aedes albopictus was based upon previous correlative environmental niche models. Climatic risk classes were derived by combining climatic suitability for the vector with known temperature requirements for pathogen transmission, obtained from outbreak regions. In addition, the longest potential intra-annual season for Chikungunya transmission was estimated for regions with expected vector occurrences.In order to analyse spatio-temporal trends for risk exposure and season of transmission in Europe, climate change impacts are projected for three time-frames (2011-2040, 2041-2070 and 2071-2100) and two climate scenarios (A1B and B1) from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). These climatic projections are based on regional climate model COSMO-CLM, which builds on the global model ECHAM5.Results: European areas with current and future climatic suitability of Chikungunya transmission are identified. An increase in risk is projected for Western Europe (e.g. France and Benelux-States) in the first half of the 21st century and from mid-century onwards for central parts of Europe (e.g. Germany). Interestingly, the southernmost parts of Europe do not generally provide suitable conditions in these projections. Nevertheless, many Mediterranean regions will persist to be climatically suitable for transmission. Overall, the highest risk of transmission by the end of the 21st century was projected for France, Northern Italy and the Pannonian Basin (East-Central Europe). This general tendency is depicted in both, the A1B and B1 climate change scenarios.Conclusion: In order to guide preparedness for further outbreaks, it is crucial to anticipate risk as to identify areas where specific public health measures, such as surveillance and vector control, can be implemented. However, public health practitioners need to be aware that climate is only one factor driving the transmission of vector-borne disease. © 2013 Fischer et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Climate and weather influence the occurrence, distribution, and incidence of infectious diseases, particularly those caused by vector-borne or zoonotic pathogens. Thus, models based on meteorological data have helped predict when and where human cases are most likely to occur. Such knowledge aids in targeting limited prevention and control resources and may ultimately reduce the burden of diseases. Paradoxically, localities where such models could yield the greatest benefits, such as tropical regions where morbidity and mortality caused by vector-borne diseases is greatest, often lack high-quality in situ local meteorological data. Satellite- and model-based gridded climate datasets can be used to approximate local meteorological conditions in data-sparse regions, however their accuracy varies. Here we investigate how the selection of a particular dataset can influence the outcomes of disease forecasting models. Our model system focuses on plague (Yersinia pestis infection) in the West Nile region of Uganda. The majority of recent human cases have been reported from East Africa and Madagascar, where meteorological observations are sparse and topography yields complex weather patterns. Using an ensemble of meteorological datasets and model-averaging techniques we find that the number of suspected cases in the West Nile region was negatively associated with dry season rainfall (December-February) and positively with rainfall prior to the plague season. We demonstrate that ensembles of available meteorological datasets can be used to quantify climatic uncertainty and minimize its impacts on infectious disease models. These methods are particularly valuable in regions with sparse observational networks and high morbidity and mortality from vector-borne diseases.

AB  - Objective To evaluate the causes and risks for imported skin disorders among travellers. Methods Data of 34162 travellers returning from tropical and non-tropical countries and presenting at the outpatient travel medicine clinic of the University of Munich, Germany, between 1999 and 2009 were analyzed for this study. Of these, 12.2% were diagnosed with skin disorders. Results Main destinations visited were Asia (40%), Africa (27%) and Latin America (21%). Tourism in the form of adventure travel/backpacking (47%) and package holidays (23%) was the most common purpose of travel. The leading causes of skin disorders were arthropodal (23%), bacterial (22%), helminthic (11%), protozoan (6%), viral (6%), allergic (5%) and fungal (4%). The 10 most frequently diagnosed specific skin diseases associated with specific destinations were insect bites (17%, Southern Europe), cutaneous larva migrans (8%, Asia and Latin America), cutaneous leishmaniasis (2.4%, Mediterranean Region/Middle East), dengue fever (1.5%, Asia), rickettsioses (1.3%, Southern Africa), myiasis (0.8%, Central America), filarioses (0.7%, Africa), tick bites (0.6%, Central/Eastern Europe), schistosomiasis (0.6%, Africa) and tungiasis (0.6%, Africa). Travellers in sub-Saharan Africa had the highest relative risk of acquiring skin disorders. Conclusion As more than 20% of all skin disorders among returned travellers were caused by arthropods and about 50% by infectious pathogens, pre-travel consultations should include specific prophylaxis and consider the most important risk factor for the travel destination. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The recent explosion in world population growth and the mass movement of people into developed forest in tropical and subtropical areas has dramatically increased the potential for humans to come into contact with new species and strains of pathogens. For example, many investigators believe that the Ebola, HIV, and SARS viruses are all zoonotic pathogens, transmitted from animal hosts to man. New pathogens, such as the Ebola virus, the AIDS virus (HIV), hemorrhagic colon bacillus O-157, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), avian influenza virus A (H5N1) are all emerging diseases. It is not possible to predict whether avian influenza virus A (H5N1) will become next human influenza pandemic virus. Malaria control cannot eliminate the mosquito vector, the parasite, and the favorable environmental conditions for transmission of the parasite, thus, the creation of new anti-malaria interventions including therapeutic drugs, vector control tools, diagnostic methods, and vaccines are urgently needed for control and prevention. International travel to developing countries may introduce new health risks, with poor quality of accommodation, inadequate hygiene and sanitation, underdeveloped medical services, and unavailability of clean water. Travelers must take measures to avoid illness, thus, vaccinations and anti-malarial medication are required. Such travel has promoted the spread of infections such as dengue, hepatitis A, West Nile, hemorrhagic fevers, and malaria that are prevalent in Africa and Asia. It is thought that global infectious disease surveillance and response networks are required for control and prevention of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) with international cooperation partners. This short review focuses on avian influenza A (H5N1), swine influenza A (H1N1) virus (S-OIV) as an emerging disease, malaria as a re-emerging disease, and the importance of infectious diseases acquired via overseas travel to tropical areas. © 2010 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - The helminthic infections that can cause eosinophilic meningitis (EM) share many of the characteristics of emerging infectious diseases, such as the influences of international trade and travel on pathogen dissemination in a warming ecosystem. In order to assess the evolving epidemiology of EM worldwide, define the case diagnosis of EM based on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) microscopy, and stratify the causes of EM as infectious versus noninfectious; this review analyzes scientific articles selected by MEDLINE search, 1966-2009. In addition, this review compares the clinical manifestations, management, and outcomes of the most common causes of helminthic EM worldwide in order to alert clinicians to populations at increased risk of helminthic EM as a result of age, ethnicity, lifestyle, food choices, location of permanent residence, or recent travel. The most common helminthic causes of EM worldwide are angiostrongyliasis and gnathostomiasis. Angiostrongyliasis, a rodent zoonosis endemic in Southeast Asia, was imported to North and South America and the Caribbean following the embarkation of infected rodents from cargo ships. Gnathostomiasis, a zoonosis of wild carnivores in Southeast Asia and Latin America, has been recently recognized as an emerging cause of EM in travelers returning to England and the United States (US). Baylisascariasis, a North American raccoon zoonosis, is an additional, although unusual, emerging cause of EM, that has extended distribution range across the US since the 1980s, and was exported to Japan by the exotic pet trade. Although EM occurs worldwide, its differential diagnosis is limited to infectious and non-infectious etiologies with non-infectious etiologies, such as intracranial hardware and malignancies, causing more cases, especially in regions that are not endemic for the most common causative parasites. Most cases of helminthic EM can be prevented by public health education, human behavior modification, and proper food preparation. © 2010 by The Japanese Society of Tropical Medicine.

AB  - Worldwide increases in human and wildlife diseases have challenged ecologists to understand how large-scale environmental changes affect host-parasite interactions. One of the most profound changes to Earth's ecosystems is the alteration of global nutrient cycles, including those of phosphorus (P) and especially nitrogen (N). Along with the obvious direct benefits of nutrient application for food production, anthropogenic inputs of N and P can indirectly affect the abundance of infectious and noninfectious pathogens. The mechanisms underpinning observed correlations, however, and how such patterns vary with disease type, have long remained conjectural. Here, we highlight recent experimental advances to critically evaluate the relationship between environmental nutrient enrichment and disease. Given the interrelated nature of human and wildlife disease emergence, we include a broad range of human and wildlife examples from terrestrial, marine, and freshwater ecosystems. We examine the consequences of nutrient pollution on directly transmitted, vector-borne, complex life cycle, and noninfectious pathogens, including West Nile virus, malaria, harmful algal blooms, coral reef diseases, and amphibian malformations. Our synthetic examination suggests that the effects of environmental nutrient enrichment on disease are complex and multifaceted, varying with the type of pathogen, host species and condition, attributes of the ecosystem, and the degree of enrichment; some pathogens increase in abundance whereas others decline or disappear. Nevertheless, available evidence indicates that ecological changes associated with nutrient enrichment often exacerbate infection and disease caused by generalist parasites with direct or simple life cycles. Observed mechanisms include changes in host/vector density, host distribution, infection resistance, pathogen virulence or toxicity, and the direct supplementation of pathogens. Collectively, these pathogens may be particularly dangerous because they can continue to cause mortality even as their hosts decline, potentially leading to sustained epidemics or chronic pathology. We suggest that interactions between nutrient enrichment and disease will become increasingly important in tropical and subtropical regions, where forecasted increases in nutrient application will occur in an environment rich with infectious pathogens. We emphasize the importance of careful disease management in conjunction with continued intensification of global nutrient cycles. © 2010 by the Ecological Society of America.

AB  - Asia is a highly heterogeneous region with vastly different cultures, social constitutions and populations affected by a wide spectrum of respiratory diseases caused by tropical pathogens. Asian patients with community-acquired pneumonia differ from their Western counterparts in microbiological aetiology, in particular the prominence of Gram-negative organisms, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Burkholderia pseudomallei and Staphylococcus aureus. In addition, the differences in socioeconomic and health-care infrastructures limit the usefulness of Western management guidelines for pneumonia in Asia. The importance of emerging infectious diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome and avian influenza infection remain as close concerns for practising respirologists in Asia. Specific infections such as melioidosis, dengue haemorrhagic fever, scrub typhus, leptospirosis, salmonellosis, penicilliosis marneffei, malaria, amoebiasis, paragonimiasis, strongyloidiasis, gnathostomiasis, trinchinellosis, schistosomiasis and echinococcosis occur commonly in Asia and manifest with a prominent respiratory component. Pulmonary eosinophilia, endemic in parts of Asia, could occur with a wide range of tropical infections. Tropical eosinophilia is believed to be a hyper-sensitivity reaction to degenerating microfilariae trapped in the lungs. This article attempts to address the key respiratory issues in these respiratory infections unique to Asia and highlight the important diagnostic and management issues faced by practising respirologists. © 2008 The Authors.

AB  - The brunt of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) pandemic has been borne disproportionately by resource-poor regions of the world, where tropical infectious diseases continue to hold greatest sway. As a result, our understanding of the epidemiological, biological, and clinical interactions between HIV and tropical pathogens has lagged, compared with our understanding of the interactions between HIV and pathogens that are common in the industrialized world. Because of the current rapid expansion of HIV care in the tropics, with increasing resources being made available, an overview of the available data is timely. Tropical protozoa are discussed here; other tropical pathogens are discussed in a related mini-review in this issue of Clinical Infectious Diseases. © 2007 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

AB  - Companion animals are increasingly brought along by their owners to foreign countries. Thus, small animal travel medicine is becoming more important. The field includes both prophylaxis and metaphylaxis against various infectious diseases, as well as their diagnosis and treatment. Dogs returning from Southern Europe, but also from more tropical regions, may be infected with exotic pathogens. In addition, imported pedigree or working dogs, and especially stray dogs imported through welfare organisations, are at high risk. The present overview summarises the clinical and practical aspects of exotic parasitic diseases that may affect such dogs, and the risk of such diseases becoming autochthonously transmitted in Switzerland. Furthermore, the zoonotic potential of these infections will be considered. ©2006 by Verlag Hans Huber, Hogrefe AG.

AB  - To investigate the epidemiology and outcome of adult community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in tropical Australia. A prospective study was performed of all adult patients with CAP admitted to the Royal Darwin Hospital, a major hospital in tropical northern Australia. A standard definition of CAP was used and data collected on demographics, risk factors, history, examination, investigations, treatment and outcome. Locally-developed treatment guidelines were used. One hundred and sixty-seven adults were included in the analysis. Aboriginal people were over-represented, younger and were more likely to have risk factors for CAP. The most frequent pathogens isolated were Streptococcus pneumoniae and Burkholderia pseudomallei. 'Atypical pneumonia' organisms were uncommon. Treatment guidelines included penicillin for mild pneumonia but emphasised coverage of Burkholderia pseudomallei in those with risk factors, especially during the monsoon season. The mortality rate from pneumonia was low with three deaths in 167 cases (1.8%). International guidelines for the management of CAP have been based on populations and organisms from temperate regions and may not necessarily be applicable to tropical regions. Guidelines based upon local epidemiology must therefore be developed. This study illustrates how mortality can be minimised using a process of determining local CAP etiology, developing treatment guidelines and auditing patient management. © 2005 International Society for Infectious Diseases.

AB  - Background. Group B streptococcus (GBS) is a leading cause of neonatal sepsis in many industrialized countries, but reports from the developing world infrequently identify this pathogen among newborns with sepsis. Studies of GBS colonization among women living in developing countries were reviewed to determine whether lower colonization rates might account for these findings. Methods. Literature was reviewed with the use of Medline Express (1980 to 1996) and Abstracts on Tropical Agriculture and Rural Development in the Tropics (1975 to 1995). The methods of each report were considered adequate if specimens were collected from the vagina and if selective broth media were used. Results. Thirty-four studies reported results of cultures from 7730 women; overall colonization was 12.7%. Among only those studies in which methods were adequate, 17.8% (675 of 3801) women were identified as colonized. Studies with adequate methods found significantly higher colonization rates (relative risk, 2.3; 95% confidence interval, 2.0 to 2.6) than those using inadequate methods. When analysis was restricted to reports with adequate methods, the prevalence of colonization by region was as follows: Middle East/North Africa, 22%; Asia/Pacific, 19%; Sub-Saharan Africa, 19%; India/Pakistan, 12%; and Americas, 14%. Conclusion. Although there is significant geographic variation in the proportion of women colonized with GBS, the range of colonization reported from developing countries is similar to that identified in populations studied in the United States. Specimen collection and microbiologic methods are important factors in identification of women colonized with GBS.
