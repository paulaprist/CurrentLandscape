AB  - CAUutaneous: Pleaseconfirmthatallheadinglevelsarerepresentedcorrectly: leishmaniasis (CL) due to Leishmania tropica is a neglected tropical disease characterized by a wide geographical distribution in the Mediterranean basin and is endemic in several of its countries. In addition, the vector Phlebotomus sergenti is abundantly present all around the basin. Its transmission cycle is still subject to debate. In some countries, the presence of an animal reservoir has been confirmed. In Morocco, CL due to L. tropica has risen since the 1980s and has spread widely to become the most abundant form of leishmaniasis in the territory. However, the anthroponotic transmission is so far the only recognized mode, despite recordings of L. tropica infection in animal hosts. In this review article, we assess the situation of CL due to L. tropica in the Mediterranean basin with a focus on Morocco and gather knowledge about any potential zoonotic transmission in the country. A concomitant zoonotic transmission could explain the persistence of the disease in areas where human protective measures combined with vector management did not help reduce the disease burden. © 2022 El Idrissi Saik et al.

AB  - The order Carnivora includes over 300 species that vary many orders of magnitude in size and inhabit all major biomes, from tropical rainforests to polar seas. The high diversity of carnivore parasites represents a source of potential emerging diseases of humans. Zoonotic risk from this group may be driven in part by exceptionally high functional diversity of host species in behavioral, physiological, and ecological traits. We review global macroecological patterns of zoonotic parasites within carnivores, and explore the traits of species that serve as hosts of zoonotic parasites. We synthesize theoretical and empirical research and suggest future work on the roles of carnivores as biotic multipliers, regulators, and sentinels of zoonotic disease as timely research frontiers. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - To accommodate recent worldwide explosion in population growth, people have undertaken the deforestation of land in tropical and subtropical areas. This process drastically increases the potential for contact between humans and new species and strains of pathogens. For example, many investigators believe that the Ebola virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) are all zoonotic pathogens, (i.e., transmitted from animal hosts to humans). New pathogens such as the Ebola virus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and avian influenza virus A (H5N1) are all considered emerging diseases. It is not possible to predict whether H5N1 will become the next causative virus of a human influenza pandemic. Control of these viruses cannot eliminate intermediary hosts, viruses, and favorable environmental conditions for the transmission of these viruses; thus, new antiviral interventions, including therapeutic drugs, intermediary hosts control tools, diagnostic methods, and vaccines, are urgently needed for control and prevention. International travel to developing countries may introduce new health risks, associated with poor quality accommodations, inadequate hygiene and sanitation, underdeveloped medical services, and the unavailability of clean water. Travelers must take measures to avoid illness; thus, vaccinations and antimalarial medication are required. International travel has promoted the spreading of infections such as dengue, hepatitis A, West Nile fever, hemorrhagic fevers, and malaria, which are prevalent in Africa and Asia. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO), along with their international co-operation partners, consider global infectious disease surveillance and response networks necessary for the control and prevention of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. Recently, a catastrophic Ebola virus outbreak, suddenly emerged in Guinea in early 2014, after which the virus rapidly spread to Sierra Leone and Liberia. The Ebola virus is considered an important public health threat with respect to biological terrorism in West Africa. There is a need for better surveillance and rapid action based on the available real-time information. Emerging infections have a tremendous impact on the magnitude of threats to humankind. There is an urgent need for a better understanding of emerging infections, as well as to act more effectively with regard to prevention and control. This review focuses on SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, H5N1, swine influenza A virus, and Ebola virus as emerging diseases. These emerging infections are also important with regard to viral infectious diseases acquired via overseas travel to tropical, and/or endemic areas. © 2016 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - Around 25% of the global population suffer from one or more parasitic infections, of which food- and vector-borne parasitic zoonotic diseases are a major concern. Additionally, zoonoses and communicable diseases, common to man and animals, are drawing increased attention worldwide. Significant changes in climatic conditions, cropping pattern, demography, food habits, increasing international travel, marketing and trade, deforestation, and urbanization play vital roles in the emergence and re-emergence of parasitic zoonoses. Although it is likely to be underestimated, the collective burden of food- and vector-borne parasitic diseases accounts for ∼60 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Out of 20 neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) listed by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 13 diseases are of parasitic origin. There are about 200 zoonotic diseases of which the WHO listed eight as neglected zoonotic diseases (NZDs) in the year 2013. Out of these eight NZDs, four diseases, namely cysticercosis, hydatidosis, leishmaniasis, and trypanosomiasis, are caused by parasites. In this review, we discuss the global burden and impacts of food- and vector-borne zoonotic parasitic diseases. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Scrub typhus is an acute infectious illness caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi. It is endemic to a part of the world known as the "tsutsugamushi triangle". Humans are accidental hosts in this zoonotic disease. About a third of patients admitted with scrub typhus have evidence of multi-organ dysfunction. Multi-organ dysfunction secondary to scrub typhus carries a high mortality rate. Case presentation: We report a 65-year old lady who was admitted in a Tertiary Care Center in the state of Kerala in India, with 7 day history of fever, myalgia and reduced urine output. Head to foot examination revealed the presence of an eschar on her chest. One week prior to the onset of her illness she had gone trekking through a hilly forest area. She was clinically suspected to have scrub typhus, which was later confirmed with laboratory tests. She developed multi-organ dysfunction syndrome secondary to this illness. Though there was an improvement in the multi-organ dysfunction, thrombocytopenia alone failed to improve. Bone marrow study was done which was suggestive of immune thrombocytopenia. Patient was given a course of steroids with which the thrombocytopenia improved. Conclusion: Failure of platelet count to normalize even after there has been a general improvement of other markers of multi-organ dysfunction in scrub typhus should prompt the clinician to consider other potential causes of thrombocytopenia. An unusual finding as this calls for further research to understand the molecular mechanisms behind such an event. Further, considering the close similarity in clinical presentation of several tropical illnesses, meticulous history taking and a detailed physical examination needs to be emphasized. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Wildlife remains an important source of zoonotic diseases for the most vulnerable groups of humans, primarily those living in rural areas or coexisting with forest. The Upper Paraná Atlantic forest of Misiones, Argentina is facing ongoing environmental and anthropogenic changes, which affect the local biodiversity, including the bush dog (Speothos venaticus), a small canid considered Near Threatened globally and Endangered locally. This project aimed to expand the knowledge of zoonotic parasites present in the bush dog and the potential implications for human health and conservation medicine. From May to August 2011, a detection dog located 34 scats that were genetically confirmed as bush dog and georeferenced to northern Misiones. Of these 34 scats, 27 had sufficient quantity that allowed processing for zoonotic parasites using morphological (sedimentation and flotation) and antigen (coproantigen technique) analyses. Within these 27 scats, we determined that the parasitic prevalence was 63.0% (n = 17) with 8 (47.1%) having mixed infections with 2-4 parasitic genera. No significant differences (p > 0.05) between sampling areas, sex, and parasite taxa were found. We were able to summarize the predominant nematodes (Ancylostoma caninum, Toxocara canis, and Lagochilascaris spp.), cestodes (Taenia spp. and Spirometra spp.), and apicomplexa (Cystoisospora caninum) found in these bush dogs. With the copro-ELISA technique, 14.8% (n = 4) of the samples were positive for Echinococcus spp. This study represents the first comprehensive study about parasitic fauna with zoonotic potential in the free-ranging bush dog. This information combined with the innovative set of techniques used to collect the samples constitute a valuable contribution that can be used in control programs, surveillance of zoonotic diseases, and wildlife conservation, both regionally and across the bush dog's broad distribution. © Copyright 2016, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2016.

AB  - Primates are facing a global extinction crisis driven by an expanding human population, environmental degradation, the conversion of tropical forests into monocultures for industrial agriculture and cattle ranching, unsustainable resource extraction, hunting, climate change, and the threat of emerging zoonotic diseases. And, although many primate scientists have dedicated their careers to conservation, 65% of primate species are listed as Vulnerable, Endangered, or Critically Endangered, and >75% are experiencing a population decline. Projections indicate that by the end of the century, an additional 75% of the area currently occupied by wild primates will be lost to agriculture. Clearly, we are losing the battle and must change business-as-usual if we are to protect wild primates and their habitats. This article is a call to action. Primate societies and their membership need to expand their engagement in scientific advocacy and scientific activism designed to educate, inspire, organize, and mobilize global citizens to join together, lobby business leaders and politicians in both primate habitat countries and in consumer nations, boycott forest-risk products, participate in demonstrations and letter writing campaigns, and use social media to effect transformational change. We are the experts, and the more we and our professional organizations drive the public policy debate on wildlife conservation and environmental justice, the more successful we will be in protecting the world’s primates from extinction.

AB  - Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease that represents a major problem in animal and public health due to its high prevalence and widespread distribution. This zoonotic disease is most prevalent in tropical environments where conditions favour pathogen survival. The ecological preferences of Leptospira serovars are poorly understood, limiting our knowledge of where and when outbreaks can occur, which may result in misinformed prevention and control plans. While the disease can occur consistently in time and space in tropical regions, research on the ecology of leptospirosis remains limited in subtropical regions. This research gap regarding Leptospira ecology brings public and veterinary health problems, impacting local economies. To fill this gap of knowledge, we suggest to assess geographic and ecological features among Leptospira serovars in a subtropical area of Brazil where leptospirosis is endemic to (a) highlight environmental conditions that facilitate or limit Leptospira spread and survival and (b) reconstruct its geographic distribution. An ecological niche modelling framework was used to characterize and compare Leptospira serovars in both geographic and environmental space. Our results show that despite the geographic overlap exhibited by the different serovars assessed, we found ecological divergence among their occupied ecological niches. Ecological divergences were expressed as ranges of potential distributions and environmental conditions found suitably by serovar, Sejroe being the most asymmetric (<0.15). Most important predictors for the potential distribution of most serovars were soil pH (31.7%) and landscape temperature (24.2%). Identification of environmental preferences will allow epidemiologists to better infer the presence of a serovar based on the environmental characteristics of regions rather than inferences based solely on historical epidemiological records. Including geographic and ecological ranges of serovars also may help to forecast transmission potential of Leptospira in public health and the food animal practice. © 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH

AB  - Leptospirosis is an emerging zoonotic disease endemic in tropical regions. Aiming at assessing the potential infection risks via recreational exposure, the molecular prevalence of pathogenic Leptospira in 14 amenity forests in five selected districts of the state of Perak was determined. Water and soil samples along streams and waterfalls were subjected to culture of leptospires and the pathogenic Leptospira spp. was detected by lipL32-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Twenty out of 154 samples (13%) that tested positive for leptospires were mostly soils and still water recorded with tolerable temperatures (22.2-26.5°C) and pHs (5.73-6.70). The localised prevalence was highly varied among eight positive forests (6.7-41.7%), particularly higher in Kampar and Kinta districts which are the more populated urban areas. The importance of public health surveillance should not be underrated given the high prevalence of Leptospira spp. in forests in close proximity to indigenous settlements, even where the places are clean. Overall, this study discovered a wide distribution of pathogenic Leptospira spp. in recreational areas. © 2021, Malaysian Society for Parasitology. All rights reserved.

AB  - Tropical areas are facing a bushmeat crisis involving the systematic over-exploitation of large-bodied mammals for both subsistence and commercial purposes. We hypothesize that because hunting generally originates from villages, it will create “halos of defaunation” where abundances of large mammals increase with distance away from villages. Whilst such patterns have been well characterized at the landscape scale, examining how defaunation halos vary between different villages has received considerably less attention. Forests immediately surrounding villages are of considerable importance to the people residing within them and the factors hypothesized to influence local defaunation halos (e.g. village size, hunting practices and access to local markets) may affect local livelihoods and the ecological integrity of nearby forests. To address this, we adopted a participatory approach to establish and monitor sixty transects across ten village-distance gradients (1-8 km) in Gabon. Trained paraecologists, recruited from local villages, walked each transect twice monthly to determine the encounter rates of medium and large mammals across the village distance gradient and monitored village-level bushmeat availability. We found that overall rates of mammal observation and estimated species richness were constant across the village-distance gradient, however the total number of individuals encountered and bushmeat biomass were lower close to villages – consistent with local depletion of wildlife. These general trends were underpinned by depleted mammal species diversity with increasing proximity to villages and a marked shift in mammal community composition: small, non-hunted species were encountered most frequently near villages, whereas large, hunted species were encountered most frequently away from villages. We found some evidence for inter-village variation in the strength and depth of defaunation halos, which may be driven in part by the village-level hunting intensity. Several of the key parameters identified in landscape-scale bushmeat studies did not detectably influence village-level defaunation (e.g. road or market distance). Despite the prevalence of bushmeat hunting in the region, the conservation value of forests immediately surrounding villages was demonstrated through the detection of large-bodied species of conservation concern (e.g. chimpanzee and gorilla) at a high proportion of survey locations. The compositional shifts in mammal communities detailed here will ultimately lead to the altered composition and diversity of forests around villages, with potential implications for human livelihoods, health and transmission of zoonotic disease. This research also demonstrates the effectiveness of engaging paraecologists to answer focused ecological questions - the first step in facilitating effective natural resource management by local communities. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Tropical medicine deals with infectious and noninfectious diseases geographically located between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn. It encompasses diseases that result from poverty, poor sanitation, infrastructure, and inadequate health resources. Lack of availability of clean water and food made with unhygienic practices add to the morbidity of these diseases. The tropics are reeling under the onslaught of climate change, deforestation, and air, water, and soil pollution, which worsens an already fragile health system. This article provides an overview of the definition, classification, geophysical problems, syndromic approach to common tropical infections, diagnostic challenges in the tropics, and access to medicines. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background and Aim: Livestock are associated with pathogenic microbes and farm workers play a significant role in the transmission of zoonotic diseases (ZDs). Lack of awareness of exposure risk among farmers may influence their farm practices, thereby enhancing the spread of diseases on farms and to the community. This study was aimed at evaluating the knowledge, risk perception, and prevention and control practices of ZDs among poultry farmers to provide baseline data for establishing a “One Health” practical approach to reducing ZD transmission in poultry farms. Materials and Methods: Using the exponential discriminative snowball technique, a community-based cross-sectional study involving poultry farmers was carried out in the Buea Health District from April to July 2021. Six feed-producing mills were used as focal points to identify and recruit farmers who were also referred to other farmers. Questionnaires were used to collect data related to participants' knowledge, risk perception, and prevention and control practices of ZDs. Descriptive analyses were performed for all variables while the chi-square test and logistic regression analysis were used to determine associations at 95% confidence level. Results: In all, 183 poultry farms and 207 workers were enrolled in the study. Despite being aware that animal diseases can be transmitted to humans, most participants showed poor knowledge (54.6%), low-risk perception (51.7%), and poor prevention/control practices (54.1%) on ZDs. The majority did not consider coming in contact with birds' body fluid (blood) or apparently healthy birds to be a risk of infection. More participants with small farms (<500 birds) had low-risk perception of ZDs than those with larger farms (>1000 birds) (p = 0.03). Furthermore, most participants reported practicing hand washing but they neither used protective devices such as gloves and face masks, and >50% would not invite veterinary professionals to their farms. There was a significant association between risk perception and knowledge (p = 0.007; CI = 1.257-4.200) as well as between risk perception and prevention/control practice (p = 0.002; CI = 1.451-4.867). Conclusion: Poultry farm workers in Buea had poor knowledge and perception of ZD risk and this might have contributed to their poor prevention/control practices on the farms. Enhanced informal education of poultry farmers through training workshops and seminars will improve their knowledge and skills on ZD transmission risk and prevention. Copyright: © Bissong, et al.

AB  - Hantavirus Cardiopulmonary Syndrome (HCPS) is a disease with high human lethality rates, whose transmission risk is directly related to the abundance of reservoir rodents. In the Brazilian Atlantic forest, the main reservoirs species, Oligoryzomys nigripes and Necromys lasiurus, are thought to increase in abundance with deforestation. Therefore, forest restoration may contribute to decrease HCPS transmission risk, a topic still unexplored, especially in tropical regions. Aiming at filling this research gap, we quantified the potential of forest restoration, as required by the current environmental legislation, to reduce the abundance of Hantavirus reservoir rodents in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Using a dataset on small mammal communities sampled at 104 sites, we modeled how the abundance of these two rodent species change with the percentage of forest cover and forest edge density. From the best model, we extrapolated rodent abundance to the entire Atlantic Forest, considering two scenarios: current and restored forest cover. Comparing the estimated abundance between these two scenarios, we show that forest restoration can reduce the abundance of O. nigripes up to 89.29% in 43.43% of Atlantic forest territory. For N. lasiurus, abundance decreased up to 46% in 44% of the Atlantic forest. To our knowledge, this is the first study linking forest restoration and zoonotic diseases. Our results indicate that forest restoration would decrease the chance of HCPS transmission in ~45% of the Atlantic forest, making the landscape healthier to ~2,8 million people living within this area. This positive effect of restoration on disease regulation should be considered as an additional argument to encourage and promote forest restoration in tropical areas around the world. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Increasing frequency of zoonotic diseases put the human populations in and around the biodiversity-rich tropical forests under constant risk of epidemic outbreak. However, an integrated strategy for awareness and development and real-time data gathering from among the susceptible localities are wanting.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has caused global disruption, with the emergence of this and other pandemics having been linked to habitat encroachment and/or wildlife exploitation. High impacts of COVID-19 are apparent in some countries with large tropical peatland areas, some of which are relatively poorly resourced to tackle disease pandemics. Despite this, no previous investigation has considered tropical peatlands in the context of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs). Here, we review: (i) the potential for future EIDs arising from tropical peatlands; (ii) potential threats to tropical peatland conservation and local communities from COVID-19; and (iii) potential steps to help mitigate these risks. We find that high biodiversity in tropical peat-swamp forests, including presence of many potential vertebrate and invertebrate vectors, combined, in places, with high levels of habitat disruption and wildlife harvesting represent suitable conditions for potential zoonotic EID (re-) emergence. Although impossible to predict precisely, we identify numerous potential threats to tropical peatland conservation and local communities from the COVID-19 pandemic. This includes impacts on public health, with the potential for haze pollution from peatland fires to increase COVID-19 susceptibility a noted concern; and on local economies, livelihoods and food security, where impacts will likely be greater in remote communities with limited/no medical facilities that depend heavily on external trade. Research, training, education, conservation and restoration activities are also being affected, particularly those involving physical groupings and international travel, some of which may result in increased habitat encroachment, wildlife harvesting or fire, and may therefore precipitate longer-term negative impacts, including those relating to disease pandemics. We conclude that sustainable management of tropical peatlands and their wildlife is important for mitigating impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, and reducing the potential for future zoonotic EID emergence and severity, thus strengthening arguments for their conservation and restoration. To support this, we list seven specific recommendations relating to sustainable management of tropical peatlands in the context of COVID-19/disease pandemics, plus mitigating the current impacts of COVID-19 and reducing potential future zoonotic EID risk in these localities. Our discussion and many of the issues raised should also be relevant for non-tropical peatland areas and in relation to other (pandemic-related) sudden socio-economic shocks that may occur in future.

AB  - Some of the climate-sensitive infections (CSIs) affecting humans are zoonotic vector-borne diseases, such as Lyme borreliosis (BOR) and tick-borne encephalitis (TBE), mostly linked to various species of ticks as vectors. Due to climate change, the geographical distribution of tick species, their hosts, and the prevalence of pathogens are likely to change. A recent increase in human incidences of these CSIs in the Nordic regions might indicate an expansion of the range of ticks and hosts, with vegetation changes acting as potential predictors linked to habitat suitability. In this paper, we study districts in Fennoscandia and Russia where incidences of BOR and TBE have steadily increased over the 1995–2015 period (defined as ’Well Increasing districts’). This selection is taken as a proxy for increasing the prevalence of tick-borne pathogens due to increased habitat suitability for ticks and hosts, thus simplifying the multiple factors that explain incidence variations. This approach allows vegetation types and strengths of correlation specific to the WI districts to be differentiated and compared with associations found over all districts. Land cover types and their changes found to be associated with increasing human disease incidence are described, indicating zones with potential future higher risk of these diseases. Combining vegetation cover and climate variables in regression models shows the interplay of biotic and abiotic factors linked to CSI incidences and identifies some differences between BOR and TBE. Regression model projections up until 2070 under different climate scenarios depict possible CSI progressions within the studied area and are consistent with the observed changes over the past 20 years. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Introduction: Zoonotic transmission is a challenge for the control and elimination of malaria. It has been recorded in the Atlantic Forest, outside the Amazon which is the endemic region in Brazil. However, only very few studies have assessed the antibody response, especially of IgM antibodies, in Neotropical primates (NP). Therefore, in order to contribute to a better understanding of the immune response in different hosts and facilitate the identification of potential reservoirs, in this study, naturally acquired IgM antibody responses against Plasmodium antigens were evaluated, for the first time, in NP from the Atlantic Forest. Methods: The study was carried out using 154 NP samples from three different areas of the Atlantic Forest. IgM antibodies against peptides of the circumsporozoite protein (CSP) from different Plasmodium species and different erythrocytic stage antigens were detected by ELISA. Results: Fifty-nine percent of NP had IgM antibodies against at least one CSP peptide and 87% against at least one Plasmodium vivax erythrocytic stage antigen. Levels of antibodies against PvAMA-1 were the highest compared to the other antigens. All families of NP showed IgM antibodies against CSP peptides, and, most strikingly, against erythrocytic stage antigens. Generalized linear models demonstrated that IgM positivity against PvCSP and PvAMA-1 was associated with PCR-detectable blood-stage malaria infection and the host being free-living. Interestingly, animals with IgM against both PvCSP and PvAMA-1 were 4.7 times more likely to be PCR positive than animals that did not have IgM for these two antigens simultaneously. Discussion: IgM antibodies against different Plasmodium spp. antigens are present in NP from the Atlantic Forest. High seroprevalence and antibody levels against blood-stage antigens were observed, which had a significant association with molecular evidence of infection. IgM antibodies against CSP and AMA-1 may be used as a potential marker for the identification of NP infected with Plasmodium, which are reservoirs of malaria in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest.

AB  - The intense process of deforestation in tropical forests poses serious challenges for the survival of biodiversity, as well as for the human species itself. This scenario is supported by the increase in the incidence of epidemics of zoonotic origin observed over the last few decades. In the specific case of sylvatic yellow fever (YF), it has already been shown that an increase in the transmission risk of the causative agent (yellow fever virus - YFV) is associated with areas with a high degree of forest fragmentation, which can facilitate the spread of the virus. In this study we tested the hypothesis that areas with more fragmented landscapes and a higher edge density (ED) but a high degree of connectivity between forest patches favor YFV spread. To this end, we used YF epizootics in non-human primates (NHPs) in the state of São Paulo to build direct networks, and used a multi-selection approach to analyze which landscape features could facilitate YFV spread. Our results showed that municipalities with the potential to spread the virus exhibited a higher amount of forest edge. Additionally, the models with greater empirical support showed a strong association between forest edge density and the risk of occurrence of epizootic diseases, as well as the need for a minimum threshold of native vegetation cover to restrict their transmission. These findings corroborate our hypothesis that more fragmented landscapes with a higher degree of connectivity favor the spread of YFV, while landscapes with fewer connections tend to act as dead zones for the circulation of the virus. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Today, education for sustainable development (ESD) is a priority area of education in all countries. School geography, which comprehensively studies the "nature - population - economy" system, plays an exceptional role in implementing the ideas of ESD. The course "Economic and Social Geography of the World" in upper secondary school completes the cycle of school geography education and is designed to form students' understanding of the main trends and processes taking place in the world. In 2020, the world is facing an unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic. Coping with the current health emergency is an urgent global priority at this stage, but in the long term, action must be taken to address the root causes of the pandemic. One of these root causes is the degradation and reduction of forest area, which disrupts the natural balance and exacerbates the risk of transmission of zoonotic disease from wildlife to humans. The main result of this research is the inclusion of new cartographic plots that address the topic of biodiversity conservation and sustainable use of the world's forest resources in the content of the school atlas "Economic and Social Geography of the World. Natural resources. Population. Economy". The World maps that have been developed include "Forest resources" (1: 160,000,000), "Reduction of forest area" (1: 250,000,000), "Timber industry" (1: 160,000,000). In addition, the map "Land cover" (1: 80,000,000) shows forests and woodlands, and the map "Pollution and disturbance of the lithosphere and biosphere" (1: 160,000,000) shows the areas of preserved and cut down tropical rainforests. For the first time the topic of biodiversity conservation is presented in Russian school atlases. Two world maps are dedicated to it - "Biodiversity" (1: 160,000,000) and "Biodiversity Loss" (1: 250,000,000). Forest ecosystems are one of the most important components of the Earth's biodiversity. The inclusion of new maps developed from the standpoint of sustainable development in the content of the school atlas helps to develop students' ability to understand global issues and motivates to take part in solving them. © 2021 Lomonosov Moscow State University.

AB  - Introduction Plasmodium knowlesi malaria is a zoonotic mosquito-borne disease with complex epidemiology. According to the WHO, the prevention and control of vector-borne diseases require community participation to increase coherence between malaria interventions and sustainable public health programmes. We describe a participatory research (PR) design for a study aimed at exploring the key anthropological drivers of and barriers to zoonotic malaria preventive behaviour among communities exposed to P. knowlesi infection in Malaysia. Participatory approaches can facilitate policymakers in designing future zoonotic malaria control programmes by investigating community perspectives and concerns about zoonotic malaria in a local context. Methods and analysis The PR will be conducted over a period of 12 months, from March 2022 to March 2023, among adults (>18 years old) who are permanent residents in a rural village exposed to P. knowlesi malaria in Sabah, Malaysia. We will select patients who were diagnosed with P. knowlesi infection from January to December 2021 for focus group discussions (FGDs), as they can provide perspectives on the disease from the point of view of those previously diagnosed with infection. In-depth interviews (IDIs) with people of importance in the community, such as village heads, will also be conducted. Both FGDs and IDIs will be conducted from March 2022 until June 2022. Concurrently, a photovoice with adults over 18 years old who reside in the community will be conducted. The target sample sizes for FGDs, IDIs and photovoice are 6-8, 12 and 10-15 participants, respectively. We will use a study framework as a theoretical lens to guide the exploration of the beliefs, social contexts, barriers and drivers surrounding zoonotic malaria preventive behaviour. Ethics and dissemination This study has been approved by the Medical Research and Ethics Committee Ministry of Health Malaysia (NMRR ID-21-01980-JEH) and the Research and Innovation Secretariat, Faculty of Medicine, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (FF-2021-462). All participants will provide consent prior to participation. The results will be reported in international peer-reviewed journals and presented at conferences and on other platforms.  ©

AB  - Landscape modification represents one of the most severe threats to biodiversity from local to global scales. Conversion of forest to agricultural production generally results in patches of habitat that subdivide or isolate populations, alter the behavior of species, modify interspecific interactions, reduce biodiversity, and compromise ecosystem processes. Moreover, conversion may increase exposure of humans to zoonoses to which they would otherwise rarely be exposed. We evaluated the effects of forest conversion to agriculture, and its subsequent successional dynamics, on bat communities in a region of the Amazon that was predominantly closed-canopy rainforest. Based on a nonmanipulative experiment, we quantified differences in species composition, community structure, and taxonomic biodiversity among closed-canopy forest (bosque), agricultural lands (chacra), and secondary forest (purma) for two phyllostomid guilds (frugivores and gleaning animalivores) during the wet and dry seasons. Responses were complex and guild-specific. For frugivores, species composition (species abundance distributions) differed between all possible pairs of habitats in both wet and dry seasons. For gleaning animalivores, species composition differed between all possible pairs of habitats in the dry season, but no differences characterized the wet season. Ecological structure (rank abundance distributions) differed among habitats in guild-specific and season-specific manners. For frugivores, mean diversity, evenness, and dominance were greater in bosque than in purma; mean dominance was greater in bosque than in chacra, but local rarity was greater in chacra than in bosque, and no differences were manifest between purma and chacra. For gleaning animalivores, mean diversity and evenness were greater in bosque than in purma, but no differences were manifest between chacra and bosque, or between purma and chacra. Such results have important implications for management, conservation, and the epidemiology of zoonotic diseases. © 2019 American Society of Mammalogists.

AB  - Tropical forests are under severe threat from over-hunting. Subsistence harvests and poaching have decimated wildlife populations to the extent that nearly 50% of Earth’s tropical forests are partially or fully devoid of large mammals. Declines are particularly acute in Southeast Asia where ongoing defaunation, largely attributable to indiscriminate snare trapping, is widespread. Using the extensively forested Aceh province in northern Sumatra as a case study, we document rampant snaring, which threatens Earth’s last sympatric population of tigers, rhinoceros, elephants, and orangutans. To prevent catastrophic hunting-induced impacts already experienced in mainland Southeast Asia, we call for more comprehensive conservation planning assessments that strengthen wildlife law enforcement, promote collaborative anti-poaching, and research species-specific snaring impacts, particularly in the context of human-wildlife conflict. We conclude with a discussion of the important linkages between poaching, wildlife trade, and zoonotic disease risk. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - The Organization for Tropical Studies (OTS) has played a pivotal role in our understanding of tropical ecosystems' structure and function. For more than fifty years, OTS has contributed to the training of three generations of tropical biologists and facilitated, supported, and promoted leading-edge research in its field stations. Plant reproductive ecology and genetics have been a significant focus of OTS research since the early 1960s, and Dr. K.S. Bawa made a significant contribution to the advancement of this field. His work improved our understanding of the diversity and evolution of breeding systems in tropical forests, their phenology and pollination ecology, and their mating and genetic structure. We argue that his work inspired other tropical biologists' work and used the work of one of the authors for illustration when appropriate. We point out the need for research in critically important topics to slow down biodiversity loss, prevent the collapse of tropical systems in a changing climate, and the emergence of zoonotic disease. We suggest future research topics for the OTS field stations, including in plant reproductive biology. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A debate has emerged over the potential socio-ecological drivers of wildlife-origin zoonotic disease outbreaks and emerging infectious disease (EID) events. This Review explores the extent to which the incidence of wildlife-origin infectious disease outbreaks, which are likely to include devastating pandemics like HIV/AIDS and COVID-19, may be linked to excessive and increasing rates of tropical deforestation for agricultural food production and wild meat hunting and trade, which are further related to contemporary ecological crises such as global warming and mass species extinction. Here we explore a set of precautionary responses to wildlife-origin zoonosis threat, including: (a) limiting human encroachment into tropical wildlands by promoting a global transition to diets low in livestock source foods; (b) containing tropical wild meat hunting and trade by curbing urban wild meat demand, while securing access for indigenous people and local communities in remote subsistence areas; and (c) improving biosecurity and other strategies to break zoonosis transmission pathways at the wildlife-human interface and along animal source food supply chains. © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - Yellow fever is a zoonotic arbovirosis, the agent of which is transmitted by mosquitoes. In humans, this virus can cause hemorrhagic hepato-nephritis, while mild or inapparent infections are common. The catastrophic epidemics that occurred, mainly in the 18th and the 19th centuries, in Latin America and the United States as well as in the port cities of West Africa and Europe, had considerable demographic, socio-economic and political repercussions. The viral nature of the infectious agent and its transmission by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, previously suspected by Beauperthuy, were demonstrated by Carlos Finlay in 1881 and confirmed by the American Commission led by Walter Reed in Havana in 1900 and by the French Commission led by Emile Marchoux in Rio de Janeiro in 1901-1905. The control of Ae. aegypti could then be implemented effectively. It was only in 1927 that the yellow fever virus was isolated in Africa, its continent of origin, by French researchers from the Pasteur Institute in Dakar and by the American and English teams of the Rockefeller Foundation. Soon after, epidemiologists realized that there were forest cycles of the virus, involving monkeys and vectors other than Ae. aegypti, and consequently recognized the existence of a wild reservoir of the virus. Once the virus was isolated, work on vaccine development could begin. This research was carried out by the Institut Pasteur in Dakar and by the Rockefeller Foundation. The two teams succeeded in obtaining two live vaccines conferring excellent and long-lasting protection: the neurotropic "Dakar" vaccine (1934) and the "Rockefeller" 17D vaccine (1937), which was better tolerated. From then on, the fight against of yellow fever involved entomological control and vaccine protection, and it was a huge success until the 1960s. Unfortunately, the control programs were gradually reduced, and in some countries terminated. This resulted in the return of Ae. aegypti in urban areas and in insufficient vaccination coverage. Risks of epidemics reappeared, in Latin America as well as Africa. In the early 21st century, epidemiologists are worried about these resurgences, especially since we still have no indisputable explanation for the absence of the disease on the Asian continent. Obviously, yellow fever is not a disease of the past. © 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS

AB  - The COVID-19 virus is a zoonotic disease, an infectious disease caused by a pathogen (an infectious agent, such as a bacterium, virus, parasite or prion) that has jumped from an animal (usually a vertebrate) to a human. It was declared a pandemic by World Health Organization (WHO) on January 30, 2020. The COVID-19 virus is also a zooanthroponosis, that can be transmitted from human to animals. Malaysia has seven wild cats' species and five mustelids which can be found in the forests of Peninsular Malaysia as well as in captivity, in zoos and conservation facilities. Human beings have the potential to spread the COVID-19 virus to wild mustelids and big cat species, which may threaten its populations in Peninsular Malaysia. The authorities must respond swiftly during the zoonotic phase and post-zoonotic contingency phase, with stringent policies and guidelines to control the spread of the disease into natural forest habitats that may threaten the mustelids and cat populations. © 2021 Penerbit UMT.

AB  - Human malaria due to zoonotic transmission has been recorded in the Atlantic Forest, an extra-Amazonian area in Brazil, which are a challenge for malaria control. Naturally acquired humoral immune response against pre-erythrocytic and erythrocytic antigens of Neotropical primates (NP) was evaluated here to improve the knowledge about the exposure of those animals to the malaria transmission and support the identification of the potential reservoirs of the disease in the Atlantic Forest. Blood samples of 154 monkeys from three areas of the Atlantic Forest were used to identify IgG antibodies against peptides of the repeat region of the major pre-erythrocytic antigen, the circumsporozoite protein (CSP), of Plasmodium vivax (PvCSP), Plasmodium brasilianum/Plasmodium malariae (Pb/PmCSP), and Plasmodium falciparum (PfCSP) by ELISA. Antibodies against erythrocytic recombinant antigens of P. vivax, Apical membrane antigen 1 (PvAMA-1), Erythrocyte binding protein 2 (PvEBP-2) and domain II of Duffy binding protein (PvDBPII) were also evaluated. Parameters, such as age, sex, PCR positivity, and captivity, potentially associated with humoral immune response were analyzed. Eighty-five percent of NP had antibodies against at least one CSP peptide, and 76% against at least one P. vivax erythrocytic antigen. A high percentage of adults compared to non-adults were seropositive and showed increased antibody levels. Neotropical primates with PCR positive for P. simium had a significantly higher frequency of positivity rate for immune response against PvEBP-2, PvDBPII and also higher antibody levels against PvDBPII, compared to PCR negative NPs for this species. Monkeys with PCR positive for P. brasilianum/P. malariae showed higher frequency of seropositivity and antibody levels against Pb/PmCSP. Levels of antibodies against Pb/PmCSP, PvEBP-2 and PvDBPII were higher in free-living than in captive monkeys from the same area. All Platyrrhine families showed antibodies against CSP peptides, however not all showed IgG against erythrocytic antigens. These findings showed a high prevalence of naturally acquired antibodies against CSP repeats in all studied areas, suggesting an intense exposure to infected-mosquitoes bites of NP from all families. However, mainly monkeys of Atelidae family showed antibodies against P. vivax erythrocytic antigens, suggesting blood infection, which might serve as potential reservoirs of malaria in the Atlantic Forest. © Copyright © 2021 Assis, Alvarenga, Costa Pereira, Sánchez-Arcila, de Pina Costa, Souza Junior, Nunes, Pissinatti, Moreira, de Menezes Torres, Costa, da Penha Tinoco, Pereira, Soares, Sousa, Ntumngia, Adams, Kano, Hirano, Daniel-Ribeiro, Oliveira Ferreira, Carvalho and Alves de Brito.

AB  - Howler monkey capture is an arduous and expensive task requiring trained and specialized professionals. We compared strategies and methods to most efficiently capture Alouatta guariba clamitans in remnants of the Atlantic Forest in Rio de Janeiro and its bordering states of Minas Gerais and São Paulo. We tested whether or not the success of expeditions in the forest with anesthetic darts, nets, and baited traps differed with and without the support of an information network, a contact chain built with key institutions and inhabitants to continuously monitor howler monkey presence. The influence of forest conditions (vegetation type and fragment size) upon darting success was also evaluated. We captured 24 free-living A. guariba clamitans. No howler monkey was caught with traps, probably due to the predominantly folivore feeding to high local plant diversity providing a great variety of food options. Captures based on an information network were significantly more efficient in terms of numbers of caught monkeys than without it. Captures with darts were considerably more efficient when performed in semideciduous forests and small forest fragments as opposed to ombrophilous forests or large woods. Although we walked great distances within the forest searching for howler monkeys, all but one animal were captured at the forest fringes. Hindrances to search and the darting method in the Atlantic Forest, for example, the steep terrain, high tree canopies, hunt pressure, and low A. guariba clamitans population density, were mitigated with the use of the information network in this monkey capture. Moreover, the information network enhanced the surveillance of zoonotic diseases, which howler monkeys and other nonhuman primates are reservoirs in Brazil, such as malaria and yellow fever. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Currently, human being activities have impaired ecosystem´s resistance capacity to ecological disturbances at global scale. Human impact during the last century has caused an unprecedent rate of transformation of temperate and tropical forest at different scales, mainly due to deforestation. Humanity´s exponential population growth rate and dramatic social inequity represent important challenges for achieving sustainability goals, given increased and uneven use of resources. In addition, land use change increases the population´s risk to be affected by zoonotic emergent disease in tropical and temperate regions, which represents a public held issue. Therefore, landscape connectivity plays a key role not only in biodiversity conservation and maintenance of ecological functions, making the development of tools for land analysis and land use planning. This would allow the restoration of ecosystems, the creation of ecological corridors mainly for the protection of larger wildlife, as well as reducing the potential risk of zoonoses and the development of multidisciplinary studies. © 2021 Los Autores.

AB  - Alveolar echinococcosis (AE) is a chronic zoonotic disease caused by the larval form of Echinococcus multilocularis. In humans, it may become a serious chronic infection of the liver which resembles a slow malignant process leading to death when untreated. The aim of the study was an assessment of the risk factors of the E. multilocularis infections and the description of AE clinical course in the group of 36 patients with confirmed AE, hospitalized at the Department and Clinic of Tropical and Parasitic Diseases, Poznan University of Medical Sciences between 2013 and 2022. Among the study participants, most patients cultivated land, bred livestock, worked in the forest, or were employed in animal shelters. The E. multilocularis infection was diagnosed based on imaging and immunoassay techniques within 6 months in the majority of patients hospitalized in the Department. All patients hospitalized in the Department initiated anti-parasitic therapy at the moment of the diagnosis. Pharmacological treatment combined with surgery was applied in most of the study participants, who were presented with more advanced stages of infection. We conclude the following: 1. For humans in the risk group, regular abdominal imaging examinations and the detection of specific antibodies against E. multilocularis are recommended. 2. Regular screening tests in the hyperendemic areas of AE would increase the early detection of the disease and to improve the clinical prognosis in this extremely life-threatening parasitic disease. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a re-emerging zoonotic disease of domestic ruminants and humans. While neighbouring countries have reported outbreaks of RVF, Ghana has not yet identified any cases. The aim of this study was to determine whether RVF virus (RVFV) was circulating in livestock and herders in the southern part of Ghana, to estimate its seroprevalence, and to identify associated risk factors. The study surveyed 165 livestock farms randomly selected from two districts in southern Ghana. Serum samples of 253 goats, 246 sheep, 220 cattle, and 157 herdsmen were tested to detect IgG and IgM antibodies against RVFV. The overall seroprevalence of anti-RVF antibodies in livestock was 13.1% and 30.9% of farms had RVFV seropositive animals. The species-specific prevalence was 24.1% in cattle, 8.5% in sheep, and 7.9% in goats. A RVFV IgG seroprevalence of 17.8% was found among the ruminant herders, with 8.3% of all herders being IgM positive. RVFV was shown, for the first time, to have been circulating in southern Ghana, with evidence of a recent outbreak in Kwahu East; however, it was clinically undetected despite significant recent human exposure. A One Health approach is recommended to better understand RVF epidemiology and socio-economic impact in Ghana. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Echinococcosis is a parasitic zoonosis that is considered as a neglected disease by the World Health Organization. The species Echinococcus oligarthrus is one of the causative agents of Neotropical echinococcosis, which is a poorly understood disease that requires a complex medical examination, may threaten human life, and is frequently associated with a low socioeconomic status. Morphological and genetic diversity in E. oligarthrus remains unknown. The aim of this work is to identify and characterize E. oligarthrus infections in sylvatic animals from the Upper Paraná Atlantic Forest in the province of Misiones, Argentina, by following an integrative approach that links morphological, genetic and ecological aspects. This study demonstrates, for the first time, one of the complete life cycles of E. oligarthrus in an important ecoregion. The Upper Paraná Atlantic Forest constitutes the largest remnant continuous forest of the Atlantic Forest, representing 7% of the world's biodiversity. This is the first molecular determination of E. oligarthrus in Argentina. In addition, the agouti (Dasyprocta azarae), the ocelot (Leopardus pardalis) and the puma (Puma concolor) were identified as sylvatic hosts of Neotropical echinococcosis caused by E. oligarthrus. Mitochondrial and nuclear molecular marker analyses showed a high genetic diversity in E. oligarthrus. Moreover, the genetic distance found among E. oligarthrus isolates is higher than the one observed among Echinococcus granulosus genotypes, which clearly indicates that there are at least two different E. oligarthrus populations in Argentina. This study provides valuable information to understand the underlying conditions that favour the maintenance of E. oligarthrus in sylvatic cycles and to evaluate its zoonotic significance for devising preventive measures for human and animal wellbeing. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Accurate prediction of zoonotic spillover events requires a detailed understanding of baseline pathogens circulating in differing global environments. By characterizing the diversity and determining the natural baseline of pathogens in a given biological system, any perturbations to this balance can be detected, leading to estimates of risk for emerging diseases. As epidemics and probability for pandemics increase, there is a fundamental need for building global collaborations to fill gaps in the surveillance effort, especially to build remote in-county capacity and standardize timely sample processing and data analysis. To this point, a new consortium, the Remote Emerging Disease Intelligence-NETwork (REDI-NET) has been established to enhance surveillance approaches and characterize natural pathogens in temperate, tropical forest, and tropical grassland biomes. The REDI-NET is envisioned to be a long-term, phased initiative. All phases will integrate accompanying training resources such as videos reflecting SOPs and Quick Reference Guides. Routine bio- and xenosurveillance will facilitate the characterization of ecological parameters, enhance the accuracy of vector species identification using artificial intelligence technology, and guide the establishment of epidemiological risk thresholds critical for mitigating disease outbreaks in a timely manner. A key deliverable of the REDI-NET is a custom-designed electronically merged (e-MERGE) data pipeline and alert dashboard that integrates remotely captured data with state-of-the-art metagenomic next-generation sequencing technology. This pipeline incorporates data generated from field and laboratory best practices, to furnish health decision-makers with a centralized, timely, and rigorous database to efficiently search interdisciplinary and heterogeneous data sources necessary to alert, prepare and mitigate health threats. The e-MERGE pipeline, once fully established, will be a flexible, scalable, and expandable tool for varied health applications. Program success will result in an operational framework that addresses resource gaps in pathogen surveillance and enhances health protection with broad global applicability. The objective of this manuscript is to introduce the REDI-NET framework to anticipated stakeholders engaged in metagenomics, epidemiological surveillance, and One Health with a focus on Phase 1.

AB  - Tropical forests have the greatest biodiversity in macroorganisms on the planet, and they are also the richest in myriads of microorganisms for which so little is known today. Over the last 50 years, many of these microbial forms, that are naturally embedded into wildlife or the environment, e.g. soil, water, have revealed to be more or less dangerous pathogens for people exposed to these new natural threats, i.e. emerging infectious diseases. Here, we discuss about the extraordinary diversity of microorganisms that are present in tropical rainforests. We first present the main global distribution patterns for microbial forms at the interface between tropical wildlife and human, and second we provide an epidemiological picture on how microbial transmission from wild animals or the environment to people operates in tropical areas through four case-studies. We examine the animal hosts or environment, and transmission mechanisms involved in spillover of zoonotic or environmentally-persistent microbes, and identify land-use changes through deforestation for the development of agriculture, and contacts with wildlife notably through bush meat hunting as major drivers that facilitate mixing of diverse animal hosts and their microbial communities with human during practices. With an increase of deforestation in the tropics and more contacts between wildlife and people, new emerging disease events with high epidemic and pandemic potential will happen, that should guide new health policies and strategies at the global scale. © S.F.S.P..

Ces 50 dernières années, certains de ces microorganismes, à l’origine présents chez des animaux forestiers ou hébergés dans l’environnement comme le sol ou l’eau, se sont dévoilés être des agents pathogènes plus ou moins sévères pour les populations humaines exposées. Dans cet article, nous discutons des interactions hôtes-microorganismes rencontrées dans les forêts primaires en les abordant tant d’un angle macroécologique que d’un point de vue plus fonctionnel, en l’illustrant de quatre exemples d’agents microbiens émergents. Plus que tout autre déterminant, les modifications d’usages des sols, notamment au travers de la déforestation pour le développement d’une agriculture, et les contacts avec les microorganismes via la biodiversité, particulièrement lors de la pratique de chasse, exposent des individus susceptibles à ces nouveaux dangers microbiens. Avec la déforestation et des expositions croissantes avec la faune sauvage, le risque de nouvelles infections humaines devient une réalité internationale exigeant de la part des autorités publiques de mieux prendre en considération ces éléments pour la sécurité sanitaire mondiale. © S.F.S.P..

AB  - The risk of spillover of zoonotic diseases to humans is changing in response to multiple environmental and societal drivers, particularly in tropical regions where the burden of neglected zoonotic diseases is highest and land use change and forest conversion is occurring most rapidly. Neglected zoonotic diseases can have significant impacts on poor and marginalised populations in low-resource settings but ultimately receive less attention and funding for research and interventions. As such, effective control measures and interventions are often hindered by a limited ecological evidence base, which results in a limited understanding of epidemiologically relevant hosts or vectors and the processes that contribute to the maintenance of pathogens and spillover to humans. Here, we develop a generalisable next genera-tion matrix modelling framework to better understand the transmission processes and hosts that have the greatest contribution to the maintenance of tick-borne diseases with the aim of improving the ecological evidence base and framing future research priorities for tick-borne diseases. Using this model we explore the relative contribution of different host groups and transmission routes to the maintenance of a neglected zoonotic tick-borne disease, Kyasa-nur Forest Disease Virus (KFD), in multiple habitat types. The results highlight the potential importance of transovarial transmission and small mammals and birds in maintaining this disease. This contradicts previous hypotheses that primates play an important role influenc-ing the distribution of infected ticks. There is also a suggestion that risk could vary across different habitat types but currently more research is needed to evaluate this relationship. In light of these results, we outline the key knowledge gaps for this system and future research priorities that could inform effective interventions and control measures. © 2023 Hassall et al.

AB  - In 1964, Brucella was isolated from rodents trapped in Wooroonooran National Park (WNP), in Northern Queensland, Australia. Genotyping of bacterial isolates in 2008 determined that they were a novel Brucella species. This study attempted to reisolate this species of Brucella from rodents living in the boundary area adjacent to WNP and to establish which endo- and ecto-parasites and bacterial agents were being carried by non-indigenous rodents at this interface. Seventy non-indigenous rodents were trapped [Mus musculus (52), Rattus rattus (17) and Rattus norvegicus (1)], euthanized and sampled on four properties adjacent to the WNP in July 2012. Organ pools were screened by culture for Salmonella, Leptospira and Brucella species, real-time PCR for Coxiella burnetii and conventional PCR for Leptospira. Collected ecto- and endo-parasites were identified using morphological criteria. The percentage of rodents carrying pathogens were Leptospira (40%), Salmonella choleraesuis ssp. arizonae (14.29%), ectoparasites (21.42%) and endoparasites (87%). Brucella and C. burnetii were not identified, and it was concluded that their prevalences were below 12%. Two rodent-specific helminthic species, namely Syphacia obvelata (2.86%) and Nippostrongylus brasiliensis (85.71%), were identified. The most prevalent ectoparasites belonged to Laelaps spp. (41.17%) followed by Polyplax spp. (23.53%), Hoplopleura spp. (17.65%), Ixodes holocyclus (17.64%) and Stephanocircus harrisoni (5.88%), respectively. These ectoparasites, except S. harrisoni, are known to transmit zoonotic pathogens such as Rickettsia spp. from rat to rat and could be transmitted to humans by other arthropods that bite humans. The high prevalence of pathogenic Leptospira species is of significant public health concern. This is the first known study of zoonotic agents carried by non-indigenous rodents living in the Australian wet-tropical forest interface. © 2015 Blackwell Verlag GmbH

AB  - The Farasan archipelago - like its African counterpart, the Dahlak Archipelago - is a unique assembly of coral-formed islands located on the Farasan Bank at the Arabian site of the southern Red Sea. The rugged surface and the tropical-arid climate form a harsh landscape in which only a few mammal species have managed to survive. This chapter presents a short overview about the mammal fauna of the Farasan archipelago - comprising only two bat species, one carnivore, one ungulate and two rodent species - and subsequently provides an in-depth insight into the ecology of 'idmi', the Arabian gazelle (Gazella arabica), on the Farasan Islands. The archipelago has been protected since 1988, primarily to preserve its Arabian gazelle population, but also for its exceptional conservation value as a marine reserve. The protected area harbours probably the largest population of Arabian gazelles worldwide and represents a phylogenetically distinct population diluted by repeated introductions of mainland Arabian gazelles. After discussing the phylogeny, taxonomy and a putative island dwarfism of the gazelle population, the chapter reports on habitat preferences and the limiting resources. Most recent research on population structure, social organization and population development is summarized and related to the conservation of the gazelles in the Farasan Islands Protected Area. Since competition with livestock and the transmission of zoonotic diseases pose eminent threats to the survival of the population, the interface between domestic animals and the gazelles is highlighted. Finally, the chapter shades some light on the phylogeny and taxonomy of other island dwelling gazelles in Arabian waters. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.

AB  - Leptospirosis is an emerging infectious zoonotic disease caused by pathogenic Leptospira. The disease is more prevalent among farmers in hot and humid areas of Iran. Lack of clear clinical signs have impeded the diagnosis of leptospirosis. In this study, we attempted to produce a recombinant LipL21 protein of Leptospira based on a dominant pattern of Iranian isolates and to evaluate it in ELISA test. One hundred and sixty-two complete sequences of LipL21 available in GenBank until January 1, 2019 were compared. One dominant LipL21 protein pattern was selected. The codon optimised se-quence was cloned into the pET32a+ expression vector. Trx-LipL21 fusion protein was induced, purified and confirmed by 10% SDS-PAGE followed Coomassie blue staining and immune blotting. For evaluation of effectiveness of rLip21 in ELISA test, 200 µg rLip21 with Montanide ISA70 adju-vant was injected subcutaneously in rabbits three times. Results showed that rLipL21 protein was highly expressed in 2YT media in presence of 0.1 mM IPTG after 16 hours incubation at 37o C. Re-combinant protein was purified 36 mg per liter using affinity batch formation method by Ni-NTA resin. ELISA with micro plate coated with 250 ng rLipL21 protein demonstrated prominently diffe-rences between test and control groups (P<0.01). The rLipL21 protein produced large amounts of antibodies in the rabbit. The protein was also able to detect high levels of antibody in animals immu-nised with Leptospira vaccine. The rLipL21 might be a good candidate for diagnosis and evaluation of antibody levels against Leptospira. © 2023, Trakia University. All rights reserved.

AB  - Human activities can increase or decrease risks of acquiring a zoonotic disease, notably by affecting the composition and abundance of hosts. This study investigated the links between land use and infectious disease risk in northeast Madagascar, where human subsistence activities and population growth are encroaching on native habitats and the associated biota. We collected new data on pathogenic Leptospira, which are bacteria maintained in small mammal reservoirs. Transmission can occur through close contact, but most fre-quently through indirect contact with water contaminated by the urine of infected hosts. The probability of infection and prevalence was compared across a gradient of natural moist evergreen forest, nearby forest fragments, flooded rice and other types of agricultural fields, and in homes in a rural village. Using these data, we tested specific hypotheses for how land use alters ecological communities and influences disease transmission. The relative abundance and proportion of exotic species was highest in the anthropogenic habitats, while the relative abundance of native species was highest in the forested habitats. Prevalence of Leptospira was significantly higher in introduced compared to endemic species. Lastly, the probability of infection with Leptospira was highest in introduced small mammal species, and lower in forest fragments compared to other habitat types. Our results highlight how human land use affects the small mammal community composition and in turn disease dynamics. Introduced species likely transmit Leptospira to native species where they co-occur, and may displace the Leptospira species naturally occurring in Madagascar. The fre-quent spatial overlap of people and introduced species likely also has consequences for public health. © 2020 Herrera et al.

AB  - Zoonotic diseases affect resource-poor tropical communities disproportionately, and are linked to human use and modification of ecosystems. Disentangling the socio-ecological mechanisms by which ecosystem change precipitates impacts of pathogens is critical for predicting disease risk and designing effective intervention strategies. Despite the global “One Health” initiative, predictive models for tropical zoonotic diseases often focus on nar-row ranges of risk factors and are rarely scaled to intervention programs and ecosystem use. This study uses a participatory, co-production approach to address this disconnect between science, policy and implementation, by developing more informative disease models for a fatal tick-borne viral haemorrhagic disease, Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD), that is spreading across degraded forest ecosystems in India. We integrated knowledge across disciplines to identify key risk factors and needs with actors and beneficiaries across the relevant policy sectors, to understand disease patterns and develop decision support tools. Human case locations (2014–2018) and spatial machine learning quantified the relative role of risk factors, including forest cover and loss, host densities and public health access, in driving landscape-scale disease patterns in a long-affected district (Shivamogga, Karnataka State). Models combining forest metrics, livestock densities and elevation accurately predicted spatial patterns in human KFD cases (2014–2018). Consistent with suggestions that KFD is an “ecotonal” disease, landscapes at higher risk for human KFD contained diverse forest-plantation mosaics with high coverage of moist evergreen forest and plantation, high indigenous cattle density, and low coverage of dry deciduous forest. Models predicted new hotspots of outbreaks in 2019, indicating their value for spatial targeting of intervention. Co-production was vital for: gathering outbreak data that reflected locations of exposure in the landscape; better understanding contextual socio-ecological risk factors; and tailoring the spatial grain and outputs to the scale of forest use, and public health interventions. We argue this inter-disciplinary approach to risk prediction is applicable across zoonotic diseases in tropical settings. © 2020 Purse et al.

AB  - Bertiella sp., a cestode known to infect a variety of hosts, including nonhuman primates and humans, was identified in Paraguay as early as 1895, but no systematic analysis of wild primates’ gastrointestinal parasites has ever been carried out in Paraguay. Increased urbanization in southwest Paraguay has pushed the Paraguayan howler monkey (Alouatta caraya) into anthropogenic habitats, particularly in the city of Pilar (Ñeembucú department), giving rise to greater potential for zoonotic transmission between wild primates and humans. From July to December 2018, fecal samples were noninvasively collected from 48 howlers inside Pilar (urban environment), the Pilar Military Base (intermediate environment), and a ranch 27 km outside Pilar in the humid Chaco (natural environment) and analyzed for Bertiella eggs and proglottids using macro-analysis and formol-ether sedimentation. Howlers living in the urban environment had the highest rates of Bertiella infection (50% prevalence), with considerably lower infection rates in the intermediate environment (6.25% prevalence) and natural habitats (0% prevalence). A χ2 goodness-of-fit test indicated a significant difference between the three habitat types (p =.007, χ2 = 10.005, df = 2). While the habitat seems to impact the frequency of infection, Bertiella was not observed to select for other factors such as age or sex of the primate host. Here we identified a significant increase in the frequency of Bertiella infection in an urban environment, which can then be further transmitted to new hosts with more direct primate contact. Bertiella infection has already been documented in humans in Paraguay, all of which were associated with close primate contact. As howlers move into more urban habitats due to urbanization and habitat fragmentation, Bertiella could be introduced into this new ecosystem and has the potential to cause further infections in humans. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC

AB  - Background: The groundwork for malaria elimination does not currently consider the potential of Plasmodium zoonotic cycles that involve non-human primates (NHPs) in sylvatic environments. Since vivax malaria is less responsive to control measures, finding Plasmodium vivax infected NHPs adds even more concern. Methods: Both Free-living monkeys in forest fragments inside the urban area and captive monkeys from a local zoo had blood samples tested for Plasmodium species. Results: In this study, among the Neotropical monkeys tested, three (4.4%), one captive and two free-living, were found to be naturally infected by P. vivax. Conclusion: This important finding indicates that it is necessary to estimate the extent to which P. vivax NHP infection contributes to the maintenance of malaria transmission to humans. Therefore, the discussion on wildlife conservation and management must be incorporated into the malaria elimination agenda. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Gastrointestinal parasite are the most important and common infectious agents of human and animals worldwide especially in tropical areas. Humans can be infected with the parasites as zoonoses by shedding their infective stage and eggs via feces of animal reservoirs resulting in environmental contamination of food and water. In Maha Sarakham, Kosamphi forest park is an interesting area which has close interaction and coexistence between wildlife, domestic animals and humans where it is possible to transmit some zoonotic pathogens including gastrointestinal parasites among them. This study was conducted to investigate the occurrence of gastrointestinal parasites present in feces of long-tailed macaques, dogs and cattle shed on the environment in and around Kosamphi forest park. A total of 134 fecal samples collected from 3 animal species were processed to detect helminth eggs using the formalin-ethyl acetate technique. Three species of parasitic helminthes including Strongyloides spp., Trichuris spp. and hookworm’s eggs have been detected and assessed for their prevalence. Strongyloides spp., were the most common zoonotic parasite found in monkeys and cattle (52.24% and 45.71%) followed by hookworms (26.87% and 34.29%) while hookworms were the most common zoonotic parasite in dogs (31.25%) followed by Stron-gyloides spp. (25%). This study provides baseline information on potentially zoonotic gastrointestinal parasites in animal reservoirs at Kosamphi forest park and emphasizes the importance of both wildlife and domestic animals as reservoir hosts for zoonotic disease. A One Health Approach is necessary for prevention and control. © 2018, Chiang Mai University - Faculty of Veterinary Medicine. All rights reserved.

AB  - Currently, ~65% of extant primate species (ca 512 species) distributed in 91 countries in the Neotropics, mainland Africa, Madagascar, South Asia and Southeast Asia are threatened with extinction and 75% have declining populations as a result of deforestation and habitat loss resulting from increasing global market demands, and land conversion for industrial agriculture, cattle production and natural resource extraction. Other pressures that negatively impact primates are unsustainable bushmeat hunting, the illegal trade of primates as pets and as body parts, expanding road networks in previously isolated areas, zoonotic disease transmission and climate change. Here we examine current and future trends in several socio-economic factors directly or indirectly affecting primates to further our understanding of the interdependent relationship between human well-being, sustainable development, and primate population persistence. We found that between 2001 and 2018 ca 191 Mha of tropical forest (30% canopy cover) were lost as a result of human activities in the five primate range regions. Forty-six percent of this loss was in the Neotropics (Mexico, Central and South America), 30% in Southeast Asia, 21% in mainland Africa, 2% in Madagascar and 1% in South Asia. Countries with the greatest losses (ca 57% of total tree cover loss) were Brazil, Indonesia, DRC, China, and Malaysia. Together these countries harbor almost 50% of all extant primate species. In 2018, the world human population was estimated at ca 8bn people, ca 60% of which were found in primate range countries. Projections to 2050 and to 2100 indicate continued rapid growth of the human populations in these five primate range regions, with Africa surpassing all the other regions and totaling ca 4bn people by the year 2100. Socioeconomic indicators show that, compared to developed nations, most primate range countries are characterized by high levels of poverty and income inequality, low human development, low food security, high levels of corruption and weak governance. Models of Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios (SSPs) projected to 2050 and 2100 showed that whereas practices of increasing inequality (SSP4) or unconstrained growth in economic output and energy use (SSP5) are projected to have dire consequences for human well-being and primate survivorship, practices of sustainability-focused growth and equality (SSP1) are expected to have a positive effect on maintaining biodiversity, protecting environments, and improving the human condition. These results stress that improving the well-being, health, and security of the current and future human populations in primate range countries are of paramount importance if we are to move forward with effective policies to protect the world's primate species and promote biodiversity conservation.

AB  - Panstrongylus is a Neotropical taxa of 16 species, some more widespread than others, that act as vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiologic agent of Chagas disease (CD). This group is associated with mammalian reservoir niches. There are few studies of the biogeography and niche suitability of these triatomines. Using zoo-epidemiological occurrence databases, the distribution of Panstrongylus was determined based on bioclimatic modelling (DIVA GIS), parsimonious niche distribution (MAXENT), and parsimony analysis of endemic species (PAE). Through 517 records, a wide presence of P. geniculatus, P. rufotuberculatus, P. lignarius, and P. megistus was determined and recorded as frequent vectors of T. cruzi in rainforest habitats of 24–30 °C. These distributions were modeled with AUC >0.80 and <0.90, as well as with the seasonality of temperature, isothermality, and precipitation as relevant bioclimatic variables. Individual traces for each taxon in Panstrongylus—1036 records—showed widely dispersed lines for frequent vectors P. geniculatus, P. lignarius, P. rufotuberculatus, and P. megistus. Other occasional vectors showed more restricted dispersal, such as P. howardi, P. humeralis, P. lenti, P. lutzi, P. tupynambai, P. noireaiui, and P. chinai. Areas of defined environmental variation, geological change, and trans domain fluid fauna, such as the American Transition Zone and the Pacific Domain of Morrone, had the highest Panstrongylus diversity. Pan-biogeographic nodes appear to be areas of the greatest species diversity that act as corridors connecting biotopes and allowing fauna migration. Vicariance events in the geologic history of the continent need to be investigated. The geographical distribution of Panstrongylus overlapped with CD cases and Didelphis marsupialis/Dasypus novemcinctus presence, two important reservoirs in Central and South America. The information derived from the distribution of Panstrongylus provides knowledge for surveillance and vector control programs. It would increase information on the most and less relevant vector species of this zoonotic agent, for monitoring their population behavior. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Neglected tropical diseases affect the most vulnerable populations and cause chronic and debilitating disorders. Socioeconomic vulnerability is a well-known and important determinant of neglected tropical diseases. For example, poverty and sanitation could influence parasite transmission. Nevertheless, the quantitative impact of socioeconomic conditions on disease transmission risk remains poorly explored. Methods: This study investigated the role of socioeconomic variables in the predictive capacity of risk models of neglected tropical zoonoses using a decade of epidemiological data (2007–2018) from Brazil. Vector-borne diseases investigated in this study included dengue, malaria, Chagas disease, leishmaniasis, and Brazilian spotted fever, while directly-transmitted zoonotic diseases included schistosomiasis, leptospirosis, and hantaviruses. Environmental and socioeconomic predictors were combined with infectious disease data to build environmental and socioenvironmental sets of ecological niche models and their performances were compared. Results: Socioeconomic variables were found to be as important as environmental variables in influencing the estimated likelihood of disease transmission across large spatial scales. The combination of socioeconomic and environmental variables improved overall model accuracy (or predictive power) by 10% on average (P < 0.01), reaching a maximum of 18% in the case of dengue fever. Gross domestic product was the most important socioeconomic variable (37% relative variable importance, all individual models exhibited P < 0.00), showing a decreasing relationship with disease indicating poverty as a major factor for disease transmission. Loss of natural vegetation cover between 2008 and 2018 was the most important environmental variable (42% relative variable importance, P < 0.05) among environmental models, exhibiting a decreasing relationship with disease probability, showing that these diseases are especially prevalent in areas where natural ecosystem destruction is on its initial stages and lower when ecosystem destruction is on more advanced stages. Conclusions: Destruction of natural ecosystems coupled with low income explain macro-scale neglected tropical and zoonotic disease probability in Brazil. Addition of socioeconomic variables improves transmission risk forecasts on tandem with environmental variables. Our results highlight that to efficiently address neglected tropical diseases, public health strategies must target both reduction of poverty and cessation of destruction of natural forests and savannas. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Yellow Fever Virus (YFV) reemergence in Brazil was followed by human suffering and the loss of biodiversity of neotropical simians on the Atlantic coast. The underlying mechanisms were investigated with special focus on distinct landscape fragmentation thresholds in the affected municipalities. An ecological study in epidemiology is employed to assess the statistical relationship between events of YFV and forest fragmentation in municipal landscapes. Negative binomial regression model showed that highly fragmented forest cover was associated with an 85% increase of events of YFV in humans and simians (RR = 1.85, CI 95% = 1.24-2.75, p=0.003) adjusted by vaccine coverage, population size, and municipality area. Intermediate levels of forest cover combined with higher levels of forest edge densities contribute to the YFV dispersion and the exponential growth of YF cases. Strategies for forest conservation are necessary for the control and prevention of YF and other zoonotic diseases that can spillover from the fragmented forest remains to populated cities of the Brazilian Atlantic coast.  © 2021 Roberto C.

AB  - Bushmeat is not only an important source of fat, micronutrients, and macronutrients, but it also has medicinal uses. Extensive human-wildlife interactions may lead to pathogen exchange and trigger zoonotic infectious disease outbreaks such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, Ebola, and coronavirus disease 2019. In the tropics, bushmeat has become one of the most threatened resources due to widespread habitat loss and overexploitation, largely driven by increased global demand, weak governance, and lack of enforcement. Unsustainable harvesting, consumption, and production practices are common, although drivers are complex and intertwined and vary regionally, pointing to a looming rural nutrition security and wildlife conservation issue. Growing demand in fast urbanizing markets coupled with easy access fuels the illegal trade of bushmeat, medicinal products, and wildlife-based luxury goods. Although bushmeat contributes significantly to rural people's income and poverty alleviation, overharvesting impacts those who are most dependent on the forest. To balance the rural and cultural importance of bushmeat with conservation and public health priorities, strategies to safeguard tropical biodiversity, sustainable harvest of wildlife with reduced health risk for nutrition and medicine are urgently needed. © 2020 Annual Reviews Inc..

AB  - Climate change is having a substantial impact on our environment and ecosystems and has altered the way humans live, access, and utilize resources with increased risk of zoonotic infectious disease encounters. As global temperatures continue to increase, they impact on public health, migration, food security and land conflict, and as new environments become favorable, exposure to disease carrying vectors. Increased forests or natural habitat clearance for land repurposing, urbanization, road building, and water management are related to an increase in emerging vector borne parasitic diseases. The East African region remains one of the most impacted regions globally for leishmaniasis, a vector borne disease that impacts significantly on the health, wellbeing and livelihoods of affected communities and for which a lack of reporting and control interventions hinder progress toward elimination of this neglected tropical disease. As our world continues to transform, both politically and climatically, it is essential that measures are put in place to improve surveillance and disease management with implementation of control measures, including vector control, especially in low- and middle-income countries that are expected to be most impacted by changes in climate. Only through effective management, now, can we be sufficiently resilient to preventing the inevitable spread of vectors into suitable habitat and expansion of the geographical range of leishmaniasis. This review offers a current perspective on Leishmaniasis as an endemic disease in East Africa and examines the potential of the recent emergence of Leishmania infection in hitherto unaffected regions to become a public health concern if no disease management is achieved. © Copyright © 2021 Jones and Welburn.

AB  - While we might leave the COVID-19 pandemic behind, future health professionals are still confronted with another global phenomenon: the increasing pandemic of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Both issues are strongly interwoven, yet current medical education fails to address their syndemic nature accordingly. There is scientific consensus that (i) most emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic, (ii) the overexploitation of earth's resources for animal protein production (i.e., tropical deforestation) rapidly escalates human contact with unknown pathogens, and (iii) people following a healthy plant-based diet present fewer rates of NCDs as well as severe illness and mortality from COVID-19. A shift toward whole food plant-based nutrition in the general population thus holds the potential to tackle both public health threats. We are convinced that it is every physician's responsibility to care for individual, public, and global health issues; however, future health professionals are not trained and educated regarding the health potential of plants and plant-based diets. The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the urgent need for a “prevention first” approach. Therefore, in order to upgrade medical education worldwide and protect current and future human health properly, greater medical professional awareness of evidence on plant-based diets is urgently needed in classes, universities, and hospitals.

AB  - Background: Parasites from the genus Plasmodium, the aetiological agent of malaria in humans, can also infect non-human primates (NHP), increasing the potential risk of zoonotic transmission with its associated global public health concerns. In Colombia, there are no recent studies on Plasmodium spp. infecting free-ranging NHP. Thus, this study aimed to determine the diversity of Plasmodium species circulating in fragmented forests in central Colombia, both in Anopheles mosquitoes and in the four sympatric NHP in the region (Ateles hybridus, Cebus versicolor, Alouatta seniculus and Aotus griseimembra), in order to evaluate the risk of infection to humans associated with the presence of sylvatic hosts and vectors infected with Plasmodium spp. Methods: Overall, there were collected 166 fecal samples and 25 blood samples from NHP, and 442 individuals of Anopheles spp. DNA extraction, nested PCR using mitochondrial (cox3 gene) and ribosomal (18S rDNA) primers, electrophoresis and sequencing were conducted in order to identify Plasmodium spp. from the samples. Results: Plasmodium falciparum was detected in two fecal samples of Alouatta seniculus, while Plasmodium vivax/simium infected Ateles hybridus, Cebus versicolor and Alouatta seniculus. Co-infections with P. vivax/simium and Plasmodium malariae/brasilianum were found in three individuals. The highest prevalence from blood samples was found for Plasmodium malariae/brasilianum in two Alouatta seniculus while Plasmodium vivax/simium was most prevalent in fecal samples, infecting four individuals of Alouatta seniculus. Seven Anopheles species were identified in the study site: Anopheles (Anopheles) punctimacula, Anopheles (An.) malefactor, Anopheles (Nyssorhynchus) oswaldoi, Anopheles (Nys.) triannulatus, Anopheles (An.) neomaculipalpus, Anopheles (Nys.) braziliensis and Anopheles (Nys.) nuneztovari. Infection with P. vivax/simium was found in An. nuneztovari, An. neomaculipalpus, and An. triannulatus. Furthermore, An. oswaldoi and An. triannulatus were found infected with P. malariae/brasilianum. The effect of fragmentation and distance to the nearest town measured in five forests with different degrees of fragmentation was not statistically significant on the prevalence of Plasmodium in NHP, but forest fragmentation did have an effect on the Minimum Infection Rate (MIR) in Anopheles mosquitoes. Conclusions: The presence of Plasmodium spp. in NHP and Anopheles spp. in fragmented forests in Colombia has important epidemiological implications in the human-NHP interface and the associated risk of malaria transmission. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Objective: To explore possible changes in the community attributes of haematophagous insects as a function of forest disturbance. We compare the patterns of diversity and abundance, plus the behavioural responses of three epidemiologically distinct vector assemblages across sites depicting various levels of forest cover. Methods: Over a 3-year period, we sampled mosquitoes, sandflies and biting-midges in forested habitats of central Panama. We placed CDC light traps in the forest canopy and in the understorey to gather blood-seeking females. Results: We collected 168 405 adult haematophagous dipterans in total, including 26 genera and 86 species. Pristine forest settings were always more taxonomically diverse than the disturbed forest sites, confirming that disturbance has a negative impact on species richness. Species of Phlebotominae and Culicoides were mainly classified as climax (i.e. forest specialist) or disturbance-generalist, which tend to decrease in abundance along with rising levels of disturbance. In contrast, a significant portion of mosquito species, including primary and secondary disease vectors, was classified as colonists (i.e. disturbed-areas specialists), which tend to increase in numbers towards more disturbed forest habitats. At pristine forest, the most prevalent species of Phlebotominae and Culicoides partitioned the vertical niche by being active at the forest canopy or in the understorey; yet this pattern was less clear in disturbed habitats. Most mosquito species were not vertically stratified in their habitat preference. Conclusion: We posit that entomological risk and related pathogen exposure to humans is higher in pristine forest scenarios for Culicoides and Phlebotominae transmitted diseases, whereas forest disturbance poses a higher entomological risk for mosquito-borne infections. This suggests that the Dilution Effect Hypothesis (DEH) does not apply in tropical rainforests where highly abundant, yet unrecognised insect vectors and neglected zoonotic diseases occur. Comprehensive, community level entomological surveillance is, therefore, the key for predicting potential disease spill over in scenarios of pristine forest intermixed with anthropogenic habitats. We suggest that changes in forest quality should also be considered when assessing arthropod-borne disease transmission risk. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Malaysia is a heterogeneous multi-ethnic country located in South East Asia. The country has diverse landscapes with white sandy beaches, spectacular elevated plains and highlands in the interiors of Peninsular Malaysia and Borneo. Its tropical rainforest climate is home for vast number of plant and animal species. This makes Malaysia a must visit place for nature lovers. Malaysia relied on mining (gold and tin) and agricultural (rubber) in the colonial era. Now, its economic growth is driven by the petroleum, palm oil and electronics industry. Malaysia is politically stable and together with economic prosperity have contributed towards the growing population comprising of residents and, influx of labours from other countries including Indonesia, Bangladesh and Myanmar. Malaysia now hosts 32 million strong population from which an estimated of 3 million are migrants that support manpower in agricultural and electronic sectors. This book highlights the current health related issues in Malaysia including those zoonotic diseases and non-communicable diseases that are unique and common to tropical countries. Other environmental factors that have positive and negative impacts on health such as haze and medical constituents from local plants shapes the present idea. © 2021 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - The overhunting of wildlife for food and commercial gain presents a major threat to biodiversity in tropical forests and poses health risks to humans from contact with wild animals. Using a recent survey of wildlife offered at wild meat markets in Malaysia as a basis, we review the literature to determine the potential zoonotic infection risks from hunting, butchering and consuming the species offered. We also determine which taxa potentially host the highest number of pathogens and discuss the significant disease risks from traded wildlife, considering how cultural practices influence zoonotic transmission. We identify 51 zoonotic pathogens (16 viruses, 19 bacteria and 16 parasites) potentially hosted by wildlife and describe the human health risks. The Suidae and the Cervidae families potentially host the highest number of pathogens. We conclude that there are substantial gaps in our knowledge of zoonotic pathogens and recommend performing microbial food safety risk assessments to assess the hazards of wild meat consumption. Overall, there may be considerable zoonotic risks to people involved in the hunting, butchering or consumption of wild meat in Southeast Asia, and these should be considered in public health strategies. © 2017, The Author(s).

AB  - The forthcoming World Health Organization road map for neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) 2021-2030 recognises the complexity surrounding control and elimination of these 20 diseases of poverty. It emphasises the need for a paradigm shift from disease-specific interventions to holistic cross-cutting approaches coordinating with adjacent disciplines. The One Health approach exemplifies this shift, extending beyond a conventional model of zoonotic disease control to consider the interactions of human and animal health systems within their shared environment and the wider social and economic context. This approach can also promote sustainability and resilience within these systems. To achieve the global ambition on NTD elimination and control, political will, along with contextualised innovative scientific strategies, is required.  © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - In Latin America, the common vampire bat Desmodus rotundus is the primary reservoir of rabies, a zoonotic virus that kills thousands of livestock annually and causes sporadic and lethal human rabies outbreaks. The proliferation of livestock provides an abundant food resource for this obligate blood-feeding species that could alter its foraging behaviour and rabies transmission, but poor understanding of the dietary plasticity of vampire bats limits understanding of how livestock influences rabies risk. We analysed individual- and population-level foraging behaviour by applying δ13C and δ15N stable isotope analysis to hair samples from 183 vampire bats captured from nine colonies in Peru. We also assessed the isotopic distributions of realized prey by analysing blood meals extracted from engorged bats and samples collected from potential prey species. In two adjacent but contrasting areas of the Amazon with scarce and abundant livestock, we used questionnaires to evaluate the incidence of feeding on humans. Population-level isotopic signatures suggested substantial among-site variation in feeding behaviour, including reliance on livestock in some colonies and feeding on combinations of domestic and wild prey in others. Isotopic heterogeneity within bat colonies was among the largest recorded in vertebrate populations, indicating that individuals consistently fed on distinct prey resources and across distinct trophic levels. In some sites, isotopic values of realized prey spanned broad ranges, suggesting that bats with intermediate isotopic values could plausibly be dietary specialists rather than generalists. Bayesian estimates of isotopic niche width varied up to ninefold among colonies and were maximized where wildlife and livestock were present at low levels, but declined with greater availability of livestock. In the Amazon, the absence of livestock was associated with feeding on humans and wildlife. Policy implications. We provide the first insights into the foraging behaviour of vampire bats in habitats with common depredation on humans and show how vampire bat foraging may respond to land-use change. Our results demonstrate risks of rabies transmission from bats to other wildlife and are consistent with the hypothesis that introducing livestock might reduce the burden of human rabies in high-risk communities. © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - Monitoring the invasion process of the Asian tiger mosquito Aedes albopictus and its interaction with the contender Aedes aegypti, is critical to prevent and control the arthropod-borne viruses (i.e., Arboviruses) they transmit to humans. Generally, the superior ecological competitor Ae. albopictus displaces Ae. aegypti from most geographic areas, with the combining factors of biology and environment influencing the competitive outcome. Nonetheless, detailed studies asserting displacement come largely from sub-tropical areas, with relatively less effort being made in tropical environments, including no comprehensive research about Aedes biological interactions in Mesoamerica. Here, we examine contemporary and historical mosquito surveillance data to assess the role of shifting abiotic conditions in shaping the spatiotemporal distribution of competing Aedes species in the Republic of Panama. In accordance with prior studies, we show that Ae. albopictus has displaced Ae. aegypti under suboptimal wet tropical climate conditions and more vegetated environments within the southwestern Azuero Peninsula. Conversely, in the eastern Azuero Peninsula, Ae. aegypti persists with Ae. albopictus under optimal niche conditions in a dry and more seasonal tropical climate. While species displacement was stable over the course of two years, the presence of both species generally appears to fluctuate in tandem in areas of coexistence. Aedes albopictus was always more frequently found and abundant regardless of location and climatic season. The heterogenous environmental conditions of Panama shape the competitive outcome and micro-geographic distribution of Aedes mosquitoes, with potential consequences for the transmission dynamics of urban and sylvatic zoonotic diseases. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Ticks of small mammals pose a significant risk to public health but these hazards are poorly understood in the tropics due to the paucity of information on the disease ecology of ticks in these regions. Mapping and quantifying the diversity of small mammal/tick networks and the effects of habitat on these medically important systems is key to disease prevention. Singapore represents a microcosm of much of tropical Asia as it has a diverse, though poorly studied, community of ticks and small mammals. Singapore also has a range of terrestrial habitats exhibiting a gradient of degradation. Small mammals and their ticks were sampled across the island in four main habitat types (old secondary forest, young secondary forest, scrubland, urban) across 4.5 years. Four tick species were collected (Amblyomma helvolum, Dermacentor auratus, Haemaphysalis semermis, Ixodes granulatus) from 10 small mammal species. Habitat was found to have a significant effect on both the abundance and structure of tick communities on small mammals. Old secondary forest communities had the highest tick abundance, comparatively high connectance, niche overlap (among ticks), linkage density, and were the preferred habitat of the zoonotic tick I. granulatus. Therefore, future disease spillover is likely to emerge from small mammal-tick communities in old secondary forests. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH

AB  - Tropical forests are undergoing land use change in many regions of the world, including the African continent. Human populations living close to forest margins fragmented and disturbed by deforestation may be particularly exposed to zoonotic infections because of the higher likelihood for humans to be in contact with disease reservoirs. Quantitative analysis of the nexus between deforestation and the emergence of Ebola virus disease (EVD), however, is still missing. Here we use land cover change data in conjunction with EVD outbreak records to investigate the association between recent (2004-2014) outbreaks in West and Central Africa, and patterns of land use change in the region. We show how in these EVD outbreaks the index cases in humans (i.e. spillover from wildlife reservoirs) occurred mostly in hotspots of forest fragmentation. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Ticks are important vectors of many pathogens that have contributed to the morbidity and mortality of humans and domestic animals worldwide. Wildlife species have also been implicated as reservoir hosts of a variety of tick-borne pathogens. The objective of this study was to determine which tick-transmitted pathogens were present in the animals harvested from the forest in Trinidad for human consumption. Methods: Thin blood smears from 43 neotropical animals were examined microscopically for tick-borne pathogens. Additionally, DNA extraction and PCR amplification of the 16S rRNA gene were used for amplification of Anaplasma and Ehrlichia while the gltA gene was used for Bartonella, and Rickettsia spp. and the 18S rRNA gene for Babesia, Hepatozoon and Theileria species. Results: Pathogen DNA was amplified from four samples (a deer, collared peccary and two agoutis). Sequencing of the amplified products from the deer and collared peccary revealed 99.8% homology to Anaplasma bovis and 98.8% homology to Ehrlichia canis, respectively. Sequences from two agoutis revealed 90.4% homology to Theileria spp. DNA of Hepatozoon spp., Bartonella spp. Babesia spp. and Rickettsia spp. was not detected in any of the screened samples. An incidental finding in this study was the presence of bacteria in the blood of animals. Conclusions: The results indicate that the DNA of tick-transmitted pathogens is present at a frequency of about 10% in the study population and suggests that neotropical mammals may serve as a source for the potential transmission of tick-borne pathogens to domestic animals and humans. In addition, physicians and hunters should be aware of the symptoms associated with zoonotic tick-borne pathogens so that these infections can be recognised, diagnosed and treated promptly. Bacteria present in carcasses can pose a food safety hazard and hunters should be trained in proper harvesting and handling of carcasses.

AB  - Onchocercidae nematodes are heteroxenous parasites with worldwide distribution, and some of the species associated to animals may present zoonotic potential. Climatic changes and anthropic influences on the environment may result in vectors’ proliferation, facilitating the spillover to humans and/or non-typical animal hosts. The Iguaçu National Park (PARNA Iguaçu), one of the most important Brazilian natural remanescents of Atlantic rainforest, is strongly affected by human activities such as tourism and agriculture. The complexity of this area is especially characterized by the close nexus between the rich wildlife, humans, and domestic animals, especially domestic dogs. Based on this, this research aimed to diagnose the Onchocercidae nematodes in wild carnivores and domestic dogs in the PARNA Iguaçu and the surrounding areas. For this, we collected 162 samples of seven species of wild carnivores and 225 samples of domestic dogs. The presence of microfilariae in the blood samples was diagnosed by the modified Knott’s test and molecular screening, and the specific identification was based on sequencing of the myoHC and hsp70 genes. Microfilariae were detected only in ring-tailed coatis, in which we found five species: Mansonella sp. 1, Manso-nela sp. 2, Onchocercidade gen. sp. 1, Onchocercidade gen. sp. 2, and Dirofilaria immitis. The morphological analysis supported the molecular findings. The domestic dogs were par-asitized by Acanthocheilonema reconditum, representing a new locality record for this spe-cies. Phylogenetic analysis showed high genetic similarity among the four undetermined species and Mansonella spp., Brugia spp., and Wuchereria bancrofti. The presence of D. immitis in ring-tailed coatis may be result of spillover from dogs, even though the parasite was not diagnosed in the sampled dogs. The presence of several undetermined Onchocer-cidae species indicates the necessity of continuous investigations on wild and domestic animals from Neotropical area, especially considering the growing anthropic influence on forest remnants. © The Authors.

AB  - Frugivorous bats play a vital role in tropical ecosystems as pollinators and seed dispersers but are also important vectors of zoonotic diseases. Myanmar sits at the intersection of numerous bioregions and contains habitats that are important for many endangered and endemic species. This rapidly developing country also forms a connection between hotspots of emerging human diseases. We deployed Global Positioning System collars to track the movements of 10 Indian flying fox (Pteropus giganteus) in the agricultural landscapes of central Myanmar. We used clustering analysis to identify foraging sites and high-utilization areas. As part of a larger viral surveillance study in bats of Myanmar, we also collected oral and rectal swab samples from 29 bats to test for key emerging viral diseases in this colony. There were no positive results detected for our chosen viruses. We analyzed their foraging movement behavior and evaluated selected foraging sites for their potential as human-wildlife interface sites. © 2021, EcoHealth Alliance.

AB  - Monkeypox is a zoonotic illness transmitted by an orthopox virus that causes smallpox-like symptoms in individuals. Therapies utilized in the smallpox control and elimination also offered immunity to monkeypox. New vaccinations have indeed been discovered, and 1-of-them is licensed for the preventive of monkeypox. Monkeypox was induced by monkeypox virus, which is a species of a Orthopoxvirus subfamily in the Poxviridae group. Monkeypox is often a self-limiting condition, with signs that generally last 2 to 4 weeks. Extreme symptoms are possible. Recently, the fatality rate has hovered at 3-6%. Monkeypox is spread to individuals by directly interacting to an infectious creature or human, or via exposure to virus-contaminated substances. The monkeypox infection spreads by intimate exposure to lesions, bodily liquids, inhalation, or infected items including clothing. Monkeypox seems to be a virus zoonotic illness which typically originates in tropical rainforests regions of middle and western Africa, but is sometimes transported to different parts of the world. An antibody-drug intended to cure smallpox has been approved for use in the treatment of monkeypox. Monkeypox is lesser infectious than smallpox (an orthopoxvirus linked to monkeypox) and generates fewer serious sicknesses. Monkeypox is characterized medically by temperature, rashes, and enlarged lymph nodes, and it can result in a variety of health consequences. In this study, we propose machine learning-based predictions using linear regression, decision tree, random forest, elasticNet, and ARIMA. The ARIMA attained 0.9267 R2 for monkeypox predictions. We hope that based on generated will be helpful for further additional research on society.  © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Toxoplasma gondii is a zoonotic parasite of worldwide distribution. The consumption of infected pork meat has been suggested to be an important source for human infection in the tropical area of Yucatan, Mexico. We performed a cross-sectional study of 12 farms across the state to investigate the seroprevalence of Toxoplasma gondii infection in domestic pigs. In total, 632 samples were obtained from 2 different environmental zones (tropical deciduous low forest and tropical sub-deciduous medium forest) and 2 abattoirs. The modified agglutination test (MAT) was used to assess the seroprevalence of T. gondii in pigs and to evaluate 2 globally used serological tests, the Dye test (DT) and ID Screen® ELISA multi-species, and a commercial ELISA kit (Human Toxo IgG, Human-diagnostics), which is widely used locally in this geographical area. The overall prevalence obtained with the MAT (cut-off ≥1:25) among the 632 pigs was 1.4% (95% CI, 0.6-2.7%). The seroprevalence obtained for the different age groups was 0.6%, 0.7%, 1.8%, and 6.8% among 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, and ≥5-mo-old pigs. This increase in the seroprevalence was statistically significant for the 2 older groups (odds ratio [OR] 3.9-7.1, P < 0.05) in comparison with younger groups. DT at >4 IU dilution had a perfect agreement and 100% of sensitivity and specificity when compared with the MAT. Although ID Screen® had only a fair agreement (κ = 0.389) with the MAT, the McNemar test showed that the results of these tests were comparable (P = 0.29). The Human Toxo ELISA showed no agreement with MAT, ID Screen®, and DT (κ = 0.000-0.023, McNemar P < 0.05). This ELISA was lacking in specificity, accuracy, and precision; hence, we do not recommend its use for T. gondii diagnosis in pig serum.

AB  - Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by mosquitoes. The rapid spread of dengue could lead to a global pandemic, and so the geographical extent of this spread needs to be assessed and predicted. There are also reasons to suggest that transmission of dengue from non-human primates in tropical forest cycles is being underestimated. We investigate the fine-scale geographic changes in transmission risk since the late 20th century, and take into account for the first time the potential role that primate biogeography and sylvatic vectors play in increasing the disease transmission risk. We apply a biogeographic framework to the most recent global dataset of dengue cases. Temporally stratified models describing favorable areas for vector presence and for disease transmission are combined. Our models were validated for predictive capacity, and point to a significant broadening of vector presence in tropical and non-tropical areas globally. We show that dengue transmission is likely to spread to affected areas in China, Papua New Guinea, Australia, USA, Colombia, Venezuela, Madagascar, as well as to cities in Europe and Japan. These models also suggest that dengue transmission is likely to spread to regions where there are presently no or very few reports of occurrence. According to our results, sylvatic dengue cycles account for a small percentage of the global extent of the human case record, but could be increasing in relevance in Asia, Africa, and South America. The spatial distribution of factors favoring transmission risk in different regions of the world allows for distinct management strategies to be prepared. © 2021 Aliaga-Samanez et al.

AB  - The present study shows that the most prominent human arboviruses worldwide (dengue viruses 1, 2, 3, and 4, Chikungunya virus, and Zika virus) can infect wild animals and transfer from urban to sylvatic maintenance cycles in South America, as did the yellow fever virus (YFV) in the past. All these viruses are transmitted by the anthropophilic mosquito Aedes aegypti and cause epidemics throughout Brazil. The YFV is the oldest example of an urban arbovirus that became sylvatic in South America. Currently, the disease is a zoonosis of non-human primates that moves like a wave through the forests of the Brazilian countryside, traveling thousands of kilometers, killing many animals and eventually infecting man. However, since 2016, this zoonotic wave has reached the highly populated areas of Southeast Brazil, producing the largest human outbreak in the past 60 years. As with the YFV, sylvatic cycles may occur with dengue, Chikungunya, and Zika. In order to become sylvatic, arboviruses require an apparently unlikely conjunction of factors to unexpectedly take place. These arboviruses could start to infect sylvatic primates and be transmitted by Haemagogus mosquitoes that inhabit tree canopies. We mention here publications reporting evidence of sylvatic cycles of dengue, Chikungunya, and Zika virus in South America. Indeed, it is almost unfeasible to control these cycles of arboviruses since it is impossible to know where, when or why an arboviral spill-over would occur in wild animals. The sylvatic maintenance cycle could preclude the eradication of an arbovirus. Moreover, an arbovirus in a sylvatic cycle could re-emerge anytime, infecting humans and producing outbreaks. In case of the reemergence of an arbovirus, it is crucial to prevent the occurrence of an urban cycle as a spill-back from the sylvatic cycle. © 2019 Figueiredo.

AB  - Zoonotic diseases represent 75% of emerging infectious diseases worldwide, and their emergence is mainly attributed to human-driven changes in landscapes. Land use change, especially the conversion of natural areas to agricultural use, has the potential to impact hosts and vector dynamics, affecting pathogen transmission risk. While these links are becoming better understood, very few studies have investigated the opposite question—how native vegetation restoration affects zoonotic disease outbreaks. We reviewed the existing evidence linking native vegetation restoration with zoonotic transmission risk, identified knowledge gaps, and, by focusing on tropical areas, proposed forest restoration strategies that could help in limiting the spread of zoonotic diseases. We identified a large gap in information on the effects of native vegetation restoration on zoonotic diseases, especially within tropical regions. In addition, the few studies that exist do not consider environmental aspects that can affect the outcomes of restoration on disease risk, such as the land use history and landscape structural characteristics (as composition and configuration of native habitats). Our conceptual framework raises two important points: (1) the effects of forest restoration may depend on the context of the existing landscape, especially the percentage of native vegetation existing at the beginning of the restoration; and (2) these effects will also be dependent on the spatial arrangement of the restored area within the existing landscape. Furthermore, we propose important topics to be studied in the coming years to integrate zoonotic disease risk as a criterion in restoration planning. Synthesis and application. Our results contribute to a more comprehensive forest restoration planning, comprising multiple ecosystem services and resulting in healthier landscapes for both people and nature. Our framework could be integrated into the post-2020 global biodiversity framework targets. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Deforestation is a major cause of biodiversity loss with a negative impact on human health. This study explores at global scale whether the loss and gain of forest cover and the rise of oil palm plantations can promote outbreaks of vector-borne and zoonotic diseases. Taking into account the human population growth, we find that the increases in outbreaks of zoonotic and vector-borne diseases from 1990 to 2016 are linked with deforestation, mostly in tropical countries, and with reforestation, mostly in temperate countries. We also find that outbreaks of vector-borne diseases are associated with the increase in areas of palm oil plantations. Our study gives new support for a link between global deforestation and outbreaks of zoonotic and vector-borne diseases as well as evidences that reforestation and plantations may also contribute to epidemics of infectious diseases. The results are discussed in light of the importance of forests for biodiversity, livelihoods and human health and the need to urgently build an international governance framework to ensure the preservation of forests and the ecosystem services they provide, including the regulation of diseases. We develop recommendations to scientists, public health officers and policymakers who should reconcile the need to preserve biodiversity while taking into account the health risks posed by lack or mismanagement of forests. © Copyright © 2021 Morand and Lajaunie.

AB  - Leptospirosis is an emerging zoonotic disease caused by bacteria of the genus Leptospira. Wild animals may present acute disease or become chronic hosts. The present study aimed to identify Leptospira spp. infection and determine circulating serogroups in free-ranging sambar deer (Rusa unicolor) in a fragment of peri-urban tropical forest in northeastern Brazil. Blood samples were collected and subjected to microscopic agglutination testing (MAT) and PCR analysis (genes lipL32 and secY). Anti-Leptospira antibodies were detected in 60% of the animals tested, with serogroups Cynopteri (33.4%), Hebdomadis (22.2%) and Grippotyphosa (22.2%) identified as most prevalent. DNA corresponding to the pathogenic species Leptospira interrogans was detected in 2/15 (13.3%) of the samples tested. Sambar deer experience a high level of exposure to Leptospira spp. in our epidemiological setting. It is important to emphasize the implementation of effective measures (i.e., maintaining habitats and reducing human contact) for the conservation of endangered species. © 2022, EcoHealth Alliance.

AB  - Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease of world importance, and its transmission depends on the interaction between humans and animals. Given the necessity to investigate potential hosts of Leptospira spp., this study verified the prevalence of different serovars in the species of Rhipidomys spp., a widespread sigmodont rodent in Brazil. The studied population originates from a semi-evergreen forest located in the county of Uberlândia, in the state of Minas Gerais. The microscopic agglutination test (MAT) was performed with 14 serovars. Thirteen out of the 43 wild rodents captured showed a positive agglutination reaction, with a greater prevalence of the serovars Pyrogenes, Copenhageni, and Canicola. This study found a prevalence of 30.3% anti-Leptospira spp. antibodies; all positive animals were reactive to more than one serovar. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - The colonization of afro-tropical wildlife with Staphylococcus aureus and the derived clade Staphylococcus schweitzeri remains largely unknown. A reservoir in bats could be of importance since bats and humans share overlapping habitats. In addition, bats are food sources in some African regions and can be the cause of zoonotic diseases. Here, we present a cross-sectional survey employing pharyngeal swabs of captured and released bats (n = 133) in a forest area of Gabon. We detected low colonization rates of S. aureus (4–6%) and S. schweitzeri (4%) in two out of four species of fruit bats, namely Rousettus aegyptiacus and Micropteropus pusillus, but not in insectivorous bats. Multilocus sequence typing showed that S. aureus from Gabonese bats (ST2984, ST3259, ST3301, ST3302) were distinct from major African human associated clones (ST15, ST121, ST152). S. schweitzeri from bats (ST1697, ST1700) clustered with S. schweitzeri from other species (bats, monkeys) from Nigeria and Côte d'Ivoire. In conclusion, colonization rates of bats with S. aureus and S. schweitzeri were low in our study. Phylogenetic analysis supports an intense geographical dispersal of S. schweitzeri among different mammalian wildlife hosts. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Small-mammal faunas of tropical savannas consist of endemic assemblages of murid rodents, small marsupials, and insectivores on four continents. Small mammals in tropical savannas are understudied compared to other tropical habitats and other taxonomic groups (e.g., Afrotropical megafauna or Neotropical rainforest mammals). Their importance as prey, ecosystem engineers, disease reservoirs, and declining members of endemic biodiversity in tropical savannas compels us to understand the factors that regulate their abundance and diversity. We reviewed field studies published in the last 35 years that examined, mostly experimentally, the effects of varying three primary endogenous disturbances in tropical savanna ecosystems—fire, large mammalian herbivory (LMH), and drought—on abundance and diversity of non-volant small mammals. These disturbances are most likely to affect habitat structure (cover or concealment), food availability, or both, for ground-dwelling small mammalian herbivores, omnivores, and insectivores. Of 63 studies (included in 55 published papers) meeting these criteria from the Afrotropics, Neotropics, and northern Australia (none was found from southern Asia), 29 studies concluded that small mammals responded (mostly negatively) to a loss of cover (mostly from LMH and fire); four found evidence of increased predation on small mammals in lower-cover treatments (e.g., grazed or burned). Eighteen studies concluded a combination of food- and cover-limitation explained small-mammal responses to endogenous disturbances. Only two studies concluded small-mammal declines in response to habitat-altering disturbance were caused by food limitation and not related to cover reduction. Evidence to date indicates that abundance and richness of small savanna mammals, in general (with important exceptions), is enhanced by vegetative cover (especially tall grass, but sometimes shrub cover) as refugia for these prey species amid a “landscape of fear,” particularly for diurnal, non-cursorial, and non-fossorial species. These species have been called “decreasers” in response to cover reduction, whereas a minority of small-mammal species have been shown to be “increasers” or disturbance-tolerant. Complex relationships between endogenous disturbances and small-mammal food resources are important secondary factors, but only six studies manipulated or measured food resources simultaneous to habitat manipulations. While more such studies are needed, designing effective ones for cryptic consumer communities of omnivorous dietary opportunists is a significant challenge.

AB  - Toxoplasmosis is an important zoonotic disease that affects a wide range of warm-blooded host species. Neotropical primates (New World Primates; NWP) are highly susceptible, developing a lethal acute systemic disease. Toxoplasmosis in free-ranging NWP is poorly described, with only a few studies based on serosurveys. Herein we performed a retrospective study focusing on the epidemiology and pathology of toxoplasmosis among 1,001 free-ranging marmoset (Callithrix spp.) deaths from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. This study included marmosets necropsied at the Instituto Municipal de Medicina Veterinária Jorge Vaitsman (IJV) from January 2017 to July 2019, which were found dead from all regions in the State of Rio de Janeiro. Histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and transmission electron microscopy were performed to better characterize toxoplasmosis in this free-ranging population. All samples were also tested for Yellow Fever Virus (YFV) RT-qPCR by the official diagnostic service. A total of 1,001 free-ranging marmosets were included in this study, with 16 (1.6%) cases of lethal Toxoplasma gondii infections identified both as individual cases and in outbreaks. Presence of infection was not associated with sex, age, geographical distribution, or year of death, and no co-infection with YFV was observed. The main pathological feature in these cases was random necrotizing hepatitis with detection of intralesional T. gondii zoites in all infected cases. Interstitial pneumonia rich in alveolar foamy macrophages and fibrin deposition, necrotizing myocarditis and necrotizing splenitis were also pathological features in affected marmosets. Therefore, toxoplasmosis was considered the cause of death in 1.6% of free-ranging marmosets in this retrospective series, including some cases associated with outbreaks. Necrotizing random hepatitis was a consistent pathological finding in affected cases and sampling of liver should be ensured from Callitrichid post mortem cases. © 2022 Rodrigues Oliveira et al.

AB  - The helminth Echinococcus vogeli Rausch & Bernstein, 1972 is a causative agent of Neotropical Echinococcosis, a chronic zoonotic disease which is endemic to the Neotropical region. This parasite is transmitted from bush dogs (Speothos venaticus) to their prey, which include lowland pacas (Cuniculus paca) and agoutis (Dasyprocta spp.). In Brazil, most human cases of Neotropical Echinococcosis have been recorded in the Amazonian states of Acre and Pará, although few data are available on the occurrence of the potential definitive or intermediate hosts of E. vogeli in the Amazon region. In the present study, we surveyed the forests surrounding 46 human communities located within and around of outside six sustainable-use protected areas in the southwestern Amazon basin of Brazil. The forests were surveyed using camera traps to determine the local presence of potential wild hosts of E. vogeli, and the exploitation of these hosts for game meat was evaluated through interviews with 136 subsistence hunters resident in the local communities. We recorded pacas, agoutis, and bush dogs, as well as domestic dogs (Canis familiaris), all potential reservoirs of Neotropical Echinococcosis, using the same habitats. We also confirmed the frequent consumption of paca and agouti meat by subsistence hunters and their families in the study communities. Our data contribute to the understanding of the occurrence of E. vogeli in Brazilian ecosystems. © 2022, Universidade Estadual de Campinas UNICAMP. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Old World tropical and subtropical frugivorous bat genus Rousettus (Pteropodidae) contains species with broad distributions, as well as those occurring in restricted geographical areas, particularly islands. Herein we review the role of Rousettus as a keystone species from a global “One Health” approach and related to ecosystem functioning, zoonotic disease and public health. Rousettus are efficient at dispersing seeds and pollinating flowers; their role in forest regeneration is related to their ability to fly considerable distances during nightly foraging bouts and their relatively small body size, which allows them to access fruits in forested areas with closed vegetation. Rousettus are also reservoirs for various groups of pathogens (viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoa), which, by definition, are infectious agents causing disease. The study of day roosts of different species of Rousettus and the successful establishment of captive breeding colonies have provided important details related to the infection dynamics of their associated pathogens. Large-scale conversion of forested areas into agricultural landscapes has increased contact between humans and Rousettus, therefore augmenting the chances of infectious agent spillover. Many crucial scientific details are still lacking related to members of this genus, which have direct bearing on the prevention of emerging disease outbreaks, as well as the conservation of these bats. The public should be better informed on the capacity of fruit bats as keystone species for large scale forest regeneration and in spreading pathogens. Precise details on the transmission of zoonotic diseases of public health importance associated with Rousettus should be given high priority. © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - Bird–biting mosquitoes act as bridge vectors of diverse pathogens of emerging infectious diseases. In this study, we report for the first time the abundance, diversity, distribution, and feeding pattern of bird-biting mosquitoes on an island where avifaunal diversity is rich. Monthly mosquito collections were done at six different habitats in three different climatic zones using bird-baited traps over a year. Collected mosquitoes were identified using morphological and molecular tools. A total of 2,655 bird-biting mosquitoes of eight genera and 25 species were identified. Of these, 52% were Culex species, which represents 35% of the Culex species in the country. The most abundant species were Culex sitiens, Cx. pseudovishnui, Cx. nigropunctatus and Cx. quinquefasciatus, whereas the latter two were common to all habitats. The highest abundance was reported in lowland forests (49.6%), while it was lowest in highland forests (22.3%). Highest species similarity was reported from highland forests. Seasonal variations of the most abundant species were significantly different in selected habitats (p< 0.05). Two distinct biting peaks were identified, from 06:00 to 21:00 and 22:00 to 02:00. The biting nature of identified ornithophilic mosquitoes suggests the potential vector status of these mosquitoes. © 2018 The Society for Vector Ecology

AB  - Desmodus rotundus, vampire bats, transmit dangerous infections, and brucellosis is a hazardous zoonotic disease, two adversities that coexist in the subtropical and tropical areas of the American continent. Here, we report a 47.89% Brucella infection prevalence in a colony of vampire bats inhabiting the tropical rainforest of Costa Rica. The bacterium induced placentitis and fetal death in bats. Wide-range phenotypic and genotypic characterization placed the Brucella organisms as a new pathogenic species named Brucella nosferati sp. nov., isolated from bat tissues, including the salivary glands, suggesting feeding behavior might favor transmission to their prey. Overall analyses placed B. nosferati as the etiological agent of a reported canine brucellosis case, demonstrating its potential for infecting other hosts. To assess the putative prey hosts, we analyzed the intestinal contents of 14 infected and 23 non-infected bats by proteomics. A total of 54,508 peptides sorted into 7,203 unique peptides corresponding to 1,521 proteins were identified.Twenty-three wildlife and domestic taxa, including humans, were foraged by B. nosferati-infected D. rotundus, suggesting contact of this bacterium with a broad range of hosts. Our approach is appropriate for detecting, in a single study, the prey preferences of vampire bats in a diverse area, demonstrating its suitability for control strategies where vampire bats thrive.  © 2023 Hernández-Mora et al.

AB  - Introduction: An important ecosystem service tropical forests provide is disease control. However, few studies have focused on analyzing how species more suitable to be zoonotic vectors are affected by deforestation. Objective: We evaluated how deforestation affects the abundance and species richness of rodents and their associated ectoparasites in Marques de Comillas, Chiapas, Southern Mexico. Methods: We captured rodents in 6 landscape units (LU), 1 km² each, with different percentages of tree cover (0.7, 5, 40, 46, 78, and 95 %). In each LU we set 90 Sherman traps that remained active 24 hours for 7 days during two sampling seasons in October 2019, and September 2020. All the captured rodents were checked for ectoparasites in their fur, which were collected to be identified at the lab. Results: We captured 70 rodents of five species: Sigmodon toltecus, Heteromys desmarestianus, Ototylomys phyllotis, Peromyscus mexicanus, and Oryzomys couesi. Rodent abundance increased with forest loss (R² = 0.706, P = 0.022). The greatest richness of rodent species occurred in sites with intermediate forest cover (40 % and 78 %). The most abundant species were S. toltecus (N = 45) followed by O. couesi (N = 9), these species dominated in sites with less forest cover. We recorded a total of 23 different ectoparasites, from these we identified 15 at the species level and eight at the genus level. We detected three species of ectoparasites (Amblyomma sp., Ornithonyssus bacoti, and Androlaelaps fahrenholzi) known to be vectors of zoonotic diseases. Conclusions: We found that the ongoing loss of forests promotes the proliferation of zoonotic disease vectors, which can potentially increase the frequency of affectation among the local population. © 2023, Universidad de Costa Rica.

AB  - Leishmaniasis is a vector-borne disease caused by the protozoan Leishmania spp. mainly affecting individuals of low socioeconomic status. In tropical regions the transmission risk to humans depends not only on environmental factors, such as vegetation cover and climate, but also on the socioeconomic characteristics of human populations. However, the relative contribution of these factors to disease risk and incidence is not well understood. Yet this information is critical for the development of epidemiological surveillance schemes and control practices. Leishmaniasis cases have increased in São Paulo state, Brazil over recent years but the underlying risk factors for transmission remain understudied. Here, we use generalized linear mixed models to quantify the association between occurrence and incidence (number of cases) of cutaneous (CL) and visceral (VL) leishmaniasis from 1998 to 2015, and landscape (native vegetation cover), climate (seasonal and interannual variation in precipitation and temperature) and socioeconomic factors (population, number of cattle heads, Human Development Index - HDI, Gini inequality index and income per capita) across the 645 municipalities of São Paulo state, Brazil. For CL, probability of occurrence was greater in municipalities with high native vegetation cover and economic inequality and in years with greater average winter precipitation. For VL, probability of occurrence was greater in years with high minimum spring precipitation and maximum annual temperatures, and in municipalities with larger HDI values and a greater number of cattle heads. The number of VL cases increased during years with high mean fall precipitation and, for both CL and VL the number of cases was greater in years of high annual mean temperature. Understanding how these risk factors influence spatial and temporal variation in the risk and incidence of leishmaniasis can contribute to the development of effective public health policies and interventions. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The last few decades have witnessed an appalling rise in several emerging and re-emerging viral and zoonotic outbreaks. Such outbreaks are a lesson to learn from and seek insight into better disease monitoring and surveillance, thus preventing future outbreaks. Monkeypox, a viral zoonotic illness caused by the monkeypox virus, may no longer be endemic to the tropical rainforests of Central and West Africa. However, the current monkeypox outbreak in nonendemic countries is most likely due to failure to curb the disease dissemination in endemic African regions despite decades of constant outbreaks. The clinical manifestations are typified by a prodromal phase (fever, myalgia, malaise, and lymphadenopathy) followed by maculopapular or vesicular, or pustular cutaneous eruptions that eventually form encrustations and peel off. Children and the elderly, pregnant females, and individuals living with comorbidities (diabetes, HIV/AIDS, and lymphoproliferative ailments) are at a high risk of severe disease. Monkeypox is a self-limiting disorder, but its complications and pandemic potential signify its immense public health relevance. The recent ongoing monkeypox outbreak in nonendemic nations areas was identified with increased propensity in men who have sex with men (MSMs) with no travel history to endemic regions, emphasizing the changing trends in disease transmission. This review article provides an updated overview of the monkeypox disease taxonomy, pathogenesis, transmission, epidemiology, clinical and oral features, diagnostic aids, differential diagnosis, preventive aspects, and treatment protocol. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - An estimated 75 percent of new infectious diseases are zoonotic in origin, directly resulting from human and animal interactions (CDC, 2017). New diseases like COVID-19 most often originate from biodiversity hotspots such as tropical rainforests, and forest loss represents one of the most significant forms of environmental degradation facilitating new human and animal interactions. A political-economy approach illuminates how trade inequalities lead to the exploitation of the environment and people in poor nations, creating conditions under which pandemics like COVID-19 appear. Cross-national patterns in deforestation and forest use illuminate how consumers in the Global North are keenly tied to the emergence of zoonotic diseases. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Over the last several decades the rate of forest clearance has increased considerably. Millions of hectares of forests are lost every year for agricultural activities and timber extraction, which have significant consequences on atmospheric CO2, climate change and ecological interactions. Many studies carried out in perturbed habitats or areas that have gone through significant habitat loss have reported changes in vector-borne diseases dynamics, with an altered abundance of both the invertebrate and vertebrate hosts that has led to changes in pathogen prevalence. Following deforestation, altered microclimates with changes in temperatures, sunlight, and moisture and the addition of artificial breeding habitats tend to favour common vectors of disease, such as species of the mosquito genera Anopheles, Aedes and Culex. Land conversion for agricultural use also provides increased accessibility to blood meals with domesticated animals breeding in close quarters of humans. In fact, approximately three fourths of human emerging infectious diseases are caused by zoonotic pathogens due to the increasing contact among humans, domestic animal populations and wildlife hosts. The malaria parasite Plasmodium knowlesi and the Mayaro virus are examples of mosquito-borne zoonoses that jumped recently from wild hosts to humans following their encroachment into tropical forests. However, at the moment, it is simply unknown how many pathogens are transmitted to wildlife by mosquitoes and while many studies have shed light on the dynamics of avian malaria or the West Nile Virus, many other parasites and the likely multitude of undiscovered viruses are still poorly studied. The reality is that with rapid environmental change, without in-depth research on mosquitoes that feed on wildlife and the pathogens they harbour, we will not be able to predict why diseases emerge and what factors exacerbate their spread. © 2022.

AB  - We present a case of Sarcoptes and canine distemper virus (CDV) infection in a white-nosed coati (Nasua narica) that was trapped in the dry tropical forest of Cerro Blanco reserve, located in the coastal region of Ecuador. Sarcoptic mange is a highly contagious and zoonotic disease with worldwide distribution that causes epidemics. Mange is produced by Sarcoptes mites that causes severe epidermal damage. Secondary infections and physiological constrictions without treatment can lead to death of the host. In addition, cooccurrence of canine distemper virus was detected via iiRT-PCR from serum samples. Physical analyses showed that 90% of the skin was affected by severe alopecia due to the sarcoptic mange infection. The presence of mites and histopathological analyses confirmed the diagnosis of infection. This coati was taken to a veterinary clinic and was fed every day, but it died after four days. This is the first report of sarcoptic mange and the first report of CDV in white-nosed coatis in South America. Further studies are needed in this region, to seek out other suspected cases, given the high capacity for disease transmission. Preventive actions to avoid epidemic and zoonotic episodes are needed. © 2022, Brazilain Coll Veterinary Parasitology. All rights reserved.

AB  - Climatic changes, landscape management, massive human, animal and commodity transportation represent important factors which are contributing to the spread of zoonotic diseases. The environmental and socioeconomic factors affecting the incidence of vector-borne zoonoses and possibilities for the reduction of disease impacts are discussed in the article. The most important zoonoses with expanding area of incidence and/or increasing occurrence are summarized, with special emphasis on the European region. While some diseases and their respective pathogens are indigenous to Europe (e.g. Lyme disease), others have been introduced to Europe from tropical areas (e.g. chikungunya or dengue fever). These emerging diseases may represent a serious threat in near future and better understanding of their spreading mechanisms, pathogenesis and consequent treatment is very important. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

We assessed the potential effects of climate change on the distribution of R. sanguineus in the Americas in 2050 and 2070 using the general circulation model CanESM5 and two shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs), SSP2-4.5 (moderate emissions) and SSP2-8.5 (high emissions). A total of 355 occurrence points of R. sanguineus and eight uncorrelated bioclimatic variables were entered into a maximum entropy algorithm (MaxEnt) to produce 50 replicates per scenario. The area under the curve (AUC) value for the consensus model (>0.90) and the partial ROC value (>1.28) indicated a high predictive capacity. The models showed that the geographic regions currently suitable for R. sanguineus will remain stable in the future, but also predicted increases in habitat suitability in the Western U.S., Venezuela, Brazil and Bolivia. Scenario 4.5 showed an increase in habitat suitability for R. sanguineus in tropical and subtropical regions in both 2050 and 2070. Habitat suitability is predicted to remain constant in moist broadleaf forests and deserts but is predicted to decrease in flooded grasslands and savannas. Using the high emissions SSP5-8.5 scenario, habitat suitability in tropical and subtropical coniferous forests and temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands was predicted to be constant in 2050. In 2070, however, habitat suitability was predicted to decrease in tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests and increase in tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests. Our findings suggest that the current and potential future geographic distributions can be used in evidence-based strategies in the design of control plans aimed at reducing the risk of exposure to zoonotic diseases transmitted by R. sanguineus. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - At a time when more than 5 million tonnes of bushmeat are harvested annually from tropical forests, and which account for a significant, but unrecorded, share of the gross domestic product of many forest countries, decision makers are encouraged, within conservation and food security policies, to understand the role that wildlife can play in the conservation of ecosystem services. In this article, we present an analysis of the problem, describing the role played by bushmeat in human diets, and the health risks linked to the consumption of bushmeat, in particular with regard to Ebola disease, to provide insights on the direction of possible strategies to manage the use of wildlife for meeting the needs of local populations and reducing risks to human health. © 2019 Societe Francaise de Sante Publique.

AB  - Tropical deforestation drivers are complex and can change rapidly in periods of profound societal transformation, such as those during a pandemic. Evidence suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic has spurred illegal, opportunistic forest clearing in tropical countries, threatening forest ecosystems and their resident human communities. A total of 9583 km2 of deforestation alerts from Global Land Analysis & Discovery (GLAD) were detected across the global tropics during the first month following the implementation of confinement measures of local governments to reduce COVID-19 spread, which is nearly double that of 2019 (4732 km2). We present a conceptual framework linking tropical deforestation and the current pandemic. Zoonotic diseases, public health, economy, agriculture, and forests may all be reciprocally linked in complex positive and negative feedback loops with overarching consequences. We highlight the emerging threats to nature and society resulting from this complex reciprocal interplay and possible policy interventions that could minimize these threats. © 2020 Associação Brasileira de Ciência Ecológica e Conservação

AB  - Recent studies document that brown dog ticks, previously considered as Rhipicephalus sanguineus, are actually comprised of multiple taxonomic units now referred to as Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato (Rssl); two lineages of Rssl have been described in the Americas to date – tropical and temperate. To identify the lineage of Rssl from dogs or premises at multiple sites in the United States and the Caribbean, we evaluated ticks (n = 191) collected from several geographic locations (n = 21), including Arizona, California, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Oklahoma, and Texas in the United States, and from Haiti. All ticks were identified as brown dog ticks by morphologic examination and comparison to standard keys. Sequence analysis of 12S rRNA mitochondrial gene fragments confirmed the presence of both lineages, with the Rssl tropical lineage predominating in Florida, Haiti, Hawaii, and far southern Texas (n = 9 locations) and the Rssl temperate lineage present in California, Oklahoma, and Texas (n = 12 locations). Mixed populations were not identified although the temperate lineage appeared to separate into two distinct clades. Analysis of additional brown dog tick specimens from the region will allow more complete understanding of the full extent of diversity in the R. sanguineus complex and likely has important implications for disease transmission, including zoonotic risk. © 2017 The Authors

AB  -                              The number of microbes on Earth may be 10                             30                             , exceeding all other diversity. A small number of these can infect people and cause disease. The diversity of parasitic organisms likely correlates with the hosts they live in and the number mammal hosts for zoonotic infections increases with species richness among mammalian orders. Thus, while habitat loss and fragmentation may reduce species diversity, the habitat encroachment by people into species-rich areas may increase the exposure of people to novel infectious agents from wildlife. Here, we present a theoretical framework that exploits the species-area relationship to link the exposure of people to novel infections with habitat biodiversity. We model changes in human exposure to microbes through defined classes of habitat fragmentation and predict that increased habitat division intrinsically increases the hazard from microbes for all modelled biological systems. We apply our model to African tropical forests as an example. Our results suggest that it is possible to identify high-risk areas for the mitigation and surveillance of novel disease emergence and that mitigation measures may reduce this risk while conserving biodiversity.                          © 2018 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

AB  - By 2050 our civilized planet may be comprised predominantly of networked megacities embedded in warm subtropical and tropical climates, and under stress from climate change and catastrophic weather events. Urban slum areas in these cities, including those found in wealthier middle- and high-income nations (blue marble health), will be especially vulnerable to disease. Moreover, regional conflicts fought over shifting and limited resources, including water, will collapse health systems infrastructures to further promote disease emergence and reemergence. Thus while by 2050 we might congratulate ourselves for successfully eliminating some key parasitic and neglected tropical diseases such as dracunculiasis, lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, and human African trypanosomiasis, there could be a commensurate rise in other parasitic diseases based on the scenarios highlighted above. Of particular concern are urban and newly urbanized helminth infections, including schistosomiasis and some soil-transmitted helminth infections, as well zoonotic helminthiases, such as toxocariasis, food-borne trematodiases, and cysticercosis. Protozoan infections persisting in urban environments, including leishmaniasis, Chagas disease, malaria, and intestinal protozoan infections, will also remain, as will zoonotic diseases such as toxoplasmosis. Our best hope to counteract the parasitic diseases emerging in our steaming 21st century megacities is to develop new and innovative technologies through gene editing, systems biology, and immunology, and the new single-celled OMICs. However, success on this front will require our ability to contain the globalization of antiscience beliefs and sentiments. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Leptospirosis is a bacterial zoonotic disease with multiple serogroups that infects wildlife and humans alike. Several studies have detected the presence of leptospiral antibodies in captive Neotropical primates, suggesting that they are asymptomatic carriers. However, the presence of antibodies in free-ranging primates and their potential role as reservoirs for this pathogen is not known. In this study, we used the Microscopic Agglutination Test (MAT) to screen two species of free-ranging tamarins for the presence of Leptospira antibodies using a panel of 21 serogroups. A total of 56 primates (26 Leontocebus weddelli and 30 Saguinus imperator) were screened at the Estación Biológica Río Los Amigos in Madre de Dios, Peru. MAT results with titres of ≥100 in single samples were considered seropositive. Prevalence ratios (PR) were estimated for age group, sex and host species identity. Overall, 51.8% (29/56) of animals were reactive for at least one Leptospira serogroup. Serogroups were distributed as follows: Iquitos (41.1%), Icterohaemorrhagiae (14.3%), Sejroe (3.6%), Autumnalis (1.8%) and Bataviae (1.8%). No significant differences (p >.05) were found for seropositivity frequencies among categories within assessed variables. These results suggest that free-ranging L. weddelli and S. imperator might serve as reservoirs for pathogenic Leptospira serogroups. Given increasing human-wildlife contact, future studies that test for active infection are required to determine potential transmission risks to humans. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.

AB  - Zoonoses originating from wildlife represent a significant threat to global health, security and economic growth, and combatting their emergence is a public health priority. However, our understanding of the mechanisms underlying their emergence remains rudimentary. Here we update a global database of emerging infectious disease (EID) events, create a novel measure of reporting effort, and fit boosted regression tree models to analyze the demographic, environmental and biological correlates of their occurrence. After accounting for reporting effort, we show that zoonotic EID risk is elevated in forested tropical regions experiencing land-use changes and where wildlife biodiversity (mammal species richness) is high. We present a new global hotspot map of spatial variation in our zoonotic EID risk index, and partial dependence plots illustrating relationships between events and predictors. Our results may help to improve surveillance and long-term EID monitoring programs, and design field experiments to test underlying mechanisms of zoonotic disease emergence. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Rodents are important reservoirs of numerous viruses, some of which have significant impacts on public health. Ecosystem disturbances and decreased host species richness have been associated with the emergence of zoonotic diseases. In this study, we aimed at (a) characterizing the viral diversity in seven neotropical rodent species living in four types of habitats and (b) exploring how the extent of environmental disturbance influences this diversity. Through a metagenomic approach, we identified 77,767 viral sequences from spleen, kidney, and serum samples. These viral sequences were attributed to 27 viral families known to infect vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, and amoeba. Viral diversities were greater in pristine habitats compared with disturbed ones, and lowest in peri-urban areas. High viral richness was observed in savannah areas. Differences in these diversities were explained by rare viruses that were generally more frequent in pristine forest and savannah habitats. Moreover, changes in the ecology and behavior of rodent hosts, in a given habitat, such as modifications to the diet in disturbed vs. pristine forests, are major determinants of viral composition. Lastly, the phylogenetic relationships of four vertebrate-related viral families (Polyomaviridae, Flaviviridae, Togaviridae, and Phenuiviridae) highlighted the wide diversity of these viral families, and in some cases, a potential risk of transmission to humans. All these findings provide significant insights into the diversity of rodent viruses in Amazonia, and emphasize that habitats and the host’s dietary ecology may drive viral diversity. Linking viral richness and abundance to the ecology of their hosts and their responses to habitat disturbance could be the starting point for a better understanding of viral emergence and for future management of ecosystems. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Efforts to curb the unsustainable wildlife trade in tropical forests conceptualize bushmeat as a generic resource, exploited by a homogeneous group. However, bushmeat is composed of miscellaneous species differing in risks of zoonotic disease transmissions, sensitivity to hunting and abundance. If people choose these species for varying reasons, mitigation approaches that neglect specific drivers would likely target abundant species, e.g. rodents. Meanwhile, rare species of greater conservation relevance, like many primates, would be overlooked. Additionally, if reasons vary between user groups, their responsiveness to interventions may differ too. We assessed this possibility for three common strategies to mitigate bushmeat use, which are: development-based—reducing reliance on bushmeat; educational—increasing environmental and school education; and cultural—promoting environmentally friendly habits. We interviewed 348 hunters, 202 traders and 985 consumers of bushmeat around Taï National Park, Côte d'Ivoire, and tested if factors related to the above strategies affected selection for primates, duikers and rodents. Our analyses revealed that people chose taxa for very different reasons. Users with shared characteristics favoured similar taxa; hunters economically reliant on bushmeat income targeted primates and duikers, while hunters and consumers nutritionally reliant on wildlife protein preferred rodents. Different groups used the same taxa for varying reasons. For example, hunting of primates was associated with economic needs, while their consumption appeared a matter of status. Meanwhile, cultural habits, like religion, specifically affected consumption and taboos inhibited the use of primates; environmental awareness was linked to lower utilization of most taxa within most user groups. Our results demonstrate that educational-, cultural-, and development-based strategies may address different needs and taxa. Consumers may present a key target group, as they rejected rare species for multiple cultural and educational reasons. Notably, the widespread effect of environmental awareness could facilitate large-scale demand-reduction approaches. Nevertheless, there is no one-size-fits-all solution and campaigns need to be tailored to specific taxa and user groups. Ultimately, clear target definitions, prior in-depth research, community-driven solutions and tools from marketing and psychology may help to design novel strategies that encompass the diversity of bushmeat species and its users.

AB  - The Amazon, which is the largest rainforest on Earth, has significant implications for both regional and global weather and climate. The recent fires and environmental degradation in combination with a changing climate already have and will continue to have major effects on the forest. A home to nearly a third of the world's biodiversity, the Amazon is the greatest expression of life on Earth, yet it is under attack. The Amazon rainforest is not evolutionarily adapted to seasonal fire, thus the rapid expansion of the human frontier with fire has been devastating. The siege on the rainforest through fire for agricultural purposes has gradually eroded the natural defenses of the rainforest against fires and driven the Amazon toward a tipping point. In most cases, these fires are purposely started to drive indigenous peoples from their land, and in combination with the increasing average surface temperatures engendered by climate change, tropical fires are more likely to be more extensive. In turn, fires release massive amounts of carbon dioxide and diminish the carbon sequestering capacity of tropical forests, contributing to GHG emissions that cause climate change. The literature we review suggests that this will only exacerbate the weather and climate extremes that impact not only the Amazon, but our entire planet. With the erosion of the rainforest has come a parallel erosion of indigenous land rights and violations of human rights. These complex factors involved in the degradation of the Amazon warrant a scientific, political, economic, and cultural approach. © 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - French Guiana is a European ultraperipheric region located on the northern Atlantic coast of South America. It constitutes an important forested region for biological conservation in the Neotropics. Although very sparsely populated, with its inhabitants mainly concentrated on the Atlantic coastal strip and along the two main rivers, it is marked by the presence and development of old and new epidemic disease outbreaks, both research and health priorities. In this review paper, we synthetize 15 years of multidisciplinary and integrative research at the interface between wildlife, ecosystem modification, human activities and sociodemographic development, and human health. This study reveals a complex epidemiological landscape marked by important transitional changes, facilitated by increased interconnections between wildlife, land-use change and human occupation and activity, human and trade transportation, demography with substantial immigration, and identified vector and parasite pharmacological resistance. Among other French Guianese characteristics, we demonstrate herein the existence of more complex multi-host disease life cycles than previously described for several disease systems in Central and South America, which clearly indicates that today the greater promiscuity between wildlife and humans due to demographic and economic pressures may offer novel settings for microbes and their hosts to circulate and spread. French Guiana is a microcosm that crystallizes all the current global environmental, demographic and socioeconomic change conditions, which may favor the development of ancient and future infectious diseases. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - “Ecosystem Health recognizes the inherent interdependence of the health of humans, animals and ecosystems and explores the perspectives, theories and methodologies emerging at the interface between ecological and health sciences.” This broad focus requires new approaches and methods for solving problems of greater complexity at larger scales than ever before. Nowhere is this point more salient than the case of disease emergence and control at the human-non human primate interface in shrinking tropical forests under great anthropogenic pressure. This special edition brings together transdisciplinary experts who have created successful partnerships leading to advances in ecosystem approaches to health for wild ape populations with relevance to all developing country tropical forest environments. It is no coincidence that the advances herein highlight two long term health projects—the Gombe Ecosystem Health Project (Gombe National Park, Tanzania), and the Taï Chimpanzee Project (TCP) in Côte d'Ivoire—since standardizing and validating noninvasive disease surveillance, risk assessment and management methods presents a special series of challenges where time is a major factor. Advances highlighted in this addition include: health surveillance and monitoring, health risk analysis, field immobilization and interventions, human-NHP networks/interfaces, diagnostic tool development, and cutting edge molecular and genetic techniques. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - This review paper discusses the Stockholm Paradigm (SP) as a theoretical framework and practical computational instrument for studying and assessing the risk of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) as a result of climate change. The SP resolves the long-standing parasite paradox and explains how carbon emissions in the atmosphere increase parasites’ generalization and intensify host switches from animals to humans. The SP argues that the growing rate of novel EID occurrence caused by mutated zoonotic pathogens is related to the following factors brought together as a unified issue of humanity: (a) carbon emissions and consequent climate change; (b) resettlement/migration of people with hyper-urbanization; (c) overpopulation; and (d) human-induced distortion of the biosphere. The SP demonstrates that, in an evolutionary way, humans now play a role migratory birds once played in spreading parasite pathogens between the three Earth megabiotopes (northern coniferous forest belt; tropical/equatorial rainforest areas; and hot/cold deserts), i.e., the role of “super-spreaders” of parasitic viruses, bacteria, fungi and protozoa. This makes humans extremely vulnerable to the EID threat. The SP sees the +1.0–+1.2 °C limit as the optimal target for the slow, yet feasible curbing of the EID hazard to public health (150–200 years). Reaching merely the +2.0 °C level will obviously be an EID catastrophe, as it may cause two or three pandemics each year. We think it useful and advisable to include the SP-based research in the scientific repository of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, since EID appearance and spread are indirect but extremely dangerous consequences of climate change. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Brazil is a large tropical country (8,14,15km2) with 185,360,000 inhabitants. More than one third of its territory is covered by tropical forests or other natural ecosystems. These provide ideal conditions for the existence of many arboviruses, which are maintained in a large variety of zoonotic cycles. The risk that new arboviruses might emerge in Brazil is related to the existence of large, densely populated cities that are infested by mosquitoes such as Culex and the highly anthropophilic Aedes aegypti. Infected humans or animals may come into these cities from ecological-epidemiological settings where arbovirus zoonoses occur. This study analyzes the risk of emergence of the alphaviruses Mayaro, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, Eastern equine encephalitis and Chikungunya; the flaviviruses yellow fever, Rocio, Saint Louis encephalitis and West Nile; and the orthobunyavirus Oropouche.

AB  - In 1964, Dasmann suggested that “outside assistance from the more fortunately situated lands” should be forthcoming to better protect and manage wildlife in the tropics. Since then, just this has happened and there are now far-reaching international conventions which seek to categorize and track the state of the world’s wildlife and biodiversity, regulate and monitor its trade and, above all, protect it. These and many other relevant conventions are now complemented by national and regional regulations, along with countless networks, global warning systems and information platforms. This chapter describes the growing scale of this global venture around wildlife and biodiversity, alongside the shift towards a view which recognises the human rights and needs of hundreds of millions of forest-dependant people. It also shows that wildlife conservation is no longer owned by the West and that many tropical nations have taken leadership within their own borders. A diverse, at times clashing, often collaborative environment around wildlife and biodiversity management has developed, where the role of the nation-state is in general decline, where there are a multitude of international agreements and where industry vies with civil society for implementation (and control). This chapter concludes that while much of the above action is laudable, it does not appear to have been enough to halt the decline of wildlife and natural ecosystems around the tropical world. Hope though now lies with a potential game changer in the action around climate change and the creation of forest carbon markets. Whether this will be enough however is open to debate. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2016.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation commonly influences distribution of zoonotic disease reservoirs. In Panama, populations of rodent hosts of hantaviruses are favored by small habitat fragments isolated by agricultural lands. We expected a similar relationship between landscape characteristics and host distribution at fine geographical scales in southern Panama. The relative abundance of Zygodontomys brevicauda, the primary host for "Calabazo" virus, and other rodents was assessed at 24 sites within the Azuero Peninsula. We used satellite imagery to produce several spatial variables that described landscape; however, only slope was consistently related to abundances of the two most dominant rodent species. Using regression, we constructed a spatial model of areas of Z. brevicauda dominance, which in turn relates to higher infection rates. The model predicts highest abundances of Z. brevicauda in flat areas, where humans also dominate. These predictions have important ecological and conservation implications that associate diversity loss, topography, and human land use.

AB  - Monkeypox virus (MPXV) is the etiological agent of human (MPX). It is an emerging orthopoxvirus zoonosis in the tropical rain forest of Africa and is endemic in the Congo-basin and sporadic inWest Africa; it remains a tropical neglected disease of persons in impoverished rural areas. Interaction of the human population with wildlife increases human infection with MPX virus (MPXV), and infection from human to human is possible. Smallpox vaccination provides good cross-protection against MPX; however, the vaccination campaign ended in Africa in 1980,meaning that a large proportion of the population is currently unprotected against MPXV infection. Disease control hinges on deterring zoonotic exposure to the virus and, barring that, interrupting person-to-person spread. However, there are no FDA-approved therapies againstMPX, and current vaccines are limited due to safety concerns. For this reason, new studies on pathogenesis, prophylaxis and therapeutics are still of great interest, not only for the scientific community but also for the governments concerned that MPXV could be used as a bioterror agent. In the present study, a new vaccination strategy approach based on three recombinant bovine herpesvirus 4 (BoHV-4) vectors, each expressing different MPXV glycoproteins, A29L, M1R and B6R were investigated in terms of protection from a lethal MPXV challenge in STAT1 knockout mice. BoHV-4-A-CMV-A29LgD106ΔTK, BoHV-4- A-EF1α-M1RgD106ΔTK and BoHV-4-A-EF1α-B6RgD106ΔTK were successfully constructed by recombineering, and their capacity to express their transgene was demonstrated. A small challenge study was performed, and all three recombinant BoHV-4 appeared safe (no weightloss or obvious adverse events) following intraperitoneal administration. Further, BoHV-4-AEF1α- M1RgD106ΔTK alone or in combination with BoHV-4-A-CMV-A29LgD106ΔTK and BoHV-4-A-EF1α-B6RgD106ΔTK, was shown to be able to protect, 100%alone and 80%in combination, STAT1(-/-) mice against mortality and morbidity. This work demonstrated the efficacy of BoHV-4 based vectors and the use of BoHV-4 as a vaccine-vector platform. © 2015 Franceschi et al.

AB  - Rising temperatures, a widespread consequence of climate change, have been implicated in enigmatic amphibian declines from habitats with little apparent human impact. The pathogenic fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), now widespread in Neotropical mountains, may act in synergy with climate change causing collapse in thermally stressed hosts. We measured the thermal tolerance of frogs along a wide elevational gradient in the Tropical Andes, where frog populations have collapsed. We used the difference between critical thermal maximum and the temperature a frog experiences in nature as a measure of tolerance to high temperatures. Temperature tolerance increased as elevation increased, suggesting that frogs at higher elevations may be less sensitive to rising temperatures. We tested the alternative pathogen optimal growth hypothesis that prevalence of the pathogen should decrease as temperatures fall outside the optimal range of pathogen growth. Our infection-prevalence data supported the pathogen optimal growth hypothesis because we found that prevalence of Bd increased when host temperatures matched its optimal growth range. These findings suggest that rising temperatures may not be the driver of amphibian declines in the eastern slopes of the Andes. Zoonotic outbreaks of Bd are the most parsimonious hypothesis to explain the collapse of montane amphibian faunas; but our results also reveal that lowland tropical amphibians, despite being shielded from Bd by higher temperatures, are vulnerable to climate-warming stress. © 2013 Society for Conservation Biology.

AB  - The leishmaniases are protozoan, zoonotic diseases transmitted to human and other mammal hosts by the bite of phlebotomine sandflies. Bolivia has the highest incidence of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) in Latin America (LA), with 33 cases per 100,000 population reported in 2006. CL is endemic in seven of the country's nine administrative depart-ments. Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is comparatively rare and is restricted to one single focus. Most CL cases are caused by Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis (85% cases); VL is caused by L. (L.) infantum. Seven sandfly species are incriminated as vectors and Leishmania infections have been detected in several non-human mammal hosts. Transmission is associated with forest-related activities, but recently, cases of autochthonous, urban transmission were reported. Because most cases are caused by L. (V.) braziliensis, Bolivia reports the greatest ratio (i.e., up to 20% of all cases) of mucosal leishmaniasis to localized CL cases in LA. Per national guidelines, both CL and VL cases are microscopically diagnosed and treated with pentavalent antimony. Copyright ©2009 by The American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.

AB  - The natural transmission cycle of Yellow Fever (YF) involves tree hole breeding mosquitoes and a wide array of nonhuman primates (NHP), including monkeys and apes. Some Neotropical monkeys (howler monkeys, genus Alouatta) develop fatal YF virus (YFV) infections similar to those reported in humans, even with minimum exposure to the infection. Epizootics in wild primates may be indicating YFV circulation, and the surveillance of such outbreaks in wildlife is an important tool to help prevent human infection. In 2001, surveillance activities successfully identified YF-related death in a black-and-gold howler monkey (Alouatta caraya), Rio Grande do Sul State (RGS) in southern Brazil, and the YFV was isolated from a species of forest-dwelling mosquito (Haemagogus leucocelaenus). These findings led the State Secretariat of Health to initiate a monitoring program for YF and other 18 arboviral infections in Alouatta monkeys. The monitoring program included monkey captures, reporting of monkey casualties by municipalities, and subsequent investigations. If monkey carcasses were found in forests, samples were collected in a standardized manner and this practice resulted in increased reporting of outbreaks. In October 2008, a single howler monkey in a northwestern RGS municipality was confirmed to have died from YF. From October 2008 to June 2009, 2,013 monkey deaths were reported (830 A. caraya and 1,183 A. guariba clamitans). Viruses isolation in blood, viscera, and/or immunohistochemistry led to the detection of YF in 204 of 297 (69%) (154 A. g. clamitans and 50 A. caraya) dead Alouatta monkeys tested. The number of municipalities with confirmed YFV circulation in howlers increased from 2 to 67 and 21 confirmed human cases occurred. This surveillance system was successful in identifying the largest YF outbreak affecting wild NHP ever recorded. Am. J. Primatol. 74:68-76, 2012. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Background:Environmental transmission of the zoonotic parasite Toxoplasma gondii, which is shed only by felids, poses risks to human and animal health in temperate and tropical ecosystems. Atypical T. gondii genotypes have been linked to severe disease in people and the threatened population of California sea otters. To investigate land-to-sea parasite transmission, we screened 373 carnivores (feral domestic cats, mountain lions, bobcats, foxes, and coyotes) for T. gondii infection and examined the distribution of genotypes in 85 infected animals sampled near the sea otter range.Methodology/Principal Findings:Nested PCR-RFLP analyses and direct DNA sequencing at six independent polymorphic genetic loci (B1, SAG1, SAG3, GRA6, L358, and Apico) were used to characterize T. gondii strains in infected animals. Strains consistent with Type X, a novel genotype previously identified in over 70% of infected sea otters and four terrestrial wild carnivores along the California coast, were detected in all sampled species, including domestic cats. However, odds of Type X infection were 14 times higher (95% CI: 1.3-148.6) for wild felids than feral domestic cats. Type X infection was also linked to undeveloped lands (OR = 22, 95% CI: 2.3-250.7). A spatial cluster of terrestrial Type II infection (P = 0.04) was identified in developed lands bordering an area of increased risk for sea otter Type II infection. Two spatial clusters of animals infected with strains consistent with Type X (P≤0.01) were detected in less developed landscapes.Conclusions:Differences in T. gondii genotype prevalence among domestic and wild felids, as well as the spatial distribution of genotypes, suggest co-existing domestic and wild T. gondii transmission cycles that likely overlap at the interface of developed and undeveloped lands. Anthropogenic development driving contact between these cycles may increase atypical T. gondii genotypes in domestic cats and facilitate transmission of potentially more pathogenic genotypes to humans, domestic animals, and wildlife.

AB  - Anthropogenic habitat alteration has the capacity to alter the distribution of species. Capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) are a widely distributed rodent throughout most of South America, but are restricted to areas of standing water. As the Gran Chaco ecosystem of Paraguay is converted from dry tropical forest to pastureland, we hypothesize that this alteration creates potential for invasion by capybara into newly fragmented areas. We surveyed throughout the Chaco to estimate the distribution of capybara, and we collected noninvasive genetic samples. We used ecological niche modeling based on six environmental or climatic variables, and we modeled both the current distribution of capybara and the distribution of capybara 80 years ago. We then verified the hypothesized demographic signal generated with our model using phylogeographic analyses of 386 bp of the mtDNA control region. Comparison of present and past models suggested that populations expanded into the Gran Chaco after forest was converted to pastureland. Analyses of the mitochondrial D-loop supported the rapid range expansion scenario. We also found evidence of secondary contact of two distinct phylogroups which had previously been disjunct. Anthropogenic land transformation appeared to be a major factor influencing the distribution, as predicted by the niche model and confirmed by genetic data. Habitat modification altered connectivity of populations across the landscape. In addition, long separated clades of capybara are now admixed throughout the Paraguayan Chaco. The invasion of a large bodied herbivore into the High Chaco region may exacerbate the degradation of forest and prevent forest regeneration. As the reservoir host of several zoonotic diseases, the expansion and contact of two previously disjunct capybara populations has implications for disease emergence. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Introduction: Plasmodium knowlesi has long been present in Malaysia, and is now an emerging cause of zoonotic human malaria. Cases have been confirmed throughout South-East Asia where the ranges of its natural macaque hosts and Anopheles leucosphyrus group vectors overlap. The majority of cases are from Eastern Malaysia, with increasing total public health notifications despite a concurrent reduction in Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax malaria. The public health implications are concerning given P. knowlesi has the highest risk of severe and fatal disease of all Plasmodium spp in Malaysia. Current patterns of risk and disease vary based on vector type and competence, with individual exposure risks related to forest and forest-edge activities still poorly defined. Clustering of cases has not yet been systematically evaluated despite reports of peri-domestic transmission and known vector competence for human-to-human transmission. Methods and analysis: A population-based case-control study will be conducted over a 2-year period at two adjacent districts in north-west Sabah, Malaysia. Confirmed malaria cases presenting to the district hospital sites meeting relevant inclusion criteria will be requested to enrol. Three community controls matched to the same village as the case will be selected randomly. Study procedures will include blood sampling and administration of household and individual questionnaires to evaluate potential exposure risks associated with acquisition of P. knowlesi malaria. Secondary outcomes will include differences in exposure variables between P. knowlesi and other Plasmodium spp, risk of severe P. knowlesi malaria, and evaluation of P. knowlesi case clustering. Primary analysis will be per protocol, with adjusted ORs for exposure risks between cases and controls calculated using conditional multiple logistic regression models. Ethics: This study has been approved by the human research ethics committees of Malaysia, the Menzies School of Health Research, Australia, and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, UK.

AB  - The Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), an arthropod-born Flavivirus, is the major cause of viral encephalitis, responsible for 10,000-15,000 deaths each year, yet is a neglected tropical disease. Since the JEV distribution area has been large and continuously extending toward new Asian and Australasian regions, it is considered an emerging and reemerging pathogen. Despite large effective immunization campaigns, Japanese encephalitis remains a disease of global health concern. JEV zoonotic transmission cycles may be either wild or domestic: the first involves wading birds as wild amplifying hosts; the second involves pigs as the main domestic amplifying hosts. Culex mosquito species, especially Cx. tritaeniorhynchus, are the main competent vectors. Although five JEV genotypes circulate, neither clear-cut genotype-phenotype relationship nor clear variations in genotype fitness to hosts or vectors have been identified. Instead, the molecular epidemiology appears highly dependent on vectors, hosts' biology, and on a set of environmental factors. At global scale, climate, land cover, and land use, otherwise strongly dependent on human activities, affect the abundance of JEV vectors, and of wild and domestic hosts. Chiefly, the increase of rice-cultivated surface, intensively used by wading birds, and of pig production in Asia has provided a high availability of resources to mosquito vectors, enhancing the JEV maintenance, amplification, and transmission. At fine scale, the characteristics (density, size, spatial arrangement) of three landscape elements (paddy fields, pig farms, human habitations) facilitate or impede movement of vectors, then determine how the JEV interacts with hosts and vectors and ultimately the infection risk to humans. If the JEV is introduced in a favorable landscape, either by live infected animals or by vectors, then the virus can emerge and become a major threat for human health. Multidisciplinary research is essential to shed light on the biological mechanisms involved in the emergence, spread, reemergence, and genotypic changes of JEV. © 2013 Le Flohic et al.

AB  - The literature regarding the diversity of ectoparasites and their interaction with their hosts remains largely inadequate in Malaysian tropical rainforest. We investigate the interaction patterns and specialization of ectoparasites infesting terrestrial small mammals (rodents and scandents) in Peninsular and Malaysian Borneo from samples made in 16 localities between 2008 and 2010. A total of 3,235 individuals of ectoparasites were collected during field surveys, resulting in an interaction network involving 47 ectoparasites that were distributed on 23 species of small mammals. The overall specialization index H of all ectoparasites and host species was 0.67 which was considered moderate. Ticks appeared to be generalist with specialization index (H= 0.35) while lice showed higher specialization (H = 1) in selecting host species. The most diverse parasite assemblage was found on S. muelleri (H= 1.96). Specialization indices among ectoparasite species (d) ranged from 0.03 to 1 while the indices among host species (d) ranged from 0.20 to 1. Incomplete field data may have contributed to the high specialization indices. This study is significant as it can enhance our understanding the emergence and management of potential zoonotic diseases in Malaysia.

AB  - Three hundred and fifty-five rodents of 15 species were trapped in six tropical habitats in northern Australia. Their pathology and the associated microbiology and helminthology of potential zoonotic importance were examined. Eleven Salmonella strains of 9 different serotypes were isolated from the caecal or rectal faeces, an incidence of 3.1%. Three strains of Ps. pseudomallei and one of Ps. aeruginosa were recovered. Twelve (8.8%) of 136 rodent sera examined had complement-fixing antibody at significant titres to Ps. pseudomallei. Ten of these sera were from animals in the endemic Townsville region. Evidence of leptospirosis was obtained from 23 (6.4%) of the rodents. Fifteen strains were being actively excreted and 12 (3.5%) of the infected animals had significant levels of agglutinins. R. fuscipes was an important host of L. celledoni in rain-forest. L. australis was isolated from H. chrysogaster for the first time in Australia. Rodent leptospirosis appeared to be most prevalent in areas of high rainfall, particularly rain-forest, but was rarely encountered in the towns. One hundred and eighty-five rodents and their ectoparasites were examined for the presence of R. tsutsugamushi, R. australis, R. mooseri and C. burneti. Three strains of R. tsutsugamushi were isolated from the tissues of 3 groups of rodents and their habitats identified as potential sources of scrub typhus. Ectoparasites proved to be free of R. tsutsugamushi and a known vector mite of scrub typhus in Australia, L. deliense, was not present on rodents in groups infected with rickettsiae. R. australis, R. mooseri and C. burneti were not detected in any of the material and the rodent sera showed no evidence of previous infection. Two rodent populations, both resident at a city harbour were found to be infected with T. gondii. Of 291 rodents investigated, 24% were infected with helminths of zoonotic potential, notably Hymenolepis nana and H. diminuta.

AB  - Cryptosporidium is an important zoonotic parasite globally. Few studies have examined the ecology and epidemiology of this pathogen in rural tropical systems characterized by high rates of overlap among humans, domesticated animals, and wildlife. We investigated risk factors for Cryptosporidium infection and assessed cross-species transmission potential among people, non-human primates, and domestic animals in the Gombe Ecosystem, Kigoma District, Tanzania. A cross-sectional survey was designed to determine the occurrence and risk factors for Cryptosporidium infection in humans, domestic animals and wildlife living in and around Gombe National Park. Diagnostic PCR revealed Cryptosporidium infection rates of 4.3% in humans, 16.0% in non-human primates, and 9.6% in livestock. Local streams sampled were negative. DNA sequencing uncovered a complex epidemiology for Cryptosporidium in this system, with humans, baboons and a subset of chimpanzees infected with C. hominis subtype IfA12G2; another subset of chimpanzees infected with C. suis; and all positive goats and sheep infected with C. xiaoi. For humans, residence location was associated with increased risk of infection in Mwamgongo village compared to one camp (Kasekela), and there was an increased odds for infection when living in a household with another positive person. Fecal consistency and other gastrointestinal signs did not predict Cryptosporidium infection. Despite a high degree of habitat overlap between village people and livestock, our results suggest that there are distinct Cryptosporidium transmission dynamics for humans and livestock in this system. The dominance of C. hominis subtype IfA12G2 among humans and non-human primates suggest cross-species transmission. Interestingly, a subset of chimpanzees was infected with C. suis. We hypothesize that there is cross-species transmission from bush pigs (Potaochoerus larvatus) to chimpanzees in Gombe forest, since domesticated pigs are regionally absent. Our findings demonstrate a complex nature of Cryptosporidium in sympatric primates, including humans, and stress the need for further studies.

AB  - Purpose of review Determining the viral cause of a rash presents significant diagnostic challenges. We review contemporary literature on viral exanthems and suggest a structured approach to aid diagnosis. Recent findings Strains responsible for, and the clinical presentation of, enteroviral infections have diverged from classic descriptions. The causative relationship between antibiotic administration and rash in Epstein-Barr virus infection has been recently questioned. Major measles virus outbreaks have recently occurred in Europe and the USA. The largest Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa has resulted in importation of the virus to other countries and secondary local transmission. Autochthonous transmission of Chikungunya virus has occurred in nonendemic areas, including Europe, the Caribbean and Americas. Zika virus has re-emerged in the Pacific with local transmission from imported cases. Climate change, global warming and spillover of zoonotic viruses are contributing to the emergence and spread of viral diseases. Summary Important clues to the diagnosis of viral exanthems include their distribution and morphology, geographic location and potential exposure to vector-borne or blood-borne viruses. Diagnosis is commonly made via serology, nucleic acid tests or, rarely, viral culture. Skin biopsy is not usually required. In general, viral exanthems are self-limiting and treatment is supportive.

AB  - Hunting and loss of natural habitats increasingly threaten tropical biodiversity and ecosystems, particularly in Southeast Asia. Flying foxes often persist in anthropogenic areas where other wildlife has vanished, and where they play a significant ecological role in vegetation regeneration in disturbed habitats. Detailed knowledge on the foraging behavior of flying foxes is crucial for understanding how they survive in degraded habitats and for the management of human-wildlife conflicts. Thailand still harbors large colonies (several thousand individuals) of Lyle's flying fox (Pteropus lylei), a species ranked as Vulnerable on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List, at temples situated in agricultural landscapes. We used high-resolution global positioning system (GPS) loggers to study the movement and foraging behavior of this species at 2 temples in central Thailand during 2 seasons. We analyzed GPS and acceleration data of 19 tagged individuals, and assessed habitat use and diet. Foraging individuals commuted between day roosts and foraging areas each night, followed by small-scale movements in foraging areas, and showed high site fidelity during the study period. Maximum linear distances between day roosts and foraging areas varied greatly between individuals (2.2-23.6km) but were similar between seasons. Tracked bats mostly foraged in farmland, plantations, and gardens, yet our data indicate that small mangrove remnants constitute important habitat components for Lyle's flying fox. We recorded a highly diverse diet of 34 food plant species, comprised of exotic crops and native plants as available. Our results suggest that conservation and landscape managers should preserve remaining native trees and natural vegetation in the study area as resources for Lyle's flying fox, at the same time reducing potential for conflicts between bats and humans on crops. They can further be used for public information campaigns integrating the potential of Lyle's flying fox as dispersers of useful plants and the human health risks through zoonotic diseases associated with hunting and consumption of this species. © 2015 The Wildlife Society. © The Wildlife Society, 2015.

AB  - From 1998 through 2006, 44 cases of severe primary toxoplasmosis were observed in French Guiana in immunocompetent adults. Toxoplasma gondii isolates exhibited an atypical multilocus genotype. Severe disease in humans may result from poor host adaptation to neotropical zoonotic strains of T. gondii circulating in a forest-based cycle.

AB  - During the course of the recently concluded smallpox eradication program, a new human orthopoxvirus infection was discovered which is caused by monkeypox virus. The disease occurs sporadically in remote villages within tropical rain forests of West and Central Africa. The disease is rare; only 155 cases having been reported from 1970 to 1983. The symptoms and signs of human monkeypox resemble those of smallpox, differing significantly only in the occurrence of lymphadenopathy with human monkeypox disease. Of 155 cases, some 80% are believed to have resulted from infection from an as yet unknown animal reservoir; the rest occurred among unvaccinated close contacts among whom a secondary attack rate of 15% was observed. Although person-to-person spread appears to have occurred in some instances, few cases were observed in the third or fourth generation of transmission and none thereafter. Since 1982, the incidence of human monkeypox infections in Zaire has increased concomitant with an intensified surveillance program. Additional reasons which might explain the increased incidence are discussed. Further surveillance and research of this primary zoonotic infection are warranted and are in progress.

AB  - Toxoplasmosis, leishmaniasis and hydatidosis are the most neglected, an important public health problem and of economic importance, affecting largely the poorest of the poor, mainly in developing countries. Toxoplasmosis is a problematic zoonosis, particularly in vulnerable groups such as pregnant women and immunodeficient patients. Toxoplasma gondii was first isolated in the early 1900s from an African rodent (i.e. Ctenodactylus gundi). Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular protozoan parasite, infecting humans and almost all warm-blooded animals. Toxoplasmosis is the most common disease complication, next to tuberculosis, among HIV seropositive admissions and deaths in Ethiopia. Leishmaniasis is a major vector-borne disease caused by obligate intramacrophage protozoa of the genus Leishmania and transmitted by the bite of phlebotomine female sand flies. Currently, leishmaniasis shows a wider geographic distribution and increased global incidence. Environmental, demographic and human behaviors contribute to the changing landscape for zoonotic cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis. The primary reservoir hosts of Leishmania are sylvatic mammals such as forest rodents, hyraxes and wild canids and dogs are the most important species among domesticated animals in the epidemiology. HIV/AIDS co-infection in the north-western, visceral leishmaniasis focus in Ethiopia has the highest known HIV co-infection rate in the world. Hydatidosis is a major parasitic disease caused by the larval stage of the dog tapeworm Echinococcus granulosus and is characterized by the formation of single or multiple cysts (hydatid cysts) varying in size. Dogs are particularly important in zoonotic transmission due to their close relationships with humans. Ethiopia has been noted for a high prevalence of hydatid disease since 1970s during which it was reported that the disease occurs in all parts of the country. Likewise, studies conducted recently in abattoirs of various locations have indicated that hydatidosis is widespread in Ethiopia with great economic and public health significance. Therefore, it is highly imperative public health education to build up public awareness about the sources of infection, control and prevention method for overcoming neglected tropical diseases. © IDOSI Publications, 2014.

AB  - This report provides a review and analysis of the research landscape for zoonoses and marginalized infections which affect poor populations, and a list of research priorities to support disease control. The work is the output of the Disease Reference Group on Zoonoses and Marginalized Infectious Diseases of Poverty (DRG6), which is part of an independent think tank of international experts, established and funded by the Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR), to identify key research priorities through review of research evidence and input from stakeholder consultations. The report covers a diverse range of diseases, including zoonotic helminth, protozoan, viral and bacterial infections considered to be neglected and associated with poverty. Disease-specific research issues are elaborated under individual disease sections and many common priorities are identified among the diseases such as the need for new and/or improved drugs and regimens, diagnostics and, where appropriate, vaccines. The disease-specific priorities are described as micro priorities compared with the macro level priorities which will drive policy-making for: improved surveillance; interaction between the health, livestock, agriculture, natural resources and wildlife sectors in tackling zoonotic diseases; and true assessment of the burden of zoonoses. This is one often disease and thematic reference group reports that have come out of the TDR Think Tank, all of which have contributed to the development of the Global Report search on Infectious Diseases of Poverty, available at: w.who.int/tdr/stewardship/global_report/en/index.html.

We conducted a cross-sectional study of G. duodenalis in people, livestock, and wild primates near Kibale National Park, Uganda, where human-livestock-wildlife interaction is high due to habitat disturbance. Our goal was to infer the cross-species transmission potential of G. duodenalis using molecular methods and to investigate clinical consequences of infection. Methodology/Principal Findings: Real-time PCR on DNA extracted from fecal samples revealed a combined prevalence of G. duodenalis in people from three villages of 44/108 (40.7%), with prevalence reaching 67.5% in one village. Prevalence rates in livestock and primates were 12.4% and 11.1%, respectively. Age was associated with G. duodenalis infection in people (higher prevalence in individuals ≤15 years) and livestock (higher prevalence in subadult versus adult animals), but other potential risk factors in people (gender, contact with domestic animals, working in fields, working in forests, source of drinking water, and medication use) were not. G. duodenalis infection was not associated with gastrointestinal symptoms in people, nor was clinical disease noted in livestock or primates. Sequence analysis of four G. duodenalis genes identified assemblage AII in humans, assemblage BIV in humans and endangered red colobus monkeys, and assemblage E in livestock and red colobus, representing the first documentation of assemblage E in a non-human primate. In addition, genetic relationships within the BIV assemblage revealed sub-clades of identical G. duodenalis sequences from humans and red colobus. Conclusions/Significance: Our finding of G. duodenalis in people and primates (assemblage BIV) and livestock and primates (assemblage E) underscores that cross-species transmission of multiple G. duodenalis assemblages may occur in locations such as western Uganda where people, livestock, and primates overlap in their use of habitat. Our data also demonstrate a high but locally variable prevalence of G. duodenalis in people from western Uganda, but little evidence of associated clinical disease. Reverse zoonotic G. duodenalis transmission may be particularly frequent in tropical settings where anthropogenic habitat disturbance forces people and livestock to interact at high rates with wildlife, and this could have negative consequences for wildlife conservation. © 2010 Johnston et al.

AB  - How do animals use their habitat? Where do they go and what do they do? These basic questions are key not only to understanding a species' ecology and evolution, but also for addressing many of the environmental challenges we currently face, including problems posed by invasive species, the spread of zoonotic diseases and declines in wildlife populations due to anthropogenic climate and land-use changes. Monitoring the movements and activities of wild animals can be difficult, especially when the species in question are small, cryptic or move over large areas. In this paper, we describe an Automated Radio-Telemetry System (ARTS) that we designed and built on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama to overcome these challenges. We describe the hardware and software we used to implement the ARTS, and discuss the scientific successes we have had using the system, as well as the logistical challenges we faced in maintaining the system in real-world, rainforest conditions. The ARTS uses automated radio-telemetry receivers mounted on 40-m towers topped with arrays of directional antennas to track the activity and location of radio-collared study animals, 24 h a day, 7 days a week. These receiving units are connected by a wireless network to a server housed in the laboratory on BCI, making these data available in real time to researchers via a web-accessible database. As long as study animals are within the range of the towers, the ARTS system collects data more frequently than typical animal-borne global positioning system collars (∼12 locations/h) with lower accuracy (approximately 50 m) but at much reduced cost per tag (∼10X less expensive). The geographic range of ARTS, like all VHF telemetry, is affected by the size of the radio-tag as well as its position in the forest (e.g. tags in the canopy transmit farther than those on the forest floor). We present a model of signal propagation based on landscape conditions, which quantifies these effects and identifies sources of interference, including weather events and human activity. ARTS has been used to track 374 individual animals from 38 species, including 17 mammal species, 12 birds, 7 reptiles or amphibians, as well as two species of plant seeds. These data elucidate the spatio-temporal dynamics of animal activity and movement at the site and have produced numerous peer-reviewed publications, student theses, magazine articles, educational programs and film documentaries. These data are also relevant to long-term population monitoring and conservation plans. Both the successes and the failures of the ARTS system are applicable to broader sensor network applications and are valuable for advancing sensor network research. © The Author 2011.

AB  - There are two main groups of biological agents regarded as occupational hazards: allergenic and/or toxic agents forming bioaerosols, and agents causing zoonoses and other infectious diseases. Bioaerosols occurring in the agricultural work environments comprise: bacteria, fungi, high molecular polymers produced by bacteria (endotoxin) or by fungi (β-glucans), low molecular secondary metabolites of fungi (mycotoxins, volatile organic compounds) and various particles of plant and animal origin. All these agents could be a cause of allergic and/or immunotoxic occupational diseases of respiratory organ (airways inflammation, rhinitis, toxic pneumonitis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis and asthma), conjunctivitis and dermatitis in exposed workers. Very important among zoonotic agents causing occupational diseases are those causing tick-borne diseases: Lyme borreliosis, anaplasmosis, babesiosis, bartonellosis. Agricultural workers in tropical zones are exposed to mosquito bites causing malaria, the most prevalent vector-borne disease in the world. The group of agents causing other, basically not vector-borne zoonoses, comprises those evoking emerging or re-emerging diseases of global concern, such as: hantaviral diseases, avian and swine influenza, Q fever, leptospiroses, staphylococcal diseases caused by the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains, and diseases caused by parasitic protozoa. Among other infectious, non-zoonotic agents, the greatest hazard for health care workers pose the blood-borne human hepatitis and immunodeficiency viruses (HBV, HCV, HIV). Of interest are also bacteria causing legionellosis in people occupationally exposed to droplet aerosols, mainly from warm water.

AB  - Transboundary zoonotic diseases, several of which are vector borne, can maintain a dynamic focus and have pathogens circulating in geographic regions encircling multiple geopolitical boundaries. Global change is intensifying transboundary problems, including the spatial variation of the risk and incidence of zoonotic diseases.The complexity of these challenges can be greater in areas where rivers delineate international boundaries and encompass transitions between ecozones.The Rio Grande serves as a natural border between the US State ofTexas and the Mexican States of Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo León, andTamaulipas. Not only do millions of people live in this transboundary region, but also a substantial amount of goods and people pass through it everyday. Moreover, it occurs over a region that functions as a corridor for animal migrations, and thus links the Neotropic and Nearctic biogeographic zones, with the latter being a known foci of zoonotic diseases. However, the pathogenic landscape of important zoonotic diseases in the southTexas-Mexico transboundary region remains to be fully understood. An international perspective on the interplay between disease systems, ecosystem processes, land use, and human behaviors is applied here to analyze landscape and spatial features of Venezuelan equine encephalitis, Hantavirus disease, Lyme Borreliosis, Leptospirosis, Bartonellosis, Chagas disease, human Babesiosis, and Leishmaniasis. Surveillance systems following the One Health approach with a regional perspective will help identifying opportunities to mitigate the health burden of those diseases on human and animal populations. It is proposed that the Mexico-US border along the Rio Grande region be viewed as a continuum landscape where zoonotic pathogens circulate regardless of national borders. © 2014 Esteve-Gassent, Pérez de León, Romero-Salas, Feria-Arroyo, Patino, Castro-Arellano, Gordillo-Pérez, Auclair , Goolsby, Rodriguez-Vivas and Estrada Franco.

AB  - Ecological community structure is particularly important in vector-borne zoonotic diseases with complex life cycles. Qualitative community model analysis may provide a meaningful alternative to standard population-based models of vector-borne disease. We built on recent mathematical developments in qualitative community modeling coupled with conventional biomathematical models of vector-borne disease transmission, to provide a procedure to analyze risk. Using this procedure, we can hypothesize changes in risk of vector-borne disease from disturbances, such as control measures, habitat alteration, or global warming. We demonstrate the application of this procedure to an oak forest community to predict the risk of Lyme disease. Our predictions of Lyme disease risk in an oak forest community confirm reports of positive associations between deer abundance and risk of disease and are consistent with published observations. © 2004 Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.

AB  - The role of Didelphis marsupialis as a reservoir of zoonotic hemoflagellates was examined in two ecologically distinct settings in Colombia. While 72% (12 of 18) of the opossums collected in the tropical rain forest harbored Trypanosoma cruzi, other mammals in the area had lower infection rates: 1.3% (Proechymis semispinosus [spiny rat]; 13% Tylomys mirae [climbing rat]: and 6% Rattus rattus). Trypanosoma cruzi isolates from D. marsupialis were similar to zymodeme 1 (Z1), and two of four phenotypes were shared with Tylomys mirae, which is also predominantly arboreal. Terrestrial (P. semispinosus) and peridomestic (R. rattus) animals were infected with Z3 or other Z1 phenotypes, respectively. Schizodeme analysis showed polymorphisms among isolates from mammals, reflecting diverse modes of transmission, and a complex epidemiologic situation. Despite the lower infection rate of the opossum (14%) found in our study in the tropical dry forest as compared with the tropical wet forest, Chagas' disease has been reported only in the former area. This suggests that the lack of alternative blood sources for triafomines of the tropical dry forest, where mammals are less abundant than in the wet forest, may increase the risk of human infection. Among several species of mammals captured in the tropical dry forest. Leishmania chagasi was isolated from 22.7% (5 of 22) D. marsupialis. This finding confirms the important role of opossums in Colombian foci of visceral leishmaniasis, including those where the phlebotomine species involved in transmission is Lutzomyia evansi, an alternative vector to the more common Lutzomyia longipalpis.

AB  - Background: Land-use change has led to a dramatic decrease in total forest cover, contributing to biodiversity loss and changes of ecosystems' functions. Insect communities of medical importance can be favored by anthropogenic alterations, increasing the risk of novel zoonotic diseases. The response of mosquito (Diptera: Culicidae) abundance and richness to five land-use types (shade coffee plantation, cattle field, urban forest, peri-urban forest, well-preserved montane cloud forest) and three seasons ("dry", "rainy" and "cold") embedded in a neotropical montane cloud forest landscape was evaluated. Methods: Standardized collections were performed using 8 CDC miniature black-light traps, baited with CO2 throughout the year. Generalized additive mixed models were used to describe the seasonal and spatial trends of both species richness and abundance. Rank abundance curves and ANCOVAs were used to detect changes in the spatial and temporal structure of the mosquito assemblage. Two cluster analyses were conducted, using 1-βsim and the Morisita-Horn index to evaluate species composition shifts based on incidences and abundances. Results: A total of 2536 adult mosquitoes were collected, belonging to 9 genera and 10 species; the dominant species in the study were: Aedes quadrivittatus, Wyeomyia adelpha, Wy. arthrostigma, and Culex restuans. Highest richness was recorded in the dry season, whereas higher abundance was detected during the rainy season. The urban forest had the highest species richness (n = 7) when compared to all other sites. Species composition cluster analyses show that there is a high degree of similarity in species numbers across sites and seasons throughout the year. However, when considering the abundance of such species, the well-preserved montane cloud forest showed significantly higher abundance. Moreover, the urban forest is only 30 % similar to other sites in terms of species abundances, indicating a possible isolating role of the urban environment. Conclusion: Mosquito assemblage was differentially influenced by land-use change and seasonality, but at the same time the assemblage is rather homogeneous across the studied landscape, suggesting a high degree of spatial connectivity. Information generated in this study is potentially useful in the development of urban planning and surveillance programs focused mainly on mosquito species of medical and veterinary importance. © 2015 Abella-Medrano et al.

AB  - Aims: Leptospirosis is endemic to tropical regions of the world and is re-emerging as a new danger to public health in Southeast Asia, including Malaysia. The purpose of this particular study was to determine the common leptospiral serovars present in small wild mammals living around wildlife reserves and disturbed forest habitats and human communities. Methodology and results: The samples of blood and kidneys of small rodents, bats and squirrels were analyzed. Antibodies to different serovars of leptospires were detected in 73 of 155 wild small mammals captured (47.0%: 95% CI 39.0-55.3%). The seroprevalence for rats (57.9%; 95% CI 44.1-70.9) was slightly higher than that for squirrels (42.9%; 95% CI 24.5-62.8) and bats (40%; 95% CI 28.5-52.4). Seropositive animals were detected in all 5 localities sampled. Antibodies to serovar Lepto 175 Sarawak were detected in 30 (24.7%) rats, 11 (9.0%) squirrels and 27 (52.9%) bats. Of 155 kidney samples from individual animals only 17 were positive for Leptospira on a molecular study (10.97%, 95% CI 6.5-17). The majority of the positive results were from plantain squirrels (53%; 95% CI 27.8, 77), Müller's rat (35%; 95% CI 14.2, 61.7) and brown spiny rats (12%; 95% CI 1.5, 36.4). Conclusion, significance and impact of study: This particular study should generate concerns and lead to the health authorities expanding disease control measures in the region as there are significant levels of human activity at all five locations where the animals were sampled. The pathogenesis of serovar Lepto 175 Sarawak also needs to be monitored closely, considering its similarities to the pathogenic Leptospira wolffii.

AB  - This paper reviews the evolutionary and natural history of malarias; it is proposed that all human malarial parasites originated from zoonotic simian plasmodiids in tropical forests of southeastern Asia, during the terminal Pleistocene or early Holocene. The modes of malarial transmission among prehistoric natives of that geographic area is reconstructed, based primarily on ecological, archeological and ethnographic evidence. Early Holocene hunters and food gatherers of southeastern Asia shared the same forest habitats as several mosquito members of the Anopheles leucosphyrus group, known to be efficient malarial vectors. These forest dwellers could have maintained endemic malaria, however at low levels due to their low population density. With the abundance and interactive roles in transmitting human malaria of the An. dirus and An. minimus mosquitos in forest fringe areas, the middle Holocene settled farmers occupying such habitats would have been subject all year round to highly endemic malaria. Generally much lower and less uniform transmission of the disease could have been found among early coastal occupants, in the presence of the less efficient An. sundaicus vector. Malaria was practically absent on lowland floodplains, extensively occupied by human populations since the first millennium BC onwards, due to lack of major vectors.

AB  - The report of the Rockefeller Foundation/Lancet Commission on Planetary Health described how human health directly depends upon the environment. It takes a broad perspective not only acknowledging climate change as the most important global environmental threat to health but also recognizing other impacts, including dramatic loss of tropical forests, land degradation, loss of biodiversity, declining freshwater resources, ocean acidification, and over-exploitation of fisheries. All pose challenges to human health gains, leading to the concept of planetary health-that the human condition is tied to natural systems. The Planetary Health Commission report highlights several major concerns arising from environmental change including impacts on food availability and quality, increases in natural disasters and population displacement, and newly emerging diseases, e.g. from zoonotic infections. Three challenges emerge from the report: The first is imagination, or conceptual challenges-better metrics are needed to assess human progress within the context of environmental change; the second is a lack of relevant knowledge, requiring more research on the inter-linkages between environmental change and health and on the effectiveness of potential solutions; and the third is implementation of solutions, ensuring that the science is translated into policy and practice. There are many opportunities to promote planetary health including developing sustainable and healthy cities, encouraging more resilient health systems and disaster preparedness, reducing food waste, preserving ecosystems, and redirecting harmful subsidies in food, agriculture, fishery and energy sectors. Many current trends are driven by inequitable, inefficient, and unsustainable patterns of resource consumption and technological development, coupled with population growth, but solutions lie within reach. Prosperity must be redefined as an enhancement of the quality of life and the delivery of improved health for all, together with respect for natural systems. © 2016 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Influenza A viruses that cause highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) also infect humans. In many developing countries such as Ghana, poultry and humans live in close proximity in both the general and military populations, increasing risk for the spread of HPAI from birds to humans. Respiratory infections such as influenza are especially prone to rapid spread among military populations living in close quarters such as barracks making this a key population for targeted avian influenza surveillance and public health education. Method. Twelve military barracks situated in the coastal, tropical rain forest and northern savannah belts of the country were visited and the troops and their families educated on pandemic avian influenza. Attendants at each site was obtained from the attendance sheet provided for registration. The seminars focused on zoonotic diseases, influenza surveillance, pathogenesis of avian influenza, prevention of emerging infections and biosecurity. To help direct public health policies, a questionnaire was used to collect information on animal populations and handling practices from 102 households in the military barracks. Cloacal and tracheal samples were taken from 680 domestic and domesticated wild birds and analysed for influenza A using molecular methods for virus detection. Results: Of the 1028 participants that took part in the seminars, 668 (65%) showed good knowledge of pandemic avian influenza and the risks associated with its infection. Even though no evidence of the presence of avian influenza (AI) infection was found in the 680 domestic and wild birds sampled, biosecurity in the households surveyed was very poor. Conclusion: Active surveillance revealed that there was no AI circulation in the military barracks in April 2011. Though participants demonstrated good knowledge of pandemic avian influenza, biosecurity practices were minimal. Sustained educational programs are needed to further strengthen avian influenza surveillance and prevention in military barracks. © 2012 Odoom et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Phlebotomines are the sole or principal vectors of Leishmania, Bartonella bacilliformis, and some arboviruses. The coevolution of sand flies with Leishmania species of mammals and lizards is considered in relation to the landscape epidemiology of leishmaniasis, a neglected tropical disease. Evolutionary hypotheses are unresolved, so a practical phlebotomine classification is proposed to aid biomedical information retrieval. The vectors of Leishmania are tabulated and new criteria for their incrimination are given. Research on fly-parasite-host interactions, fly saliva, and behavioral ecology is reviewed in relation to parasite manipulation of blood feeding, vaccine targets, and pheromones for lures. Much basic research is based on few transmission cycles, so generalizations should be made with caution. Integrated research and control programs have begun, but improved control of leishmaniasis and nuisance-biting requires greater emphasis on population genetics and transmission modeling. Most leishmaniasis transmission is zoonotic, affecting the poor and tourists in rural and natural areas, and therefore control should be compatible with environmental conservation. © 2013 by Annual Reviews.

AB  - Many blood-sucking arthropods are potential vectors of disease. To become a vector, the arthropod must be susceptible to the infective agent and must survive the incubation period so as to transmit the pathogens to a host. While some arthropod associated diseases affect only man (e.g. malaria) most of these diseases are (anthropo-) zoonoses with man often an accidental host. The risk of contamination depends on the one hand on the biting behaviour of the vector, its biology and distribution, and on the other hand on the sites visited by the traveller, the length of his stay, his activities, the conditions of sleeping accommodation. The risk of contracting malaria is very high in tropical Africa, in the forest area of South America and South East Asia, in Papua New Guinea. Malaria can be prevented if measures (e.g. pyrethroid impregnated bed nets, repellents) are taken to avoid bites of Anopheline mosquitoes between sunset and sunrise, but appropriate chemoprophylaxis must not be neglected. Lethal cases of yellow fever among unvaccinated travellers still occur despite a strict international regulation on vaccination requirements. Dengue is a major health problem in intertropical areas. As no vaccine is available, personal protection measures are recommended against daytime-biting mosquitoes, including the use of protective clothing, repellents. Other arthropod borne diseases among travellers are less common but the risks increase during adventure trips (e.g. zoonotic leishmaniasis, tick-borne relapsing fever) and humanitarian actions (e.g. risk of louse-borne typhus during visits of overcrowded prisons). Tick-borne diseases receive nowadays more attention. These diseases are not only restricted to some occupations (farmers, veterinarians) but also ramblers and campers are at risk. Attached ticks should be removed rapidly and carefully, since several hours of attachment are needed for transmission of spirochetes of LYME disease.

AB  - This study focuses on estimating knowledge of zoonoses among medical students and recent graduates, with an aim of understanding critical gaps in medical education with respect to zoonoses. A semi-structured tool for knowledge assessment, having nine principal domains of knowledge and five domains of practice, was developed and validated. Using this tool, cross-sectional data was collected from 364 medical students and recent graduates and knowledge scores were calculated based on pre-defined guidelines. Out of the 364 respondents, only 10 defined zoonoses accurately (2.8%). Only 33.7% of the respondents in the public college (62 out of 184) and 3.3% in the private college (6 out of 180) could correctly name three common parasitic zoonoses in India. Only 5.5% of respondents (20 out of 361) were able to identify rabies as a disease transmitted by animals other than dogs. Knowledge on all emerging and new infectious diseases was poor. The average knowledge score was 64% in the public medical college and 41.4% in the private medical college. These poor scores imply that, on average, a student knows only 40-60% of what is needed to diagnose, treat and report zoonotic diseases effectively. Considering the changing landscape of infectious diseases, the current medical curriculum needs to be revised to improve understanding of existing zoonoses and also include emerging diseases. © 2011 Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.

AB  - The recent explosion in world population growth and the mass movement of people into developed forest in tropical and subtropical areas has dramatically increased the potential for humans to come into contact with new species and strains of pathogens. For example, many investigators believe that the Ebola, HIV, and SARS viruses are all zoonotic pathogens, transmitted from animal hosts to man. New pathogens, such as the Ebola virus, the AIDS virus (HIV), hemorrhagic colon bacillus O-157, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), avian influenza virus A (H5N1) are all emerging diseases. It is not possible to predict whether avian influenza virus A (H5N1) will become next human influenza pandemic virus. Malaria control cannot eliminate the mosquito vector, the parasite, and the favorable environmental conditions for transmission of the parasite, thus, the creation of new anti-malaria interventions including therapeutic drugs, vector control tools, diagnostic methods, and vaccines are urgently needed for control and prevention. International travel to developing countries may introduce new health risks, with poor quality of accommodation, inadequate hygiene and sanitation, underdeveloped medical services, and unavailability of clean water. Travelers must take measures to avoid illness, thus, vaccinations and anti-malarial medication are required. Such travel has promoted the spread of infections such as dengue, hepatitis A, West Nile, hemorrhagic fevers, and malaria that are prevalent in Africa and Asia. It is thought that global infectious disease surveillance and response networks are required for control and prevention of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) with international cooperation partners. This short review focuses on avian influenza A (H5N1), swine influenza A (H1N1) virus (S-OIV) as an emerging disease, malaria as a re-emerging disease, and the importance of infectious diseases acquired via overseas travel to tropical areas. © 2010 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - Filarial nematodes are arthropod-borne parasites, which sometimes cause serious disease in man and animals. The most important filarial worms of man are Onchocerca volvulus, the cause of river-blindness and severe skin disease, and Wuchereria bancrofti, the cause of tropical elephantiasis and hydrocoel. Another serious pathogen of man is Brugia malayi (B. malayi), and its distribution is limited to Asia. There are two well-defined strains of B. malayi, which differ in their microfilarial periodicity patterns. The nocturnally subperiodic strain is found in the dense swamp forest where its mosquito vectors prefer to feed at night but also bite during the day. The nocturnally periodic strain of B. malayi is found in the open plains where the vectors feed only at night. The correlation between peak peripheral microfilaraemia and peak biting time suggests that filarial nematodes have adapted their periodicity patterns to vector periodicity patterns for facilitating their transmission by mosquitoes. Nocturnally subperiodic B. malayi is common in wild monkeys, and this led to the assumption that it is zoonotic. Mansonia mosquitoes, the vectors of subperiodic B. malayi, feed on a variety of animal hosts, including man. The chapter presents the vector-parasite and definitive host–parasite relationships. © 1977 Academic Press Inc. (London) Ltd.

AB  - Reported are the results of studies over the period 1989-94 on host-flea complexes in small mammals and their flea ectoparasites in and around a number of human settlements in Viet Nam in which human cases of plague had been found. Collections were also made in savanna and tropical forest areas within a 10-km radius of the settlements. The greatest numbers of small mammals, for the most part Rattus spp., and of the flea ectoparasite Xenopsylla cheopis were found in inhabited areas. X. cheopis was not found on any feral or sylvan mammal further than 0.6 km from settlements. A possible link between wild and commensal mammals may be provided by the flea Lentistivalius klossi, a specific parasite of squirrels and tree-shrews but also found in very small numbers on commensal rats. No zoonotic foci of plague were found in the immediate vicinity of the villages studied and it is most likely that plague persists in a commensal rat X. cheopis cycle in and around human settlements in Viet Nam.

AB  - Aim: The vulnerability of tropical developing countries to the emerging disease constitutes a critical phenomenon in which the invasion of wild niches by human hosts, contributes to expansion of zoonotic diseases, such as the Brazilian spotted fever (BSF). This study performed a diagnosis of species occurrence of their hosts (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) and vectors (Amblyomma sculptum and Amblyomma dubitatum) on the warning area for this reemerging disease in Brazil. Materials and Methods: The study was conducted in a warning area for BSF in the city of Americana, São Paulo state. The occurrence of capybaras was registered by use of binoculars and GPS equipment and 24 acarological researches were performed through 180 CO2 traps. Samples of adult ticks were dissected for salivary glands removal, DNA extraction, and evaluation by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) being tested by initial gltA-PCR, ompA-PCR, and Rickettsia bellii-specific PCR, with the positive samples subjected to sequencing. Results: Eleven clusters of capybaras (total of 71 individuals), were observed along the riparian of Ribeirão Quilombo and 7,114 specimens of A. sculptum and 7,198 specimens of A. dubitatum were collected in this same area. About 568 samples of adult ticks were dissected for salivary glands removal, DNA extraction and evaluation by gltA-PCR, with results of 1.94% (11/568) of positive samples. Results for the initial gltA-PCR indicated none positive sample to Rickettsia species into A. sculptum and 11 positive samples to A. dubitatum. These samples were negative to the ompA-PCR and positive to the Rickettsia bellii-specific PCR protocol and subjected to DNA sequencing, whose result indicated 100% similarity to Rickettsia bellii. The distribution of tick species A. sculptum and A. dubitatum was configured regarding to the biotic potential of the riparian areas, measuring the risks for BSF in peri-urban areas of Americana. Conclusion: These results confirmed a status of epidemiological warning with a strong association of the amplifiers hosts of Rickettsia and tick vectors for the transmission of BSF to humans in this region. © The authors.
