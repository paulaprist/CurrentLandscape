TI  - Flea Communities on Small Rodents in Eastern Poland
T2  - INSECTS
AB  - Simple Summary
   Fleas are obligatory, secondarily wingless, hematophagous insects living all over the world. They colonize a variety of habitats from wet tropical forests to semi-arid and desert areas. Adult individuals feed mainly on small mammals, and less often on birds. The aim of the present study was to explore the fauna of fleas and their broad-sense behavior in eastern Poland. Rodents, which are widely recognized as one of the preferred hosts of these insects, were caught to carry out the study. The results show that, regardless of the ecological habitat type, the striped field mouse Apodemus agrarius was the most frequently captured rodent species, and the Ctenophthalmus agyrtes flea species was collected most frequently. Moreover, rhythms in the seasonal activity of fleas, with a peak in summer months, were noted.
   Fleas are hematophagous insects infesting mainly small mammals and, less frequently, birds. With their wide range of potential hosts, fleas play a significant role in the circulation of pathogens in nature. Depending on the species, they can be vectors for viruses, bacteria, rickettsiae, and protozoa and a host for some larval forms of tapeworm species. The aim of this study was to determine the species composition of fleas and their small rodent host preferences in eastern Poland. Animals were captured in traps in various types of ecological habitats (a site covered by grassland vegetation within city limits, an unused agricultural meadow, and a fallow land near a mixed forest). The following rodent species were caught: Apodemus agrarius, Apodemus flavicollis, Microtus arvalis, and Myodes glareolus. Additionally, Ctenophthalmus agyrtes, Ctenophthalmus assimilis, Hystrichopsylla talpae, and Nosopsyllus fasciatus flea species were identified. The peak of the flea activity was noted in summer months. C. agyrtes was found to be the most abundant flea species in eastern Poland, while the greatest numbers of fleas were collected from the rodent species A. agrarius.

TI  - A comparison of Kato-Katz technique to three other methods for diagnosis of <i>Amphimerus</i> spp. liver fluke infection and the prevalence of infection in Chachi Amerindians of Ecuador
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Background
   Recently, a high prevalence of infection by the liver fluke Amphimerus spp. has been documented in the Chachi Amerindians of Ecuador. For diagnosis, no studies exist that compare the sensitivity of different coproparasitological detection techniques. The present study compares the Kato-Katz technique with three other coproparasitological methods for detecting eggs of Amphimerus in stools, as well as determines the prevalence of infection in Chachi residents in a Tropical rain forest area in the northwest coast of Ecuador.
   Methodology/Results
   total of 105 samples, utilizing the Kato-Katz technique (KK), the spontaneous sedimentation technique in tube (SSTT), the formalin-ether concentration technique (FEC), and direct smear microscopy (DM), were examined. Combining the four methods (fixed "gold" standard), 38 samples were positive with a prevalence of infection of 36.2%. The sensitivities of individual methods were 71%, 58%, 50% and 3% for KK, SSTT, FEC, and DM respectively. Our results indicated that KK alone had the best performance, detecting 27 (71%) of the 38 positive samples. The combination of KK and SSTT detected amphimeriasis in 36 (95%) samples, and KK and FEC in 31 (82%) samples.
   Conclusions
   DM showed the lowest sensitivity, which raises concern for its value, because it is the standard technique for stool examination for detection of parasites in both public and private laboratories in Ecuador. SSTT alone detected eggs in 22 samples (58%) and would be recommended for field studies because of its simplicity. Performing two techniques on a single sample enhances the detection of Amphimerus infection. Its sensitivity is relative to a fixed gold" standard, determined as the combined results of the four techniques performed. This study confirms the high prevalence of human infection by Amphimerus in the indigenous Chachi group where the first human cases were described.

TI  - Prevalence of antibodies to mosquito-borne encephalitis viruses in residents of the Coachella Valley, California
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Sera from 19 (2.6%) and 118 (16.4%) of 719 outpatients attending clinics in the southeastern Coachella Valley, California during 1993 and 1994 exhibited IgG antibodies to western equine encephalomyelitis and St. Louis encephalitis (SLE) viruses, respectively, using enzyme immunoassays. However, only seven (1.0%) and 36 (5.0%) outpatients were positive by plaque-reduction neutralization tests (PRNTs), and seven (1.0%) and 84 (11.7%) outpatients were positive by sera hemagglutination inhibition assays, respectively. None were positive for IgM antibodies indicative of recent infection or were diagnosed clinically with central nervous system disease. Prevalence of PRNT antibody to SLE increased as a function of patient age, but did not vary significantly in relation to years of residence, sex, race, postal zip code, occupation, or month of collection.

TI  - Evaluation of resistance to pyrethroid and organophosphate adulticides and <i>kdr</i> genotyping in <i>Aedes aegypti</i> populations from Roraima, the northernmost Brazilian State
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
AB  - BackgroundRoraima, the northernmost State in Brazil, borders Venezuela and Guyana. Although mostly covered by the tropical forests, the urban centers of this state are highly infested with Ae. aegypti and are endemic for dengue, Zika and chikungunya. We accessed the insecticide resistance status of Ae. aegypti populations from the capital Boa Vista, two cities on international borders (Pacaraima and Bonfim) and Rorainopolis bordering Amazonas State, in order to evaluate the chemical control efficacy in these localities.MethodsTests with World Health Organization (WHO)-like tubes impregnated with the pyrethroid deltamethrin (0.05% and 0.12%) and the organophosphate malathion (0.7%) were conducted with Ae. aegypti from Boa Vista, Pacaraima, Bonfim and Rorainopolis, collected in 2016 and 2018. Genotyping of kdr mutations, related to resistance to pyrethroids, was performed for the SNP variations at sites 1016 and 1534 of the voltage gated sodium channel gene (Na-V) with a TaqMan qPCR approach.ResultsAedes albopictus was absent in our collections, and therefore only Ae. aegypti was tested. All Ae. aegypti populations were susceptible to 0.7% malathion in 2016; however, mortality dropped to under 90% in Bonfim and Pacaraima populations in 2018. All populations were resistant to 0.05% deltamethrin in both years. The time that 50% of females suffered knockdown (KdT(50)) under exposure to 0.05% deltamethrin was 3.3-5.9-fold longer in mosquitoes from the natural populations compared to the susceptible Rockefeller strain. Only the Pacaraima population (2018) remained resistant to 0.12% deltamethrin. Kdr genotyping revealed the absence of the wild-type NaVS haplotype (1016Val+1534Phe) in the populations from Roraima, indicating that all tested insects had a genetic background for pyrethroid resistance. The double kdr Na(V)R2 haplotype (1016Ile+15434Cys) was present in higher frequencies in all populations except for Rorainopolis, where this haplotype seems to have arrived recently.ConclusionsThese results are important for the knowledge about insecticide resistance status of Ae. aegypti populations from Roraima and will help improve vector control strategies that may be applied to diverse localities under similar geographical and urban conditions.

TI  - Pharmacological actions of <i>Thespesia populnea</i> relevant to Alzheimer's disease
T2  - PHYTOMEDICINE
AB  - Thespesia populnea (Malvaceae) is a large tree found in the tropical regions and coastal forests of India. Various parts of T populnea are found to possess useful medicinal properties, such as antifertility, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, purgative and hepatoprotective activity. The present study was undertaken to investigate the effects of T populnea bark on cognitive functions, total cholesterol levels and cholinesterase activity in mice. A total of 312 mice divided into 52 different groups were employed in the present investigation. The ethanolic extract of T. populnea (TPE) was administered orally in three doses (100, 200 and 400 mg/kg) for 7 successive days to different groups of young and aged mice. The learning and memory parameters were assessed using elevated plus maze and passive avoidance apparatus. TPE (200 and 400 mg/kg, p.o.) showed significant improvement in memory of young and aged mice. TPE also reversed the amnesia induced by scopolamine (0.4 mg/kg, i.p.) and diazepam (I mg/kg, i.p.). Furthermore, TPE reduced significantly the central (brain) cholinesterase activity in mice. TPE exhibited a remarkable cholesterol lowering property comparable to simvastatin (a standard drug) in the present study. Furthermore, we observed that, T populnea bark possessed a powerful memory enhancing activity in mice. Since diminished cholinergic transmission and increased cholesterol levels appear to be responsible for development of amyloid plaques and dementia in Alzheimer patients, TPE may prove to be a useful medicine on account of its multifarious beneficial effects, such as memory improving property, cholesterol lowering, anticholinesterase and anti-inflammatory activity. Therefore, T populnea bark appears to be a promising candidate for improving memory and it would be worthwhile to explore the potential of this plant in the management of Alzheimer patients.

TI  - Spatial expansion and population structure of the neotropical malaria vector, <i>Anopheles darlingi</i> (Diptera: Culicidae)
T2  - BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY
AB  - Extensive population structuring is known to occur in Anopheles darlingi, the primary malaria vector of the Neotropics. We analysed the phylogeographic structure of the species using the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I marker. Diversity is divided into six main population groups in South America: Colombia, central Amazonia, southern Brazil, south-eastern Brazil, and two groups in north-east Brazil. The ancestral distribution of the taxon is hypothesized to be central Amazonia, and there is evidence of expansion from this region during the late Pleistocene. The expansion was not a homogeneous front, however, with at least four subgroups being formed due to geographic barriers. As the species spread, populations became isolated from each other by the Amazon River and the coastal mountain ranges of south-eastern Brazil and the Andes. Analyses incorporating distances around these barriers suggest that the entire South American range of An. darlingi is at mutation-dispersal-drift equilibrium. Because the species is distributed throughout such a broad area, the limited dispersal across some landscape types promotes differentiation between otherwise proximate populations. Moreover, samples from the An. darlingi holotype location in Rio de Janeiro State are substantially derived from all other populations, implying that there may be additional genetic differences of epidemiological relevance. The results obtained contribute to our understanding of gene flow in this species and allow the formulation of human mosquito health protocols in light of the potential population differences in vector capacity or tolerance to control strategies.

TI  - <i>Teratosphaeria pseudoeucalypti</i> on eucalyptus in Brazil
T2  - TROPICAL PLANT PATHOLOGY
AB  - A new foliar disease caused by Teratosphaeria pseudoeucalypti on eucalyptus (E. globulus, E. urophylla x E. globulus and E. nitens x E. globulus) in Brazil is described. The disease is characterized by leaf spots of variable sizes and shapes, resulting in leaf blight and premature defoliation. Based on the morphological characteristics and multilocus phylogenetic analysis of the EF-1 alpha, beta-T and ITS-2 gene regions of five isolates, the fungus was identified as T. pseudoeucalypti. This is the first report of this pathogen outside Australia and a method for sporulation in culture is described.

TI  - Farm land size and onchocerciasis status of peasant farmers in south-western Nigeria
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE & INTERNATIONAL HEALTH
AB  - Concern is being raised about the economic impact of the non-blinding strain of onchocerciasis, since half of those affected with onchocerciasis in Africa live in the forest zones where the non-blinding form is prevalent. WHO's TDR programme has embarked on multi-country studies on the social and economic effects of onchocercal skin disease (OSD). Baseline data from one site, the Ibarapa Local Government Area of Oyo State, Nigeria, is presented here. Farmers were screened for signs and symptoms of onchocerciasis including palpable nodules, reactive skin lesions and self-reported severe itching. Those having two or more of these conditions were classified as having severe OSD. A matching group of farmers without any of the signs or symptoms formed a control group. Women in the area either did not farm or held only one small plot. Land size comparisons were undertaken with 51 pairs of male farmers matched for age and location within 23 small hamlets bordering the Ogun River. Farmers with OSD had significantly less farmland under cultivation (9117 m(2)) than those with no OSD (13850 m(2)). The farmers with OSD did not appear to have alternative income strategies to compensate and, consequently, they had a lower value of personal wealth indicators (e.g. iron sheet roofing, motorcycle) than these without OSD. One can conclude that although the effect of forest strain onchocerciasis is less dramatic than of the blinding from, the disease poses an important economic threat in the region.

TI  - Genetic diversity and parentage in farmer selections of cacao from Southern Sulawesi, Indonesia revealed by microsatellite markers
T2  - BREEDING SCIENCE
AB  - Indonesia is the third largest cocoa-producing country in the world. Knowledge of genetic diversity and parentage of farmer selections is important for effective selection and rational deployment of superior cacao clones in farmers' fields. We assessed genetic diversity and parentage of 53 farmer selections of cacao in Sulawesi, Indonesia, using 152 international clones as references. Cluster analysis, based on 15 microsatellite markers, showed that these Sulawesi farmer selections are mainly comprised of hybrids derived from Trinitario and two Upper Amazon Forastero groups. Bayesian assignment and likelihood-based parentage analysis further demonstrated that only a small number of germplasm groups, dominantly Trinitario and Parinari, contributed to these fanner selections, in spite of diverse parental clones having been used in the breeding program and seed gardens in Indonesia since the 1950s. The narrow parentage predicts a less durable host resistance to cacao diseases. Limited access of the farmers to diverse planting materials or the strong preference for large pods and large bean size by local farmers, may have affected the selection outcome. Diverse sources of resistance, harbored in different cacao germplasm groups, need to be effectively incorporated to broaden the on-farm diversity and ensure sustainable cacao production in Sulawesi.

In the present work, the action of the South American rattlesnake Crotalus durissus terrificus venom on CHO-K1 cell line was analyzed. The cells CHO-K1 were incubated with C. d. terrificus venom ( 10, 50 and 100g/ml) for 1 and 24 hours, and structural alterations of actin filaments, endoplasmic reticulum and nucleus were assessed using specific fluorescent probes and agarose gel electrophoresis for DNA fragmentation. Significant structural changes were observed in all analyzed structures. DNA fragmentation was detected suggesting that, at the concentrations used, the venom induced apoptosis.

TI  - ALIEN PHYTOPHAGOUS INSECT AND MITE SPECIES ON WOODY PLANTS IN CROATIA
T2  - SUMARSKI LIST
AB  - Alien species are defined as species living outside of their natural range and outside of their natural dispersal potential. When an alien species enters a novel environment and has negative ecological and economical impact it becomes invasive species. Alien species are considered as one of the major threats to biodiversity after habitat destruction and enormous damage is done by them to ecosystems and economies. They have been described as an outstanding global problem. Economic damages associated with alien species in several countries in the world amount to about 5 % of the world GNP. Numerous alien insect species, many introduced only in the last 200 years, have become successfully established in various ecosystems in Europe, 1541 species of alien invertebrates are already present, 94 % of them are arthropods and 90 % of them are insects. More than half of the alien invertebrates are phytophagous (52 %) and 30 % of them infest trees and shrubs. Basic knowledge of the identity, origin, pathway, time of introduction of alien species is essential for assessing the threats from alien species and the first requirement when assessing the impact of alien species on ecosystems is to make an alien species inventory of a certain territory or country. Such studies are needed to assess which taxonomic or bio-ecological groups of alien insects are more successful invaders or more harmful to environment and economy. Croatia lacks such an inventory. Even though Croatia was included in most recent and comprehensive study of alien terrestrial arthropodes in Europe, Croatian references with first records were totally missing. There is no up-to-date list of phytophagous alien insect species on woody plants in Croatia. The aim of this paper is to provide up-to-date comprehensive list of known phytophagous alien insect and mite species on woody plants in Croatia with all relevant Croatian references.
   The starting point for compiling the list of alien species of phytophagous insects on woody plants in Croatia was a book "Alien Terrestrial Arthropodes of Europe" and database DAISIE. These are primary online resources on alien insect species available to the public and first qualified reference system on invasive alien species for the European region. We compiled the list by searching many sources of forestry, agricultural and taxonomic entomological peer-reviewed literature in Croatia, checklists and primary research publications on alien insect species. The references in these sources were examined for additional relevant publications.
   A total of 101 phytophagous alien species (98 insect species from 6 orders and 3 mite species form subclass Acarina) on woody plants were recorded (Table 1) and they are already present in Croatian entomofauna. They were dominated by Hemiptera (56.4 %), Lepidoptera (14.9 %), Hymenoptera (12.9 %), followed by Diptera (5.9 %) and Coleoptera (5.9 %), Acarina (3 %) and Thysanoptera (1 %)(Figure 1). One third (33.7 %) of the alien species in Croatia originate from Asia, 26.7 % from North America while 12.9 % are of tropical origin (Figure 2). From the 101 established alien insect species in Croatia, an increase in the number of introductions can be noted in the first decade of 21st century (Figure 3). Agricultural lands are the most frequently invaded habitats by alien phytophagous insects in Croatia (56.4 %), followed by parks and gardens (28.7 %) and woodlands and forests (14.9 %)(Figure 4).
   Order Hemiptera clearly dominates as it includes some of the most successful invaders (57 %) on woody plants in Croatia. Similar results were obtained at a country level for Hungary, Great Britain, Italy, Slovenia and Europe in general. This outcome can be attributed to the fact that species of this order remain undetected and are easily transported due to their tiny size in concert with the intensive trade in agricultural commodities. The occurrence of other orders (Lepidoptera 14 %, Hymenoptera 13 %, Diptera 6 %, Coleoptera 6 %, and Thysanoptera 1 %) is slightly different from other European countries. Results from several investigations have shown strong positive correlations between the number of alien insects per European country and the volume of manufactured and agricultural imports, road network size, the GDP and the geographic size. In contrast, alien species richness was not correlated with the total or percentage of forest cover. The number of alien insects is positively correlated with country surface area, and bordering the sea does not influence the number of alien insect species which is quite important for Croatia. There is a strong correlation between the number of alien insect species and the total amount of imports and level of international trade of the country. It can be predicted that the number of established alien insect species will grow as Croatia shows constant increase of traded commodities with other European and non-European countries. In this review we have listed alien insect species that have not yet been recorded for Croatia on European level. These are Oxycarenus lavaterae; Massilieurodes chitendeni; Adelges (Dreyfusia) nordmannianae; Pineus (Eopineus) strobi; Protopulvinaria pyriformis; Dryocosmus kuriphilus; Platygaster robinae; Aproceros leucopoda; Rhyzobius lophanthae; Rodolia cardinalis; Harmonia axyridis; Xylosandrus germanus; Caloptilia roscipennella; Caloptilia azaleella; Phyllocnistis citrella; Argyresthia thuiella; Cydalima perspectalis; Dasineura gleditchiae; Ceratitis capitata; Rhagoletis cingulata and Drosophila suzukii. Some of them are novel and only recently introduced alien species whereas some of them are present for decades in Croatia but due to the lack of a comprehensive and regularly updated inventory of alien species they have not been listed before. This also makes this up-to-date list of alien phytophagous insects in Croatia valuable. Our results have shown that Asia is the main region of origin of alien insects established in Croatia (33 %), followed by North America (27 %). The trends are similar in other European countries and Europe in general. A rapid increase in the number of new alien species introduction per year in Croatia is noticeable from the years 2007-2012 (6.4 species/year) compared to 2002-2007 (1.8 species/year) (Figure 3). In Europe, an average of 17.5 new species of insects per year was recorded between 2000 and 2007, while this value was only 8.1 from 1950 to 1974. In Europe twice as many new insect species were observed per year on trees and shrubs during the period 2000-2007 (6.3 species) compared to 1960-1979 (3.4 species). The differences between the number of new alien species/year in Europe and Croatia are probably due to differences in sampling efforts, country surface, volume of traded goods etc but the rapidly increasing trend is obvious. More than 80 % of alien insect species in Croatia (57 % on agricultural lands and 28 % in parks and gardens) have been established in man-made habitats (Figure 4).
   Only 15 % of alien insect species in Croatia have established themselves in natural environments (forests and woodlands) which is almost the same percentage as on European level. It is a common observation that simple, disturbed, man-made habitats are more easily invaded by insects and other invaders than complex, undisturbed, natural habitats. Alien insects linked to human environments and activities (e.g. ornamental plants, bonsais, seeds, large potted trees, cut flowers, vegetables, fruits) are more likely to be carried by human transports into a new region than insects living in natural areas. A study has shown that bonsais carry a more diverse alien insect fauna then timber and that ornamental plants constitute "miniature" ecosystems which may host a large variety of insects that have the potential to damage other woody plants as well. Almost 90 % of alien invertebrates in Europe were introduced unintentionally through human activities, mostly as contaminants of a commodity. In Europe, ornamental plant trade contributes significantly more than forestry products to the invasion of alien forest insects. As interception data have not been analysed in this paper, a research of such data for alien insect species and trade volumes in horticultural plants in Croatia is strongly needed. There is a strong suspicion that ornamental plants are one of main pathways of introduction of alien insects to Croatia due to the increase of the imported volumes from year to year. Alien insect species are known for being serious pests worldwide and they can impact habitats which they invade in several ways. Alien insects can affect native biodiversity through direct actions: phytophagous insects feeding on plants, a predator or a parasitoid attacking host, an alien species hybridizing with a native species or indirect actions: vectoring diseases, competing for food, or sharing natural enemies with native species. This research has shown that dangerous pests that can cause direct economic costs have invaded and are spreading in Croatia (Table 1). Due to high percentage of alien insect on agricultural lands (outdoor and in glasshouses) in Croatia (Figure 4) the yield losses of alien insect species on agricultural crops in Croatia must be considerable. Alien insects can have serious negative impact on forests, woodlands and urban parks. Some potentially damaging forest and urban pests have already established themselves in Croatia. In countries where the percentage of forest cover is high (Croatia around 44 %) the damage from alien insects is expected to be considerable. Most introductions of alien insects are unintentional and unpredictable. Less than 20 % of the alien invertebrates in Europe have been intercepted before their arrival. There are several harmful phytophagous alien species approaching the borders of Croatia: Agrilus planipennis which could pose serious threat to Croatian lowland oak ecosystems, Anoplophora sp. which is spreading rapidly in Northern Italy. Some of the most polyphagous alien insect species, such as Drosophila suzukii, have only recently been discovered in Croatia. This study has also shown a time lag between arrival and first record of an alien species which has direct implications on successful eradication measures. Climate change may directly influence establishment and colonisation of alien insect species in new territories-from other continents to Europe and from warmer European regions of Europe further north.
   Global warming is likely to influence establishment and spread of alien insect species from subtropical and tropical areas (24 % found in Croatia) especially on the Mediterranean coast. One of the main factors, globalisation, will definitely influence the upward trend of introduction and spread of new alien species in Croatia which will negatively influence economy and ecosystems.

The increased acquired resistence to anthelmintics by gastrointestinal nematodes, requires biological control be considered as a potential feasible and effective alternative. The most effective: natural soil enemies of nematodes are nematophagous fungi. In order to collect and identify predator nematophagous fungi (PNF), samples were obtained from 51 farms distributed throughout the seven provinces of Costa Rica. The origin samples included: soil from different crops (potatoes. tomatoes, bananas, ornamental plants, squash and coffee); animal feces (cattle, sheep, goat and horse); soil and fallen leaves from forest; and plans with signs of nematode infection. Each sample was processed using three techniques for the extraction of fungi from soil: sprinkling technique, soil dilution and humidity chamber. Twenty four strains of nematophagous fungi were found in 19 farms; 83.3% of the fungi were isolated by sprinkling technique. The following fung were idenified: Arthrobotrys oligospora (n=13); Candelabrella musiformis (n=9); and for the first time there was isolation of A. conoides (n=1) and A. dactyloides (n=1) in the country. Moreover, 16 strains from Trichodorma (n=13), Beauveria (n=1), Clonostachys (n=1) and Lecanicillium (n=1) were obtained. In addition, pH of each possible fungal isolation source was measured, and it varied from 5.2 to 9.9, however PNF isolates fell within the range of 5.6 to 7.5. The PNF strains were cultivated in four different media for the production of chhlamydospores: potato dextrose agar (PDA); corn meal agar (CMA); malt extract agar (MEA) and potato carrot agar (PCA). Out: of these cultures, 95.8% of the strains formed chlamydospores primarily in the PCA. Of these strains, the profilic spore producers were subjected to ruminant artificial gastrointestinal conditions. A total of 14 fungi were tested, out of which 42.9% survived the digestive analysis. Neither A. conoides nor A. dactyloides were viable following the in vitro gastrointestinal test. The PNF isolated in this study demostrated an action against ovine and caprine gastrointestinal nematodes and are candidates for use in biological control of these organisms. Among these microorganisms, Candelabrella musiformis appears to be the most promising fungi for use at a biological control agent in Costa Rica. Rev. Biol. Trop. 59(1): 37-52. Epub 2011 March 01.

TI  - Morbidity and mortality of wild animals in relation to outbreaks of Ebola haemorrhagic fever in Gabon, 1994-2003
T2  - TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Antibody to Ebola virus was found in 14 (1.2%) of 1147 human sera collected in Gabon in 1981-1997. Six seropositive subjects were bled in the northeast in 1991, more than 3 years prior to recognition of the first known outbreak of Ebola haemorrhagic fever (EHF), whilst eight came from the southwest where the disease has not been recognised. It has been reported elsewhere that 98 carcasses of wild animals were found in systematic studies in northeastern Gabon and adjoining northwestern Republic of the Congo (RoC) during five EHF epidemics in August 2001 to June 2003, with Ebola virus infection being confirmed in 14 carcasses. During the present opportunistic observations, reports were investigated of a further 397 carcasses, mainly gorillas, chimpanzees, mandrills and bush pigs, found by rural residents in 35 incidents in Gabon and RoC during 1994-2003. Sixteen incidents had temporal and/or spatial coincidence with confirmed EHF outbreaks, and the remaining 19 appeared to represent extension of disease from such sites. There appeared to be sustained Ebola virus activity in the northeast in 1994-1999, with sequential spread from 1996 onwards, first westwards, then southerly, and then north-eastwards, reaching the Gabon-RoC border in 2001. This implies that there was transmission of infection between wild mammals, but the species involved are highly susceptible and unlikely to be natural hosts of the virus.

TI  - Machine learning techniques for regional scale estimation of high-resolution cloud-free daily sea surface temperatures from MODIS data
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
AB  - High-resolution sea surface temperature (SST) estimates are dependent on satellite-based infrared radiometers, which are proven to be highly accurate in the past decades. However, the presence of clouds is a big stumbling block when physical approaches are used to derive SST. This problem is more prominent across tropical regions such as Arabian Sea(AS) and Bay of Bengal(BoB), restricting the availability of high-resolution SST data for ocean applications. The previous studies for developing daily high-resolution cloud-free SST products mainly focus on fusion of multiple satellites and in-situ data products that are computationally expensive and often time consuming. At the same time, it was observed that the capabilities of data-driven approaches are not yet fully explored in the estimation of cloud-free high-resolution SST data. Hence, in this study an attempt has been made for the first time to estimate daily cloud free SST from a single sensor (MODIS Aqua) dataset using advanced machine learning techniques. Here, three distinct machine learning techniques such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Random Forest (RF)-based algorithms were developed and evaluated over two different study areas within the AS and BoB using 10 years of MODIS data and in-situ reference data. Among the developed algorithms, the SVR-based algorithm performs consistently better. In AS region, while testing, the SVR-based SST estimates was able to achieve an adjusted coefficient of determination (R-adj(2)) of 0.82 and root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.71 degrees C with respect to the in situ data. Similarly, in BoB too, the SVR algorithm outperforms the other algorithms with R-adj(2) of 0.78 with RMSE of 0.88 degrees C. Further, a spatio-temporal and visual analysis of the results as well as an inter-comparision with NOAA AVHRR daily optimally interpolated global SST (a standard SST product available in practice) the suggest that the proposed SVR-based algorithm has huge potential to produce operational high-resolution cloud-free SST estimates, even if there is cloud cover in the image.

TI  - Cacao cultivation and the conservation of biological diversity
T2  - AMBIO
AB  - Cacao (Theobroma cacao) is a crop of the humid lowland tropics produced largely by small-scale producers and often on farms with a canopy of shade trees. Where a diverse shaded canopy is used, cacao farms support higher levels of biological diversity than most other tropical crops. A host of viral and fungal diseases, loss of soil fertility, and numerous socioeconomic problems facing producers, often makes cacao production locally unsustainable. Continued clearing of new lands threatens biodiversity. Moreover, new frontiers for cacao expansion are rapidly disappearing. Such problems can be addressed by increasing the long-term productivity of existing cacao farms and restoring abandoned lands. Improved shade management offers guidance along this path. Institutions involved with cocoa should establish collaborations with groups concerned with development, environmental protection, and most importantly producers themselves to pursue a program of research, extension and policy initiatives focused on the ecologically and economically sustainable cacao production on farms with a diverse shade canopy.

TI  - Computer-Assisted Discovery of Alkaloids with Schistosomicidal Activity
T2  - CURRENT ISSUES IN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
AB  - Schistosomiasis is a chronic parasitic disease caused by trematodes of the genus Schistosoma; it is commonly caused by Schistosoma mansoni, which is transmitted by Bioamphalaria snails. Studies show that more than 200 million people are infected and that more than 90% of them live in Africa. Treatment with praziquantel has the best cost-benefit result on the market. However, hypersensitivity, allergy, and drug resistance are frequently presented after administration. From this perspective, ligand-based and structure-based virtual screening (VS) techniques were combined to select potentially active alkaloids against S. mansoni from an internal dataset (SistematX). A set of molecules with known activity against S. mansoni was selected from the ChEMBL database to create two different models with accuracy greater than 84%, enabling ligand-based VS of the alkaloid bank. Subsequently, structure-based VS was performed through molecular docking using four targets of the parasite. Finally, five consensus hits (i.e., five alkaloids with schistosomicidal potential), were selected. In addition, in silico evaluations of the metabolism, toxicity, and drug-like profile of these five selected alkaloids were carried out. Two of them, namely, 11,12-methylethylenedioxypropoxy and methyl-3-oxo-12-methoxy-n(1)-decarbomethoxy-14,15-didehydrochanofruticosinate, had plausible toxicity, metabolomics, and toxicity profiles. These two alkaloids could serve as starting points for the development of new schistosomicidal compounds based on natural products.

TI  - Yellow fever: study of an outbreak
T2  - REVISTA DA SOCIEDADE BRASILEIRA DE MEDICINA TROPICAL
AB  - This study had the aim of describing an outbreak of yellow fever that occurred in the municipalities under the jurisdiction of the Regional Healthcare Administration of Diamantina, Minas Gerais, between 2002 and 2003, in which 36 cases were notified. This was an autochthonous outbreak of wildtype yellow fever. Failure of vaccinal coverage and low levels of detection of mild cases were found. Among the cases, 33 (91.7%) were male and the age range was from 16 to 67 years. Nineteen (52.8%) of the cases were classified as severe and 12 men (33.3%) died of the disease. All of the cases came from rural areas and presented fever, headache, vomiting, jaundice, myalgia, oliguria and signs of hemorrhage. Surveillance through laboratory tests was the determining factor in diagnosing the outbreak. By describing the epidemiological and clinic findings, this study contributes towards diagnosing and classifying this disease. It was deduced that there is a relationship between deforestation, and outbreaks, and that there is a potential regional risk of yellow fever because of the local development of tourism.

Methods: We investigated arboviruses in 164 serum samples collected from patients presenting with clinical symptoms of dengue fever and 152 mosquito pools. Results: We detected the Asian II genotype of DENV-2 in humans and mosquitoes. Our results confirmed the circulation of the Asian II genotype in Brazil, in addition to the prevalent Asian/American genotype. Conclusions: The detection of Asian II genotype of DENV-2 in mosquito pools collected in a forest park may be related to a spillback event of human dengue virus.

TI  - Causes and effects of weak enforcement of environmental sanitation laws in Ghana
T2  - JOURNAL OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR IN THE SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Indiscriminate waste disposal practices and open defecation put pressure on environmental and human health in developing countries. Environmental sanitation laws have been enacted in those countries in an attempt to change sanitation behavior, but enforcement has been weak. This study examined the causes of poor enforcement of environmental sanitation laws in Ghana and the effects of the phenomenon on environmental and public health. Qualitative data were collected from 83 sanitation-related experts, informants, and workers, and analyzed using the thematic approach. It became evident that the main causes were the weak political will of the government, low commitment of enforcement institutions, mild sanctions regime, inadequate funding for enforcement, pervasive corruption, poor sanitation culture, and low capacity of the enforcement institutions. The environmental health effects were polluted air and water bodies, choked drainage systems, seasonal flooding, and dirty community landscapes. The public health effects were the incidence of diseases including, diarrhea, malaria, typhoid, and neglected tropical diseases. The government should build a mix of committed political, cultural, religious, legal, and social institutions, comprising relevant sector ministries and local governments, traditional authorities, churches and mosques, sanitation tribunals, vibrant civil society organizations, and mass media for enforcement management through advocacy and public education on sanitation and the laws. The government should provide funding, fight corruption, equip the relevant institutions, and hold the frontline enforcement institutions-sector ministries and local governments-accountable for the lapses in enforcement. The socio-cultural behavior change approach to enforcement should be strengthened in support of the traditional prosecutorial and sanctions regime.

TI  - Tsetse Flies Infected with Trypanosomes in Three Active Human African Trypanosomiasis Foci of the Republic of Congo
T2  - PATHOGENS
AB  - Introduction: Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) is a neglected tropical disease still endemic in the Republic of Congo. Despite the continuous detection of HAT cases in the country, there is still not enough data on trypanosome infections in tsetse flies, trypanosome species and tsetse flies' species distribution in endemic foci. The present study was intended to fill this gap and improve understanding of trypanosome circulation in three active foci in the centre and south of Congo. Methods: Pyramid traps were set in various places in villages to collect tsetse flies both during the rainy and dry seasons. Once collected, tsetse flies were identified using morphological keys. DNA extracted from flies was processed by PCR for species identification and for detection of trypanosome presence. A second PCR was run for different trypanosome species identification. Results: A total of 1291 tsetse flies were collected. The average apparent density of flies per day was 0.043 in Mpouya, 0.73 in Ngabe and 2.79 in Loudima. Glossina fuscipes quazensis was the predominant tsetse fly collected in Ngabe and Mpouya, while Glossina palpalis palpalis was the only tsetse fly found in Loudima. A total of 224 (17.7%) flies were detected infected by trypanosomes; 100 (7.91%) by Trypanosoma congolense savannah, 22 (1.74%) by Trypanosoma congolense forest, 15 (1.19%) by Trypanosoma vivax, 83 (6.56%) by Trypanosoma brucei (s.l.) and 2 (0.16%) undetermined species. No T Trypanosoma brucei gambiense was found. A total of 57 co-infections between T. brucei (s.l.) and T. congolense savannah or T. brucei (s.l.) and T. congolense forest were found only in G. p. palpalis. Loudima recorded the highest number of infected tsetse flies. Conclusion: The study provided updated information on the distribution of tsetse fly populations as well as on Trypanosoma species circulating in tsetse flies in the different active HAT foci in Congo. These data suggested a high risk of potential transmission of animal trypanosomes in these foci, thus stressing the need for active surveillance in this endemic area.

TI  - Malaria transmission and major malaria vectors in different geographical areas of Southeast Asia
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE & INTERNATIONAL HEALTH
AB  - During the last decade, major progress in malaria control has been achieved in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. However, malaria is still a potentially fatal disease in some hilly-forested areas and continues to be endemic in a few coastal foci. To estimate the risk that stems from the major vectors after a decade of intensive malaria control, an entomological study based on human landing collections was conducted between April 1998 and November 2000 in six study villages (four in Vietnam, one in Cambodia and one in Laos) located in different physio-geographical areas. Five villages were selected in places where new cases of malaria still occurred. In the sixth village, in the northern hilly area of Vietnam, no case of malaria was detected during the past 3 years. In three study villages of the hilly forested areas of Cambodia and central Vietnam, Anopheles dirus A still played an important role in malaria transmission and maintain perennial transmission inside the villages despite its low density. Anopheles minimus A was found in all study villages except in the southern coastal village of Vietnam. Its role in malaria transmission, however, varied between localities and surveys. In one study village of central Vietnam it was almost absent (one specimen collected over 480 man nights), and in another village sporozoite positive specimens (2.8%) were only observed during the first two surveys whereas this species disappeared from the collections from November 1998 onwards (six surveys: 360 man nights). In the northern study site An. minimus A and C were found in all collections, but no local malaria transmission occurred. However, the constant presence of these two species associated with a high longevity (parous rate up around 80% and 65%, respectively), suggests that transmission can occur at almost any time if parasite reservoirs are reintroduced in the area. The proper management of malaria cases and population movement is, therefore, important to prevent outbreaks and the reintroduction of malaria in northern Vietnam. In the study site of the Mekong delta, An. sundaicus occurred at high densities (up to 190 bites/man/night). The recent changes in land use from rice cultivation to shrimp farming probably explains the increase of this brackish water breeding species during the study period. However, none of the 11 002 specimens was positive for Plasmodium circumsporozoite protein (CSP). The relative low survival rate as estimated by the parous rate (around 47 %) may reflect its low vectorial status that could explain the very low malaria incidence (1.9 case/100 persons/year) in this study site. A calculated sporozoite rate of maximum 1/300 000 is enough to explain this low malaria incidence. Despite the successes in malaria control, the vector An. dirus A continues to play an important role in malaria transmission, whereas An. minimus A showed temporal and spatial variation in its role as vector. The role of An. sundaicus as vector could not be confirmed because of the low incidence in the coastal study village. Other Anopheles species may be locally involved, but in the five study villages where malaria is still present they probably do not contribute significantly to malaria transmission. The study also points towards the fact that in Southeast Asia it will become increasingly difficult to incriminate Anopheles species in malaria transmission while the risk for malaria transmission still persist.

TI  - The match between microbial community structure and soil properties is modulated by land use types and sample origin within an integrated agroecosystem
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - It is of global concern to adopt measures to mitigate land degradation caused by agricultural production systems. One of the strategies proposed is to replace degraded pastures with agrosilvopastoral systems which integrate three different land-use types: crop production, livestock pasture and forestry plantation (denoted iCLF). However, little is known about the differences between iCLF and other land use types in terms of soil microbial community structure. Distance matrices based on individual soil chemical properties and individual soil microbial variables were correlated by Procrustes analysis and these relationships yielded vectors of residuals depicting these correlations (matches). These vectors were used as univariate response variables in an ANOVA framework in order to investigate how the match sizes (the strength of correlation/covariance) between individual soil chemical properties and individual soil microbial variables vary across land use types (levels: iCLF; degradated pasture; improved pasture; and a native cerrado fragment) and also across sample origin within iCLF (levels: soil samples under more influence of the exotic tree forest stand; soil samples under influence of the pasture; samples within the transition between the forest stand and the pasture). We were able to obtain insights into the fact that the land use distinction can be driven by more than just individual soil chemical and microbial variables. The integration of crop, livestock and forestry promoted a dominance of fungi in this low fertility and low pH environment. P availability and the composite variable exchangeable base cations (Ca+2, Mg+2, K+) were the soil properties whose strengths of correlation (match sizes) with individual microbial variables were the most affected by land use type and sampling origin within iCLF. While the strength of the correlation between soil microbial structure variables and P availability was typically land use type dependent, the response of the microbial structure to exchangeable base cations was mainly affected by the sample origin within iCLF. Finally our results point towards the conclusion that increases in the heterogeneity of vegetation within integrated crop, pasture and forestry systems are an important driver of microbial community response to environmental changes, and may be one means by which to increase the sustainability of tropical agroecosystems.

TI  - Diptera vectors of avian Haemosporidian parasites: untangling parasite life cycles and their taxonomy
T2  - BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS
AB  - Haemosporida is a large group of vector-borne intracellular parasites that infect amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. This group includes the different malaria parasites (Plasmodium spp.) that infect humans around the world. Our knowledge on the full life cycle of these parasites is most complete for those parasites that infect humans and, to some extent, birds. However, our current knowledge on haemosporidian life cycles is characterized by a paucity of information concerning the vector species responsible for their transmission among vertebrates. Moreover, our taxonomic and systematic knowledge of haemosporidians is far from complete, in particular because of insufficient sampling in wild vertebrates and in tropical regions. Detailed experimental studies to identify avian haemosporidian vectors are uncommon, with only a few published during the last 25 years. As such, little knowledge has accumulated on haemosporidian life cycles during the last three decades, hindering progress in ecology, evolution, and systematic studies of these avian parasites. Nonetheless, recently developed molecular tools have facilitated advances in haemosporidian research. DNA can now be extracted from vectors' blood meals and the vertebrate host identified; if the blood meal is infected by haemosporidians, the parasite's genetic lineage can also be identified. While this molecular tool should help to identify putative vector species, detailed experimental studies on vector competence are still needed. Furthermore, molecular tools have helped to refine our knowledge on Haemosporida taxonomy and systematics. Herein we review studies conducted on Diptera vectors transmitting avian haemosporidians from the late 1800s to the present. We also review work on Haemosporida taxonomy and systematics since the first application of molecular techniques and provide recommendations and suggest future research directions. Because human encroachment on natural environments brings human populations into contact with novel parasite sources, we stress that the best way to avoid emergent and reemergent diseases is through a program encompassing ecological restoration, environmental education, and enhanced understanding of the value of ecosystem services.

TI  - Applying artificial intelligence and digital health technologies, Viet Nam
T2  - BULLETIN OF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION
AB  - Problem Direct application of digital health technologies from high-income settings to low-and middle-income countries may be inappropriate due to challenges around data availability, implementation and regulation. Hence different approaches are needed.Approach Within the Viet Nam ICU Translational Applications Laboratory project, since 2018 we have been developing a wearable device for individual patient monitoring and a clinical assessment tool to improve dengue disease management. Working closely with local staff at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Ho Chi Minh City, we developed and tested a prototype of the wearable device. We obtained perspectives on design and use of the sensor from patients. To develop the assessment tool, we used existing research data sets, mapped workflows and clinical priorities, interviewed stakeholders and held workshops with hospital staff.Local setting In Viet Nam, a lower middle-income country, the health-care system is in the nascent stage of implementing digital health technologies.Relevant changes Based on patient feedback, we are altering the design of the wearable sensor to increase comfort. We built the user interface of the assessment tool based on the core functionalities selected by workshop attendees. The interface was subsequently tested for usability in an iterative manner by the clinical staff members.Lessons learntThe development and implementation of digital health technologies need an interoperable and appropriate plan for data management including collection, sharing and integration. Engagements and implementation studies should be conceptualized and conducted alongside the digital health technology development. The priorities of end-users, and understanding context and regulatory landscape are crucial for success.

Activity assays with both the full-length enzyme and a truncated, active catalytic UBC domain revealed that the extract contained inhibitory properties. Separation of the extract into individual components and additional screens identified vitexin as the active inhibitor. An IC50 for vitexin was calculated to be approximately 0.5 mM. Molecular modeling simulations were used to predict the mode of inhibition and NMR spectra were used to confirm the binding site of vitexin to E2-25K.

TI  - IMPORTANCE OF FUNGAL ROOT ROT PATHOGENS OF CASSAVA IN BENIN
T2  - PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
AB  - Cassava root rots are important diseases in different agroecological zones of West Africa. The causing pathogens were collected from 101 farmers' fields in forest mosaic savanna, southern guinea savanna, northern guinea savanna and sudan savanna of Benin were isolated, identified and analyzed for their virulence. A total of 51 isolates were found showing different disease reaction with 13.7% highly virulent, 17.6%, virulent and 13.7% moderately virulent. The potential root rot pathogens found in the agroecological zones of Benin were Botryodiplodia theobromae accounting for 66.7% (most frequently in the southern guinea savanna and the forest mosaic savanna), Fusarium solani for 11.7%, Fusarium oxysporum for 9.1%, Nattrasia mangiferae for 3.9%, Fusarium semitectum for 1.9% and Sclerotium rolfsii for 1.9%. Nattrasia mangiferae was found only in the sudan savanna at the frequency of 3.9%. Trichoderma and Rhizopus species were also found during our investigations but theirs effects were non virulent on cassava root.

TI  - Cheminformatic models based on machine learning for pyruvate kinase inhibitors of <i>Leishmania mexicana</i>
T2  - BMC BIOINFORMATICS
AB  - Background: Leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease which affects approx. 12 million individuals worldwide and caused by parasite Leishmania. The current drugs used in the treatment of Leishmaniasis are highly toxic and has seen widespread emergence of drug resistant strains which necessitates the need for the development of new therapeutic options. The high throughput screen data available has made it possible to generate computational predictive models which have the ability to assess the active scaffolds in a chemical library followed by its ADME/toxicity properties in the biological trials.
   Results: In the present study, we have used publicly available, high-throughput screen datasets of chemical moieties which have been adjudged to target the pyruvate kinase enzyme of L. mexicana (LmPK). The machine learning approach was used to create computational models capable of predicting the biological activity of novel antileishmanial compounds. Further, we evaluated the molecules using the substructure based approach to identify the common substructures contributing to their activity.
   Conclusion: We generated computational models based on machine learning methods and evaluated the performance of these models based on various statistical figures of merit. Random forest based approach was determined to be the most sensitive, better accuracy as well as ROC. We further added a substructure based approach to analyze the molecules to identify potentially enriched substructures in the active dataset. We believe that the models developed in the present study would lead to reduction in cost and length of clinical studies and hence newer drugs would appear faster in the market providing better healthcare options to the patients.

TI  - Economic burden of dengue in Indonesia
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background Dengue is associated with significant economic expenditure and it is estimated that the Asia Pacific region accounts for >50% of the global cost. Indonesia has one of the world's highest dengue burdens; Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus are the primary and secondary vectors. In the absence of local data on disease cost, this study estimated the annual economic burden during 2015 of both hospitalized and ambulatory dengue cases in Indonesia.
   Methods Total 2015 dengue costs were calculated using both prospective and retrospective methods using data from public and private hospitals and health centres in three provinces: Yogyakarta, Bali and Jakarta. Direct costs were extracted from billing systems and claims; a patient survey captured indirect and out-of-pocket costs at discharge and 2 weeks later. Adjustments across sites based on similar clinical practices and healthcare landscapes were performed to fill gaps in cost estimates. The national burden of dengue was extrapolated from provincial data using data from the three sites and applying an empirically-derived epidemiological expansion factor.
   Results Total direct and indirect costs per dengue case assessed at Yogyakarta, Bali and Jakarta were US$791, US$1,241 and US$1,250, respectively. Total 2015 economic burden of dengue in Indonesia was estimated at US$381.15 million which comprised US$355.2 million for hospitalized and US$26.2 million for ambulatory care cases.
   Conclusion Dengue imposes a substantial economic burden for Indonesian public payers and society. Complemented with an appropriate weighting method and by accounting for local specificities and practices, these data may support national level public health decision making for prevention/control of dengue in public health priority lists.
   Author summary Dengue, an infection transmitted by mosquitos, is a public health concern particularly in tropical/subtropical areas and the Asia Pacific region where it is associated with a significant cost to society. Indonesia has one of the world's highest dengue burdens but Indonesia-specific data on cost are lacking. To estimate the annual economic burden of dengue in Indonesia, this study collected data from public/private hospitals and health centres in three provinces (Yogyakarta, Bali and Jakarta) during 2015. We estimated cost of illness using the societal perspective: calculations of costs included those that were directly paid by the healthcare system, as well as costs incurred by the patients (or their family/care givers) and their lost productivity. The costs from the three provinces were then used as the basis for extrapolating cost of illness in Indonesia. The authors confirmed that dengue imposed a substantial economic burden for Indonesian public payers and society. Based on 2015 data, the authors estimated total economic burden of dengue in Indonesia at US$381.15 million. Of this, US$355.2 million related to patients treated in hospitals and US$26.2 million was for patients treated in health centres. Establishing a better understanding of the burden of dengue in Indonesia will help to guide public health decision-making at a national level and support prevention and control initiatives for this disease.

TI  - Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry for differential identification of adult<i> Schistosoma</i> worms
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
AB  - Background Schistosomiasis is a major neglected tropical disease that affects up to 250 million individuals worldwide. The diagnosis of human schistosomiasis is mainly based on the microscopic detection of the parasite's eggs in the feces (i.e., for Schistosoma mansoni or Schistosoma japonicum) or urine (i.e., for Schistosoma haematobium) samples. However, these techniques have limited sensitivity, and microscopic expertise is waning outside endemic areas. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) has become the gold standard diagnostic method for the identification of bacteria and fungi in many microbiological laboratories. Preliminary studies have recently shown promising results for parasite identification using this method. The aims of this study were to develop and validate a species-specific database for adult Schistosoma identification, and to evaluate the effects of different storage solutions (ethanol and RNAlater) on spectra profiles. Methods Adult worms (males and females) of S. mansoni and S. japonicum were obtained from experimentally infected mice. Species identification was carried out morphologically and by cytochrome oxidase 1 gene sequencing. Reference protein spectra for the creation of an in-house MALDI-TOF MS database were generated, and the database evaluated using new samples. We employed unsupervised (principal component analysis) and supervised (support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor, Random Forest, and partial least squares discriminant analysis) machine learning algorithms for the identification and differentiation of the Schistosoma species. Results All the spectra were correctly identified by internal validation. For external validation, 58 new Schistosoma samples were analyzed, of which 100% (58/58) were correctly identified to genus level (log score values >= 1.7) and 81% (47/58) were reliably identified to species level (log score values >= 2). The spectra profiles showed some differences depending on the storage solution used. All the machine learning algorithms classified the samples correctly. Conclusions MALDI-TOF MS can reliably distinguish adult S. mansoni from S. japonicum.

TI  - Malaria control using indoor residual spraying and larvivorous fish: a case study in Betul, central India
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE & INTERNATIONAL HEALTH
AB  - To assess the impact of intensified malaria control interventions in an ethnic minority community in Betul using existing tools.
   Two rounds of indoor residual spraying with synthetic pyrethroid insecticide were applied and larvivorous fish introduced, followed by intensive surveillance for early detection of Plasmodium falciparum with rapid diagnostic tests and prompt treatment with sulphadoxine pyrimethamine.
   Pre-intervention surveys revealed a very high fever rate in the community in all age groups with a slide positivity rate of > 50% with > 90%P. falciparum. The post-intervention phase showed a sharp steady decline in number of malaria cases (beta 0.972; P < 0.0001, 95% CI 0.35-0.47). Monitoring of entomological results revealed a significant decline in both Anopheles species and An. culicifacies (P < 0.0001).
   A combination of indoor residual spraying and early detection and prompt treatment complemented by rapid diagnostic tests and larvivorous fishes successfully brought malaria under control. These approaches could be applied in other regions of different endemicity to control malaria in India.

TI  - Effect of trapping methods on the estimation of alpha diversity of a phlebotomine sandfly assemblage in southern Mexico
T2  - MEDICAL AND VETERINARY ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - The aims of the study were to (a) investigate the effect of trapping methods on alpha diversity; and (b) enhance the knowledge of the sandfly assemblage in the state of Quintana Roo. Field work was undertaken in a tropical forest of southern Mexico from August 2013 to July 2014. Sampling was conducted monthly during three consecutive nights. For each trapping night, 12 different types of trap were operated from 18.00 to 24.00 hours in four transects. Measures of alpha community diversity were based on the quantification of the number of species (Chao 2, Jackknife 2, Clench's equation, Margalef's index) and the community structure, as well as the dominance (Simpson and Berger-Parker indexes) and evenness (Shannon's entropy index, true diversity of the Jost and Pielou index). With a total sampling effort of 1728 night-traps, 16 101 phlebotomine sandflies were collected; they represented two genera and 13 species. Diversity estimates of 100% (Chao 2 and Clench's equation) and 85% (Jackknife 2) of potential species in the study area were calculated. Shannon traps and CDC light traps indicated the largest number of species, but only Shannon traps showed the greatest abundance. This inventory of sandflies is an important activity to enhance our knowledge of sandfly assemblages and guilds. The ultimate goal of studying alpha diversity in sandflies would be to have a better understanding of the population dynamics and all complex networks of interactions that may, in turn, be associated with the epidemiology of the disease.

TI  - Muscodor species- endophytes with biological promise
T2  - PHYTOCHEMISTRY REVIEWS
AB  - A novel fungal genus is described that produces extremely bioactive volatile organic compounds (VOC's). The initial fungal isolate was discovered as an endophyte in Cinnamomum zeylanicum in a botanical garden in Honduras. This endophytic fungus was named Muscodor albus because of its odor and its white color. This fungus produces a mixture of VOC's that are lethal to a wide variety of plant and human pathogenic fungi and bacteria. It also is effective against nematodes and certain insects. The mixture of VOC's has been analyzed using GC/MS and consists primarily of various alcohols, acids, esters, ketones, and lipids. Final verification of the identity of the VOC's was carried out by using artificial mixtures of the putatively identified compounds and showing that the artificial mixture possessed the identical retention times and mass spectral qualities as those of the fungal derived substances. Artificial mixtures of the available VOC's mimicked some but not all of the biological effects of the fungal VOC's when tested against a wide range of fungal and bacterial pathogens. Other species and isolates of this genus have been found in various tropical forests in Australia, Bolivia, Ecuador, and Thailand. The most recent discovery is Muscodor crispans whose VOCs are active against many plant and human pathogens. Potential applications for "mycofumigation" by members of the Muscodor genus are currently being investigated and include uses for treating plant diseases, buildings, soils, agricultural produce and many more. This report will describe how the fungus was discovered, identified, and found potentially useful to agriculture, medicine and industry.

TI  - Development and Validation of a UHPLC-DAD Method for the Quantitative Analysis of Major Dihydrochalcone Glucosides from <i>Thonningia sanguinea</i> VAHL *
T2  - PLANTA MEDICA
AB  - Thonnigia sanguinea is a plant widely used in traditional African medicine against a variety of diseases. The obligate parasite is growing throughout tropical African forests and utilizes a large variety of hosts. Dihydrochalcone glucoside derivatives isolated from the subaerial parts of this plant were identified as potential antidiabetic lead compounds. In this study, an ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatographic method coupled with a photodiode array detector was developed for the quantitation of six major dihydrochalcone derivatives. The analytes were baseline separated in complex samples within 14 minutes on a Phenomenex Luna Omega 1.6 mu m C18 column using a mobile phase consisting of water and acetonitrile (each + 0.01% trifluoroacetic acid) in gradient elution. Method validation confirmed the selectivity, linearity (R (2) >= 0.9992), precision (inter-day <= 1.98%, intraday <= 2.00%), and accuracy (recovery rates of 97.4 - 106.3% for all analytes). At 280 nm, the LODs and LOQs were found to be lower than 1.42 and 4.30 mu g/mL, respectively. Eight plant batches from the northern Angolan province of Uige (collected in the wild or bought on markets) were extracted with methanol using an ultrasound-assisted extraction protocol and subsequently analyzed with the validated method. Results indicated high contents of dihydrochalcone glucosides in all eight samples. Most notably, the two bioactive constituents thonningianin A and B were present in fairly large amounts (2.42 - 5.35 w%).

TI  - Cinnamomum cassia exhibits antileishmanial activity against Leishmania donovani infection in vitro and in vivo
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background There is a pressing need for drug discovery against visceral leishmaniasis, a life-threatening protozoal infection, as the available chemotherapy is antiquated and not bereft of side effects. Plants as alternate drug resources has rewarded mankind in the past and aimed in this direction, we investigated the antileishmanial potential of Cinnamomum cassia.
   Methodology Dichloromethane, ethanolic and aqueous fractions of C. cassia bark, prepared by sequential extraction, were appraised for their anti-promastigote activity along with apoptosis-inducing potential. The most potent, C. cassia dichloromethane fraction (CBD) was evaluated for anti-amastigote efficacy in infected macrophages and nitric oxide (NO) production studied. The in vivo antileishmanial efficacy was assessed in L. donovani infected BALB/c mice and hamsters and various correlates of host protective immunity ascertained. Toxicity profile of CBD was investigated in vitro against peritoneal macrophages and in vivo via alterations in liver and kidney functions. The plant secondary metabolites present in CBD were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS).
   Principal findings CBD displayed significant anti-promastigote activity with 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 33.6 g ml(-1) that was mediated via apoptosis. This was evidenced by mitochondrial membrane depolarization, increased proportion of cells in sub-G(0)-G(1) phase, ROS production, PS externalization and DNA fragmentation (TUNEL assay). CBD also inhibited intracellular amastigote proliferation (IC50 14.06 g ml(-1)) independent of NO production. The in vivo protection achieved was 80.91% (liver) and 82.92% (spleen) in mice and 75.61% (liver) and 78.93% (spleen) in hamsters indicating its profound therapeutic efficacy. CBD exhibited direct antileishmanial activity, as it did not specifically induce a T helper type (Th)-1-polarized mileu in cured hosts. This was evidenced by insignificant modulation of NO production, lymphoproliferation, DTH (delayed type hypersensitivity), serum IgG2a and IgG1 levels and production of Th2 cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10) along with restoration of pro-inflammatory Th1 cytokines (INF-, IL-12p70) to the normal range. CBD was devoid of any toxicity in vitro as well as in vivo. The chemical constituents, cinnamaldehyde and its derivatives present in CBD may have imparted the observed antileishmanial effect.
   Conclusions Our study highlights the profound antileishmanial efficacy of C. cassia bark DCM fraction and merits its further exploration as a source of safe and effective antieishmanial compounds.
   Author summary Leishmaniasis encompasses a broad spectrum of vector-borne neglected tropical diseases with significant worldwide health impact, ranging from the self-healing cutaneous lesions to stigmatizing and disfiguring skin ulcers (mucocutaneous), and the systemic visceral manisfestations (kala azar or visceral leishmaniasis, VL). A poverty-stricken disease, VL is fatal, if left untreated and resurfaces as post-kala azar dermal leishmaniasis after several years of apparent cure. Moreover, there is an upward trend in development of resistance to most of the currently available chemotherapeutic arsenal. Absence of vaccines, progressive emergence of HIV-Leishmania co-infection delineate the gravity of VL affliction. Natural products from medicinal plants have shown leishmanicidal effect, which in some cases, is potentiated by immunomodulation. Here, we elucidate the antileishmanial efficacy of Cinnamomum cassia bark fraction (CBD) with no adverse side effects. The parasites were eliminated by apoptosis in vitro while the protection in vivo was complemented by partial immunomodulation. CBD may be used in synergy with known or pipeline drugs for effective maintenance of VL. Our study represents an important step in the regional drive towards VL elimination.

TI  - Overview of the horseflies (Diptera: Tabanidae) of South Africa: assessment of major collections for spatiotemporal analysis
T2  - AUSTRAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - Tabanidae, commonly known as horseflies, is a large, cosmopolitan family with approximately 4400 described species, of which about 400 occur in southern Africa. Both sexes feed on nectar or pollen and some species are important pollinators. Females usually require a bloodmeal to produce eggs, implicating them as vectors of disease-causing agents. Despite their importance, they have been largely neglected by science, especially in the Afrotropics. In this study, we aimed to elucidate some fundamental spatiotemporal aspects of horsefly biology in South Africa by centralising digitised data from the major natural history museums in the region. Approximately 6 000 records have been digitised and collated into a Specify database from an approximate 17 000 specimens housed in 10 museums in the region. The collections from the 10 institutions, including six collections in neighbouring countries are briefly discussed. Spatiotemporal analysis according to biomes (Albany thicket, desert, forests, fynbos, grassland, Indian Ocean belt, Kalahari savannah sub-biome, Central Bushveld sub-biome, Lowveld savannah sub-biome, Nama Karoo and Succulent karoo) revealed baseline information regarding their biology within the biomes. The majority of the records are from north eastern KwaZulu-Natal, followed by Kruger National Park and areas surrounding Cape Town, indicative of uneven sampling. The database is represented by a total of 195 species of which 83 species were recorded in only one biome, with grassland home to 28% of the biome endemic species. A species list to the region, supplemented by records from previous authors, totals to 203 species occurring in the region. Future studies should aim to digitise the remaining specimens in order to create species pages with brief descriptions, high-resolution photographs, distribution maps and spatiotemporal patterns available online.

TI  - Atmospheric Methane Condition over the South Sumatera Peatland during the COVID-19 Pandemic
T2  - AEROSOL AND AIR QUALITY RESEARCH
AB  - Recent anthropogenic activities have degraded peatlands, the largest natural reservoir of soil carbon, thereby reducing their carbon uptake from the atmosphere. As one of the primary sources of methane (CH4) emissions in terrestrial ecosystems, peatlands also contribute to atmospheric greenhouse gases. During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, Indonesia implemented a lockdown referred to as large-scale social restrictions (LSSR) in areas with high case numbers. To evaluate the effects of anthropogenic activity on peatlands, we investigated the CH4 concentrations in the atmosphere above the tropical peatlands of the Indonesian province South Sumatra before the LSSR (March 2020), during the LSSR (May 2020), and during the corresponding months of the previous year (March and May 2019). Using satellite-retrieved data from NASA, viz., the CH4 concentration and gross primary production (GPP) measured by the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) on board Aqua and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on board Terra, respectively, we discovered a decrease of approximately 5.5% in the mean CH4 concentration (which averaged 1.73 ppm across the periods prior to lockdown) as well as an increase in the GPP (which ranged from 53.3 to 63.9 g C m(-2) day(-1) during the lockdown, indicating high atmospheric carbon intake) during the LSSR. Thus, the restrictions during lockdown, which reduced anthropogenic activities, such as land use conversion and biomass burning, and related events, such as peatland and forest fires, significantly influenced the level of atmospheric CH4 above the peatlands in Indonesia.

TI  - Epidemiology of endemic Oropouche virus transmission in upper Amazonian Peru
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - A cross-sectional serosurvey of a rural community near Iquitos, Peru was conducted to determine Oropouche (ORO) virus antibody prevalence and risk factors for human infection. Venous blood samples, and demographic, social, and risk factor data were obtained from people age five years of age and older who lived in the village of Santa Clara on the Nanay River, a tributary of the Amazon River. Sera were tested for ORO viral antibody by an ELISA. The specificity of viral antibody reactivity was determined by a standard plaque-reduction neutralization test. Interview data were analyzed by univariate and multiple logistic regression to determine which variables were statistically associated with previous ORO viral infection, as indicated by the presence of IgG antibody. Final models were evaluated based on log-likelihood and Wald chi-square. Clustering of seropositive residents within houses was analyzed by the method of Waiter. Among 1,227 persons sampled, 33.7% (n = 414) were positive for ORO viral IgG antibody. Overall, antibody prevalence was similar for males (33.9%) and females (33.6%), and increased significantly with age for both sexes to include more than half of persons more than 25 years of age. The length of residence in the village was positively associated with serologic status; persons who had moved to the village within the past 15 years were less likely to be seropositive than life-long residents of the same age. Antibody prevalence among immigrants who had lived in Santa Clara more than 15 years was similar to that in life-long residents. The activity most predictive of previous ORO viral infection was travel to forest communities and travel to Iquitos. No evidence of spatial heterogeneity in ORO virus antibody distribution was observed. Results suggested that endemic transmission of ORO virus in this region has been ongoing during many decades, and that people are at considerable risk of infection.

TI  - Seasonal and altitudinal differences in coffee leaf rust epidemics on coffee berry disease-resistant varieties in Southwest Ethiopia
T2  - TROPICAL PLANT PATHOLOGY
AB  - Coffea arabica is native to the Afromontane forests of southwestern Ethiopia, the leading African country in Arabica coffee production. The intensity of coffee leaf rust (CLR), a fungal disease of growing concern to coffee farmers, was assessed in eight coffee berry disease-resistant C. arabica varieties planted at three different altitudes. Disease variables assessed were CLR prevalence (percent of infected plants), incidence (percent rusted leaves) and severity (percent leaf area affected) at four times within a year (Nov, Jan, Apr and Jun). The intensity of CLR epidemics was highest at the lowland and lowest at the highland location. We hypothesize that inoculum may be limited by cooling conditions that negatively affects fungal sporulation. CLR intensity was highest at harvest time (Nov) and decreased during the following dry season, reaching zero values in Apr and Jun. All coffee varieties were similarly susceptible to CLR. Our data suggest that more efforts should be employed by breeders to develop CLR-resistant coffee varieties, and that shifting cultivation from lower to higher altitudes may contribute to achieve to higher yields due to lower impact of CLR epidemics.

TI  - MEDICINAL-PLANTS OF SEBERIDA (RIAU PROVINCE, SUMATRA, INDONESIA)
T2  - JOURNAL OF ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY
AB  - Field enquiries on the plants used to treat diseases in villages of Seberida Municipality indicated that a large number of plant species (at least 100) are being used in therapy. Many of the uses, however, are magical in nature. Those in which a cause-effect relationship may be established (56) are presented in this paper. A review of the ethnomedical and experimental literature showed that medicinal plant uses in Seberida fall into three categories: those for which uses are corroborated by similar medicinal uses for the same plant or different species of the same genus in other cultures, those for which uses of the plant or species of the same genus are corroborated by evidence of relevant pharmacological activity in the experimental literature and those for which the medicinal uses are not corroborated. A discussion of these categories is presented. Taken as a whole, the medicinal uses of plants in Seberida are characterized by a remarkably high proportion of plants used to treat fevers and malaria and by a high proportion of species of which the leaves are used (externally or internally) for medicinal purposes. Comparison with other studies reported in the literature seems to indicate that a high frequency of the use of leaves in therapy may be a part of a larger cultural phenomenon among the tropical forest tribes of Southeast Asia and the southern Pacific Islands. Possible rationales for this type of use are offered.

TI  - Atypical manifestations of chikungunya infection
T2  - TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Chikungunya fever is a viral infection transmitted to humans by the bite of infected mosquitoes. Typical chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection results in an acute febrile illness characterized by severe joint pain and rash. Although chikungunya is generally not considered life threatening, atypical clinical manifestations resulting in significant morbidity have been documented, especially during epidemics. This review describes atypical manifestations following CHIKV infection reported in the literature, categorized as neurological, cardiovascular, skin, ocular, renal and other manifestations. The importance of vertical transmission from an infected mother resulting in neonatal infection is also highlighted. CHIKV infection can result in severe illness needing intensive care, with significant mortality. While there are many deaths reported which are directly attributable to CHIKV infection, background mortality is also increased during epidemics. In this context, considering CHIKV infection a benign and non fatal illness has to be revisited. (C) 2009 Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Implementing COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) Rapid Diagnostic Tests in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Review
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MEDICINE
AB  - Introduction: For the COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) response, COVID-19 antigen (Ag), and antibody (Ab) rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are expected to complement central molecular testing particularly in low-resource settings. The present review assesses requirements for implementation of COVID-19 RDTs in sub-Saharan Africa.
   Methods: Review of PubMed-published articles assessing COVID-19 RDTs complemented with Instructions for Use (IFU) of products.
   Results: In total 47 articles on two COVID-19 Ag RDTs and 54 COVID-19 Ab RDTs and IFUs of 20 COVID-19 Ab RDTs were retrieved. Only five COVID-19 Ab RDTs (9.3%) were assessed with capillary blood sampling at the point-of-care; none of the studies were conducted in sub-Saharan Africa. Sampling: Challenges for COVID-19 Ag RDTs include nasopharyngeal sampling (technique, biosafety) and sample stability; for COVID-19 Ab RDTs equivalence of whole blood vs. plasma/serum needs further validation (assessed for only eight (14.8%) products). Sensitivity-Specificity: sensitivity of COVID-19 Ag and Ab RDTs depend on viral load (antigen) and timeframe (antibody), respectively; COVID-19 Ab tests have lower sensitivity compared to laboratory test platforms and the kinetics of IgM and IgG are very similar. Reported specificity was high but has not yet been assessed against tropical pathogens. Kit configuration: For COVID-19 Ag RDTs, flocked swabs should be added to the kit; for COVID-19 Ab RDTs, finger prick sampling materials, transfer devices, and controls should be added (currently only supplied in 15, 5, and 1/20 products). Usability and Robustness: some COVID-19 Ab RDTs showed high proportions of faint lines (>40%) or invalid results (>20%). Shortcomings were reported for buffer vials (spills, air bubbles) and their instructions for use. Stability: storage temperature was <= 30 degrees C for all but one RDT, in-use and result stability were maximal at 1 h and 30 min, respectively. Integration in the healthcare setting requires a target product profile, landscape overview of technologies, certified manufacturing capacity, a sustainable market, and a stringent but timely regulation. In-country deployment depends on integration in the national laboratory network.
   Discussion/Conclusion: Despite these limitations, successful implementation models in triage, contact tracing, and surveillance have been proposed, in particular for COVID-19 Ab RDTs. Valuable experience is available from implementation of other disease-specific RDTs in sub-Saharan Africa.

TI  - Estimation of reference evapotranspiration via machine learning algorithms in humid and semiarid environments in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB  - Efficient agricultural water management requires accurate determination of reference evapotranspiration (ETo). Artificial intelligence has recently managed to solve several water management challenges. Acquiring suitable data sets, choosing appropriate criteria, and identifying the optimal algorithm are significant challenges in machine learning. Machine learning may be an effective tool for estimating reference evapotranspiration using minimal meteorological inputs. This work aims to estimate the amount of ETo in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa region of Pakistan, highlighted as an important agricultural hub, using machine learning. The machine learning techniques include support vector machines based on radial basis function in conjunction with a random forest, artificial neural network, and deep learning long short-term memory systems with 15 input combinations. The findings showed that all four strategies predicted ETo values with reasonable accuracy and reliability. The support vector regression model with scenario-14 revealed strong results than the others (R-2 = 0.9970). The ultimate purpose of this research is to develop the best scenarios with a reasonable accuracy rate and the least amount of input parameters to create the most suitable methodology. Hence, the second most successful models were artificial neural nets and deep learning with scenario-9 and 11, estimating ETo with a higher accuracy level (R-2= 0.9768 and 0.9688) during the testing stage. In conclusion, the research confirms the beneficial effects of support vector regression and enhanced performance of machine learning algorithms in estimating ETo in water shortage tropical and semiarid zones.

TI  - Ant navigation <i>en route</i> to the goal:: signature routes facilitate way-finding of <i>Gigantiops destructor</i>
T2  - JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PHYSIOLOGY A-NEUROETHOLOGY SENSORY NEURAL AND BEHAVIORAL PHYSIOLOGY
AB  - We investigated in laboratory conditions how foragers of the tropical ant Gigantiops destructor develop individually distinctive landmark routes. Way-finding along a familiar route involved the recognition of at least two locations, nest and feeding site, and the representation of spatial relations between these places. Familiar visual landmarks were important both at the beginning and at the end of the foraging journey. A motor routine guided the ants at the start of their foraging path towards the first landmarks, which they learnt to pass consistently on the same side, before taking the next direction. At the last stage of the route, landmark recognition allowed them to pinpoint their preferred feeding site without using distant cues or odometric information. By contrast, ants en route to the goal were not systematically guided by a stereotyped sequence of snapshots recalled at each corresponding stage of the route. Each ant slalomed in an idiosyncratic distinctive way around different midway landmarks from a foraging excursion to the next, which induced a variability of the path shapes in their intermediate parts. By reducing the number of landmark recognition-triggered responses, this economical visuomotor strategy may be helpful in the Amazonian forest where many prominent landmarks are alike.

TI  - Memory-enhancing activity of <i>Thespesia populnea</i> in rats
T2  - PHARMACEUTICAL BIOLOGY
AB  - Thespesia populnea Soland ex. Correa (Malvaceae) is a large tree found in the tropical regions and coastal forests of India. Various parts of Thespesia populnea are found to possess useful medicinal properties such as antifertility, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, purgative, and hepatoprotective activities. The current study was undertaken to investigate the effects of Thespesia populnea bark on memory in rats. Elevated plus-maze and Hebb-Williams maze served as the exteroceptive behavioral models for testing memory. Diazepam-, scopolamine-, and ageing-induced amnesia served as the interoceptive behavioral models. The ethanol extract of Thespesia populnea (TPE) was administered orally in three doses (100, 200, and 400 mg/kg) for 7 successive days to different groups of young and aged rats. TPE (200 and 400 mg/kg, p.o.) resulted in significant improvement in memory of young and aged rats. TPE also reversed the amnesia induced by scopolamine (0.4 mg/kg, i.p.) and diazepam (1 mg/kg, i.p.). Cholesterol-lowering, anticholinesterase, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties of Thespesia populnea may favorably contribute to its memory-enhancement effect. Therefore, Thespesia populnea bark appears to be a promising candidate for improving memory, and it would be worthwhile to explore the potential of this plant in the management of Alzheimer patients.

TI  - Seed removal of <i>Dipteryx alata</i> Vog. (Leguminosae: Faboidae) in the edge and interior of Cerrado
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY
AB  - Post-dispersal seed agents of mortality include pathogens, invertebrates, and vertebrates, which may shape tropical tree populations and communities. In this study I experimentally evaluated Dipteryx alata endocarp removal both in the interior and edge of Cerrado vegetation. Specifically, I simulated primary dispersion of endocarps by bats and evaluated secondary removal intensity according to habitat, season, and endocarp number. This study was developed in the Pombo Natural Municipal Park, a large Cerrado remnant with an area of 9,000 ha, located in the Western Brazil. In each of the two habitat types, I set down 45 points in which D. alata piles of 1, 3, 7, 15, and 40 endocarps were positioned. On average, endocarp removal in the interior was higher than in the edge, so that the intensity of removal varied from positive density-dependent (interior: rains), to negative density-dependent (edge: both seasons). Also, at both habitat types and seasons non removed endocarps were intensely attacked by fungus. Indeed, seed mortality by fungus infestation was positive density-dependent. The results indicate high propensity of endocarps to escape from removal in the edge, in principle, a defaunated area. As Dipteryx species strongly rely on caviomorph rodents for their dispersal, the scarcity of these vectors might reduce recruitment chances of D. alata in remnants of Cerrado. This imply in future changes in the vegetation structure from the edge to the interior towards low tree diversity.

TI  - The risk to Myrtaceae of <i>Austropuccinia psidii,</i> myrtle rust, in Mexico
T2  - FOREST PATHOLOGY
AB  - Austropuccinia psidii is a biotrophic rust fungus that affects species from the Myrtaceae family. In Mexico, Myrtaceae is widely distributed in temperate, tropical and semi-arid ecosystems, and includes 20 genera and 192 endemic and exotic species. Austropuccinia psidii has been present in Mexico for the last four decades; however, little is known about the distribution of this rust or the vulnerability of native and exotic Myrtaceae to infection. In this study, we used global occurrence records for the pandemic biotype of myrtle rust to model its current and future suitable habitat using a species distribution model, Maxent. We identified regions that are highly suitable for myrtle rust establishment, now and in the future (2050). Additionally, we identified the Myrtaceae species known to be susceptible to rust infection and that are currently distributed in areas with high rust habitat suitability. Thirty-six susceptible plant species and 142 untested species are distributed within areas of suitable rust habitat and are considered potentially at risk of rust infection. Current suitable habitat is mainly restricted to the east coast of Mexico, with Veracruz, Puebla, Chiapas, Tabasco and Oaxaca being the most vulnerable regions to the rust under current and future climates. We encourage monitoring within these regions by surveying locations where the rust occurs and within areas with high suitable habitat to determine the threat to native ecosystems and industries reliant on Myrtaceae. We also recommend screening to test the susceptibility of Myrtaceae species with no known susceptibility rating.

TI  - Sequence and phylogenetic analysis of a novel alphaendornavirus, the first virus described from the oomycete plant pathogen <i>Phytophthora heveae</i>
T2  - ARCHIVES OF VIROLOGY
AB  - Here, we report the discovery and complete genome sequence of a novel virus, designated as "Phytophthora heveae alphaendornavirus 1" (PhAEV1), from a single isolate of the plant pathogenic oomycete Phytophthora heveae (kingdom Stramenipila) isolated from a tropical evergreen lowland rainforest in northern Vietnam. PhAEV1 was detected by both cellulose affinity chromatography of dsRNA and high-throughput sequencing of total RNA, and its presence and sequence were confirmed by RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing. The PhAEV1 genome, 12,820 nucleotides (nt) in length, was predicted to encode a single large polyprotein with the catalytic core domain of viral (superfamily 1) RNA helicase (HEL, amino acid [aa] positions 1,287-1,531), glycosyltransferase (GT, aa positions ca. 2,800-3,125), and RNA-directed RNA polymerase (RdRp, aa positions 3,875-4,112). PhAEV1 is the most similar to Phytophthora cactorum alphaendornavirus 3, sharing 39.4% and 39.1% nt and aa sequence identity, respectively. In addition to the first 5'-terminal AUG codon, three additional in-frame methionine codons were found in close proximity (nt 14-16, 96-98, and 176-178), suggesting potential additional translation initiation sites. Conserved RdRp motifs (A-E) similar to those detected in related endornaviruses were identified in PhAEV1, as well as in several previously described alphaendornaviruses from other Phytophthora species in which these motifs had not been identified previously. Phylogenetic analysis showed that PhAEV1 clusters with members of the genus Alphaendornavirus in the family Endornaviridae and is basal to two other alphaendornaviruses described from another oomycete, Phytophthora cactorum. PhAEV1 is the first virus reported in P. heveae.

TI  - Predicting the Risk of Hantavirus Infection in Beijing, People's Republic of China
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - To understand the spatial distribution of hantavirus infections across landscapes and its influencing environment factors in Beijing, People's Republic of China, rodents captured in this region were examined for hantavirus by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. A total of 1,639 rodents were trapped at 86 randomly selected sites. The overall infection rate for hantavirus was 7.14% in the rodents. Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that the natural infection rates for hantavirus in rodents were significantly associated with rice agriculture (odds ratio [OR] = 2.88, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.27-30.70). orchards (OR = 1.12 95% CI = 1.02-5.96), and moderate elevation (OR = 9.83, 95% CI = 2.22-43.55). A risk map was constructed on the basis of these significant factors to predict extension and transmission of infection with hantavirus in this region.

TI  - Cryptosporiopsis leaf spot and shoot blight of eucalypts
T2  - AUSTRALASIAN PLANT PATHOLOGY
AB  - Cryptosporiopsis eucalypti has been associated with foliar disease of eucalypts in many parts of the world, especially in South-East Asia where Eucalyptus camaldulensis can be severely affected. In a field trial in southern Vietnam of 150 open-pollinated families of seven tropical provenances of E. camaldulensis, C. eucalypti was the main pathogen associated with leaf blight and crown dieback. Variation in susceptibility to foliar disease occurred at the family, provenance and sub-species levels offering excellent opportunities for selection of resistant trees. Pathogenicity tests using seedlings have shown that the fungus can infect stems as well as leaves. Stem inoculation may offer opportunities for rapid screening for resistant germplasm, but a connection between the results of such tests and field performance has not been made.

TI  - Survey of ticks of domestic dogs and cattle in three Caribbean islands
T2  - TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES
AB  - Ticks and the pathogens they transmit can cause high morbidity and mortality in domestic animals. As part of a larger study to determine the tick-borne pathogens infesting domestic animals and wildlife, the aim of this study was to survey the tick species infesting the canine and cattle populations in Trinidad, Tobago and St. Lucia. A total of 1,990 ticks were collected off 179 dogs in Trinidad (n = 163) and Tobago (n = 16) between June 2016 and 2018. Ticks were also collected from cattle throughout Trinidad (n = 1,098), Tobago (n = 306) and St. Lucia (n = 176). Collected ticks were morphologically identified using standard taxonomic keys. Tick-infested dogs were characterized as pets (n = 161) or hunting dogs (n = 18). Only two tick species, Rhipicephalus sanguineus (1,926; 96.8%) and Amblyomma ovale (64; 3.2%), were found on the dogs. A total of 169 (94.4%) dogs and 10 (5.6%) dogs were infested with R. sanguineus and A. ovale, respectively. Three dogs (1.7%) were infested with both tick species. Hunting dogs or those closely associated with them were infested with A. ovale. Rhipicephalus sanguineus was widely distributed throughout both islands, whereas A. ovale was restricted to small foci in three rural settlements in both Trinidad (n = 2) and Tobago (n = 1). Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus (n = 1,404) was the only tick species found in cattle from Trinidad (n = 62) and Tobago (n = 20), whilst R. B. microplus (n = 171) and Amblyomma variegatum (n = 5) were found infesting 14 and two heads of cattle, respectively, in St. Lucia. These preliminary findings will aid in determining whether there are links between ticks and tick-borne pathogens associated with domestic, wildlife species and humans and give further insight into the potential movement of ticks and their pathogens between the human, animal and tropical forest interface.

TI  - Antiviral activity and mechanism of action of calanolide A against the human immunodeficiency virus type-1
T2  - JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS
AB  - Calanolide A, recently discovered in extracts from the tropical rainforest tree, Calophyllum lanigerum, is a novel inhibitor of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1. The compound is essentially inactive against strains of the less common HIV type 2. The present study focused on the further characterization of the selective,antiviral activity and mechanism of action of calanolide A. The compound inhibited a wide variety of laboratory strains of HIV type 1, with EC(50) values ranging from 0.10 to 0.17 mu M. The compound similarly inhibited promonocytotropic and lymphocytotropic isolates from patients in various stages of HIV disease, as well as drug-resistant strains. Viral life-cycle studies indicated that calanolide A acted early in the infection process, similar to the known HIV reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitor 2', 3'-dideoxycytidine. In enzyme inhibition assays, calanolide A potently and selectively inhibited recombinant HIV type 1 RT but not cellular DNA polymerases or HIV type 2 RT within the concentration range tested. Serial passage of the virus in host cells exposed to increasing concentrations of calanolide A yielded a calanolide A resistant virus strain. RT from the resistant virus was not inhibited by calanolide A but retained sensitivity to other nonnucleoside as well as nucleoside RT inhibitors, including 3'-azido-2',3'-dideoxythymidine triphosphate and nevirapine. The study substantially supports the conclusion that calanolide A represents a novel subclass of nonnucleoside RT inhibitor which merits consideration for anti-HIV drug development.

TI  - Sylvatic dengue virus type 4 in <i>Aedes aegypti</i> and <i>Aedes albopictus</i> mosquitoes in an urban setting in Peninsular Malaysia
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Dengue fever is endemic in Malaysia, contributing to significant economic and health burden in the country. Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus are the main vectors of the dengue virus (DENV), which circulates in sylvatic and human transmission cycles and has been present in Malaysia for decades. The study investigated the presence and distribution of DENV in urban localities in the Klang Valley, Peninsular Malaysia. A total of 364 Ae. aegypti and 1,025 Ae. albopictus larvae, and 10 Ae. aegypti and 42 Ae. albopictus adult mosquitoes were screened for the presence of DENV. In total, 31 (2.2%) samples were positive, of which 2 Ae. albopictus larvae were co-infected with two serotypes, one with DENV-2 and DENV-3 and the other with DENV-3 and DENV-4. Phylogenetic analysis determined that the isolates belonged to DENV-1 genotype I (1 Ae. aegypti adult), DENV-2 (1 Ae. albopictus larva), DENV-3 genotype V (3 Ae. aegypti larvae and 10 Ae. albopictus larvae) and DENV-4 genotype IV (6 Ae. aegypti larvae and 12 Ae. albopictus larvae), a sylvatic strain of DENV-4 which was most closely related with sylvatic strains isolated from arboreal mosquitoes and sentinel monkeys in Peninsular Malaysia in the 1970s. All four DENV serotypes were co-circulating throughout the study period. The detection of a sylvatic strain of DENV-4 in Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus mosquitoes in urban areas in Peninsular Malaysia highlights the susceptibility of these vectors to infection with sylvatic DENV. The infectivity and vector competence of these urban mosquitoes to this strain of the virus needs further investigation, as well as the possibility of the emergence of sylvatic virus into the human transmission cycle.
   Author summary Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease that has re-emerged as a major public health problem in the 21(st) Century. The four serotypes of dengue virus are capable of infecting humans with a range of symptoms and clinical outcomes, with the change in predominating serotypes often responsible for new dengue outbreaks. In this study, we surveyed urban sites in the Klang Valley, Malaysia, for Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquito vectors and confirmed the presence of all four serotypes of the virus. We detected the presence of genotype V of dengue serotype 3, which has previously not been reported in the country, as well as a sylvatic strain of dengue serotype 4 that was closely related to strains obtained from forest-dwelling mosquito vectors and sentinel monkeys in Malaysia. The detection of a sylvatic strain of dengue virus in urban vectors raises questions over the risk of virus transmission to humans, especially with recent reports of severe clinical cases as a result of infection with sylvatic dengue virus serotypes. Further studies will be needed to determine the source and origins of these strains as well as the severity of dengue disease upon infection, especially with the development of new dengue vaccines.

TI  - Molecular characterisation and genetic affinities of Cyclophyllidean cestodes infecting wild rats in Peninsular Malaysia
T2  - TROPICAL BIOMEDICINE
AB  - Cestode infections is widely reported in rodents, however species identification remains problematic due to the genetic or interspecies variation. Therefore, this study was aimed to verify the Cyclophyllidean parasites recovered from wild rats captured from different forest types using molecular based methods. Maximum-likelihood (ML) and neighbour-joining (NJ) trees were constructed inferred from 18 small subunit nuclear ribosomal RNA gene (18SrDNA) and mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit one gene (COX1) sequences of cestode worms recovered from 124 individuals from four rat species. Sequences obtained from both Hymenolepis diminuta and Hydatigera parva represents the first records in Malaysia. All the sequences were successfully amplified with product with total length of 205 and 1202 base pairs (bp), respectively. Three cestode species from the Family Hymenolepididae (Hymenolepis diminuta) and Family Taeniidae (Hydatigera parva; Hydatigera taeniaeformis) were successfully characterized using phylogenetic analyses and haplotype networking. Phylogenetic analysis showed that H. diminuta, Hydatigera parva (Hy. parva) and Hydatigera taeniaeformis (Hy. taeniaeformis) formed its own monophyletic clade in 18SrDNA analyses. Results also showed that Hy. taeniaeformis shared the same haplotype group with Hy. taeniaeformis from China (COX1) and linked with Hy. taeniaeformis from Japan (18SrDNA) while the Malaysian H. diminuta clearly formed a separate haplotype and networked with other regions. The Malaysian Hy. parva isolation, on the other hand, appeared to be genetically distinct from the European Hy. parva (Spain) strain, but closely linked to the local isolates. Molecular methods employed successfully improved in the detection of complex species in this group. The findings showed that molecular data can be useful to deeply study intra-specific variation in other cestode worms.

TI  - The detection of Japanese encephalitis virus in Megachiropteran bats in West Kalimantan, Indonesia: A potential enzootic transmission pattern in the absence of pig holdings
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY-PARASITES AND WILDLIFE
AB  - The West Kalimantan province in Borneo island, Indonesia belongs to endemic area of Japanese encephalitis (JE) that accounts for approximately 30% of total cases yearly. As the presence of pig holdings is uncommon in West Kalimantan, another reservoir host might have played a role in the local transmission of JE virus in this area. Current study aimed to identify the potential role of bats in the local transmission of JE by performing molecular detection of JE virus in bats and mosquitoes using RT-PCR. Sample collection was performed in 3 districts in West Kalimantan, covering 3 different ecosystems: forest, coastal, and residential areas. Bat collection was performed using mist net and harp net, while mosquito collection was carried out using animal-baited trap and human landing collection. A total of 373 blood samples from bats were tested for JE virus, among which 21 samples (5.6%) showed positive results, mainly from Cynopterus brachyotis (lesser short-nosed fruit bat) found in residential areas. Out of 53 mosquito pools, 3 JE-positive pools of Culex tritaeniorhynchus and Cx. vishnui were collected at the same location as JE-positive bats. Current study showed the first evidence of JE virus detection in several species of Megachiropteran bats in Indonesia, demonstrated the potential role of frugivorous bats in local transmission of JE in West Kalimantan. More aggressive measures are required in JE risk mitigation, particularly in initiating JE vaccination campaign and in avoiding disruption of bats' natural habitats through changes in land-use.

TI  - MALARIA TRANSMISSION AT A NEW IRRIGATION PROJECT IN SRI-LANKA - THE EMERGENCE OF ANOPHELES-ANNULARIS AS A MAJOR VECTOR
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Malaria transmission was studied in a newly irrigated area of the Mahaweli project in the dry zone of Sri Lanka. Observations were performed for a three-month period following the northeast monsoon. Parasitemia in the population varied from 20.2% in February to 7% in May, and infection was due to both Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax. Night catches of mosquitoes collected with human bait included a high proportion of Anopheles annularis. Mosquitoes containing sporozoites in the salivary glands were identified by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Anopheles culicifacies, An. annularis, and An. aconitus were all implicated as vectors in the area. The highest entomologic inoculation rate, 0.12 infected bites/hr, was observed with An. annularis and P. vivax in March. We suggest that a change in the ecosystem from dry zone forest to irrigated cultivated land is the cause of the increased prevalence of An. annularis in this area and its emergence as a major vector of malaria.

TI  - Tannins, flavonoids and stilbenes in extracts of African savanna woodland trees <i>Terminalia brownii, Terminalia laxiflora</i> and <i>Anogeissus leiocarpus</i> showing promising antibacterial potential
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
AB  - Terminalia laxiflora, Terminalia brownii and Anogeissus leiocarpus are used as decoctions, macerations, infusions and fumigations in East and West African traditional medicine for treatment of infectious diseases and their symptoms. Using this ethnopharmacological information as a guideline for our research and owing to the fact that these species have not been subjected to in depth antibacterial and phytochemical studies, thirty-nine extracts of various polarities of the stem bark, stem wood and roots were studied for growth inhibitory effects against the human pathogenic bacteria Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Our results indicate that the studied species contain antibacterial compounds of a wide range of polarities. All polar root extracts of T. laxiflora and various polar extracts of T. brownii roots, including hot water decoctions, gave broad-spectrum antibacterial effects and low MIC values of 39 mu g/ml. The main ellagitannins in an ethyl acetate extract of the root of T. laxiflora were found to be corilagin and its derivative and punicalagin. A methanol extract of the roots of T. brownii contained methyl-(S)-flavogallonate and its derivative as the main identified ellagitannins. Moreover, both Terminalia species were found to contain ellagic acid xylopyranoside and methyl ellagic acid xyloside and pure ellagic acid was present in T. brownii. Pure punicalagin did not give as low MIC as an ethyl acetate extract of the roots of T. laxiflora, containing punicalagin as one of its main compounds, although this ellagitannin totally inhibited the growth of S. aureus at 125 mu g/ml and P. aeruginosa at 500 mu g/ml. Similarly, pure ellagic and gallic acid gave higher MIC values than the methanolic root extract of T. brownii against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. Moreover, a Sephadex LH-20 fraction of the methanolic extract of the roots of T. brownii, enrichedwithmethyl-(S)-flavogallonate and its isomer, gave higher MIC values than the crude methanolic extract. These results suggest that the polyphenols in the extracts might act synergistically with each other. A methanolic soxhlet extract of the roots of A. leiocarpus, containing ampelopsin, aromadendrin, taxifolin, pinosylvin and 4'-methylpinosylvin gave a low MIC value of 39 mu g/ml against all bacterial strains used in this investigation. Our results demonstrate that the roots, stem bark and stem wood of T. brownii, T. laxiflora and A. leiocarpus are rich sources of (new) antimicrobial compounds and justify the uses of these plants for treatment of infections in African traditional medicine.

TI  - NEW FINDINGS ON THE POLLINATION BIOLOGY OF <i>MAURITIA FLEXUOSA</i> (ARECACEAE) IN RORAIMA, BRAZIL: LINKING DIOECY, WIND, AND HABITAT
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
AB  - Premise of the study: Despite the ecological, economic, and cultural importance of the palm Mauritia flexuosa in Amazonia, knowledge of its reproductive biology is scarce. Previous observations of this species suggested beetles as the probable pollinator, but experimental work to confirm this hypothesis was lacking.
   Methods: We investigated the floral biology and pollination of M. flexuosa in undisturbed forest, undisturbed savanna/forest ecotone, and fragmented savanna within plantations of the exotic tree, Acacia mangium, in northern Brazilian Amazonia. In each habitat, we examined floral biology, combined floral visitor observations with laboratory analyses, and performed anemophily and exclusion experiments.
   Key results: Fruit set was significantly greater in the visitor exclusion treatment than in the wind + visitor exclusion treatment and significantly lower in the wind + visitor exclusion treatment than the open control, but there was no difference in fruit set between the visitor exclusion treatment and the control. We found no significant difference in pollen dispersal among the three habitats. The presence of A. mangium appears to have no immediate effect on pollination of M. flexuosa, although it may indirectly affect other aspects of this native's reproductive ecology.
   Conclusions: Floral visitors of M. flexuosa are not pollinators. This dioecious palm depends on wind as its primary pollen vector. Wind pollination is not necessarily most effective in open habitats. These findings are important because they re-evaluate traditional assumptions of wind pollination and can improve management strategies of this natural resource in the Amazon.

TI  - PARASITOLOGICAL AND CLINICAL CHARACTERIZATION OF SIMULIUM-NEAVEI TRANSMITTED ONCHOCERCIASIS IN WESTERN UGANDA
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND PARASITOLOGY
AB  - In the forests of western Uganda onchocerciasis is transmitted by Simulium neavei s.s. Since little is known about the infection transmitted by this vector, a survey was made in 1991 with special regard to adult persons of 15 years and older in the 13 villages of the parish Kigoyera 40 km northeast of Fort Portal. 3268 (52 %) of the 6271 registered inhabitants were examined clinically and parasitologically. - The highest microfilaria (mf) densities were found on the buttocks, lower ones on the shoulders and the lowest on the ankles. In the parish the standardised prevalence of mf carriers was 62 %. The crude prevalences of adult mf carriers ranged from 80 % to 95 % in the 13 villages. Densities of 100 mf/snip or more were found in 25 % of male persons. The community microfilarial load (CMFL) in skin snips from the buttocks was 49 mf/snip, ranging from 22 to 93 in the 13 villages. - The standardised prevalence of nodule carriers was 25 % and the mean nodule load was 1.9 nodules per nodule carrier. Among 3420 nodules 90 % were found on the pelvic girdle. - The standardised prevalence of onchocercal dermatitis was 19 %. The crude rates ranged within the age groups in males from 20 % to 45 % and in females from 16 % to 41 %. The standardised prevalence of persons presenting mf in the anterior chamber of the eye was 24 % and the CMFL in the anterior chamber ranged between 1.2 and 3.3 mf/chamber in six villages. Standardised rates were 1.6 % for sclerosing keratitis and 0.9 % for reduced vision of 3/60 or less. These prevalences of eye lesions are comparable to those observed in West African forest areas. - The CMFLs and the prevalences of mf and nodule carriers represent suitable criteria for community diagnosis of S. neavei-transmitted onchocerciasis in Uganda to guide ivermectin treatment, whereas the prevalence of ''leopard skin'' is not useful. Immigrants living less than five years in the endemic focus should be excluded from the assessment of mf carrier rates and those living there less than ten years from rapid assessment of nodule carrier rates.

A1  - Cochrane Covid 19 Diagnost
TI  - Thoracic imaging tests for the diagnosis of COVID-19
T2  - COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS
AB  - Background
   The diagnosis of infection by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) presents major challenges. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing is used to diagnose a current infection, but its utility as a reference standard is constrained by sampling errors, limited sensitivity (71% to 98%), and dependence on the timing of specimen collection. Chest imaging tests are being used in the diagnosis of COVID-19 disease, or when RT-PCR testing is unavailable.
   Objectives
   To determine the diagnostic accuracy of chest imaging (computed tomography (CT), X-ray and ultrasound) in people with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.
   Search methods
   We searched the COVID-19 Living Evidence Database from the University of Bern, the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, and The Stephen B. Thacker CDC Library. In addition, we checked repositories of COVID-19 publications. We did not apply any language restrictions. We conducted searches for this review iteration up to 5 May 2020.
   Selection criteria
   We included studies of all designs that produce estimates of test accuracy or provide data from which estimates can be computed. We included two types of cross-sectional designs: a) where all patients suspected of the target condition enter the study through the same route and b) where it is not clear up front who has and who does not have the target condition, or where the patients with the target condition are recruited in a different way or from a different population from the patients without the target condition. When studies used a variety of reference standards, we included all of them.
   Data collection and analysis
   We screened studies and extracted data independently, in duplicate. We also assessed the risk of bias and applicability concerns independently, in duplicate, using the QUADAS-2 checklist and presented the results of estimated sensitivity and specificity, using paired forest plots, and summarised in tables. We used a hierarchical meta-analysis model where appropriate. We presented uncertainty of the accuracy estimates using 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
   Main results
   We included 84 studies, falling into two categories: studies with participants with confirmed diagnoses of COVID-19 at the time of recruitment (71 studies with 6331 participants) and studies with participants suspected of COVID-19 (13 studies with 1948 participants, including three case-control studies with 549 cases and controls). Chest CT was evaluated in 78 studies (8105 participants), chest X-ray in nine studies (682 COVID-19 cases), and chest ultrasound in two studies (32 COVID-19 cases). All evaluations of chest X-ray and ultrasound were conducted in studies with confirmed diagnoses only. Twenty-five per cent (21/84) of all studies were available only as preprints, 15/71 studies in the confirmed cases group and 6/13 of the studies in the suspected group.
   Among 71 studies that included confirmed cases, 41 studies had included symptomatic cases only, 25 studies had included cases regardless of their symptoms, five studies had included asymptomatic cases only, three of which included a combination of confirmed and suspected cases. Seventy studies were conducted in Asia, 2 in Europe, 2 in North America and one in South America. Fifty-one studies included inpatients while the remaining 24 studies were conducted in mixed or unclear settings. Risk of bias was high in most studies, mainly due to concerns about selection of participants and applicability.
   Among the 13 studies that included suspected cases, nine studies were conducted in Asia, and one in Europe. Seven studies included inpatients while the remaining three studies were conducted in mixed or unclear settings.
   In studies that included confirmed cases the pooled sensitivity of chest CT was 93.1% (95%CI: 90.2 - 95.0 (65 studies, 5759 cases); and for X-ray 82.1% (95%CI: 62.5 to 92.7 (9 studies, 682 cases). Heterogeneity judged by visual assessment of the ROC plots was considerable. Two studies evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of point-of-care ultrasound and both reported zero false negatives (with 10 and 22 participants having undergone ultrasound, respectively). These studies only reported True Positive and False Negative data, therefore it was not possible to pool and derive estimates of specificity.
   In studies that included suspected cases, the pooled sensitivity of CT was 86.2% (95%CI: 71.9 to 93.8 (13 studies, 2346 participants) and specificity was 18.1% (95%CI: 3.71 to 55.8). Heterogeneity judged by visual assessment of the forest plots was high.
   Chest CT may give approximately the same proportion of positive results for patients with and without a SARS-CoV-2 infection: the chances of getting a positive CT result are 86% (95% CI: 72 to 94) in patient with a SARS-CoV-2 infection and 82% (95% CI: 44 to 96) in patients without.
   Authors' conclusions
   The uncertainty resulting from the poor study quality and the heterogeneity of included studies limit our ability to confidently draw conclusions based on our results. Our findings indicate that chest CT is sensitive but not specific for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in suspected patients, meaning that CT may not be capable of differentiating SARS-CoV-2 infection from other causes of respiratory illness. This low specificity could also be the result of the poor sensitivity of the reference standard (RT-PCR), as CT could potentially be more sensitive than RT-PCR in some cases. Because of limited data, accuracy estimates of chest X-ray and ultrasound of the lungs for the diagnosis of COVID-19 should be carefully interpreted.
   Future diagnostic accuracy studies should avoid cases-only studies and pre-define positive imaging findings. Planned updates of this review will aim to: increase precision around the accuracy estimates for CT (ideally with low risk of bias studies); obtain further data to inform accuracy of chest X rays and ultrasound; and continue to search for studies that fulfil secondary objectives to inform the utility of imaging along different diagnostic pathways.

TI  - Environmental, socio-demographic and behavioural determinants of malaria risk in the western Kenyan highlands: a case-control study
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE & INTERNATIONAL HEALTH
AB  - OBJECTIVE To identify risk factors for uncomplicated malaria in highland areas of East Africa at higher risk of malaria epidemics, in order to design appropriate interventions.
   METHODS Prospective, population-based, case-control study in the Nandi Hills, a highland area of western Kenya, to identify environmental, sociodemographic and behavioural factors associated with clinical malaria. Data were collected using field observation, a structured questionnaire, and a global positioning system device.
   RESULTS We interviewed 488 cases of slide-confirmed malaria and 980 age-matched controls. Multivariate analyses associated higher malaria risk with living < 250 m of a forest [OR = 3.3 (95% CI 1.5, 7.1)], < 250 m of a swamp [2.8 (1.3, 5.9)], < 200 m of maize fields [2.0 (1.2, 3.4)], in the absence of trees < 200 m [1.6 (1.2, 2.2)], on flat land [1.6 (1.2, 2.2)], in houses without ceilings [1.5 (1.1, 2.2)], in houses with a separate kitchen building [1.8 (1.4, 2.3)] and in households where the female household head had no education [1.9 (1.1, 3.1)]. Travelling out of the study site [2.2 (1.2, 4.1)] was also associated with increased risk.
   CONCLUSIONS In this East African highland area, risk of developing uncomplicated malaria was multifactorial with a risk factor profile similar to that in endemic regions. Households within close proximity to forest and swamp borders are at higher risk of malaria and should be included in indoor residual spraying campaigns.

TI  - Sandfly fauna and ecological analysis of Phlebotomus orientalis and Phlebotomus martini in the lowland foci of visceral leishmaniasis in Somali Regional State, southeast Ethiopia
T2  - ASIAN PACIFIC JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE
AB  - Objective: To identify the sandfly fauna and analyze ecology of sandfly vector(s) of visceral leishmaniasis in three districts of Somali Regional State, southeast Ethiopia. Methods: Sandflies were collected from four sampling habitats, including indoor, peri-domestic, farm field and mixed forest using light and sticky traps in July 2016, and February and April 2017 in Liben and Dawa zones in the Somali Regional State, southeastern Ethiopia. Results: In total, 4 367 sandfly specimens, belonging to 12 species (three Phlebotomus spp. and nine Sergentomyia spp.) were identified. Phlebotomus (P.) heischi, P. orientalis, and P. martini constituted 45.7%, 31.1%, and 23.1% of the sandfly collection, respectively. There were significant differences in the median number of P. orientalis, and P. martini captured per CDC trap/night between the three sampling districts (P<0.05). In light trap capture, collection habitats had significant effects on the abundance of P. orientalis, and P. martini (P<0.05). More median numbers of P. orientalis, and P. martini species were collected in agricultural fields followed by mixed forest and peri-domestic habitats. P. orientalis and P. martini were caught more in outdoor than indoor habitats, suggesting exophilic behaviour. Conclusions: The study demonstrated that the presence of P. orientalis and P. martini are probable vectors of visceral leishmaniasis in this new focus. The findings of our study will improve the understanding of the dynamics of visceral leishmaniasis transmission and will facilitate the implementation of integrated disease control measures based on ecological knowledge of visceral leishmaniasis vector in Liben and Dawa zones and its surrounding regions.

TI  - The coffee leaf rust pathogen <i>Hemileia vastatrix</i>: one and a half centuries around the tropics
T2  - MOLECULAR PLANT PATHOLOGY
AB  - Taxonomy and HistoryHemileia vastatrix Berk. and Broome (Basidiomycota, Pucciniales) was described in 1869 in eastern Africa and Ceylon as the agent of coffee leaf rust and has spread to all coffee cultivation areas worldwide. Major disease outbreaks in Asia, Africa and America caused and continue to cause severe yield losses, making this the most important disease of Arabica coffee, a cash crop for many tropical and sub-tropical countries.
   Life cycle and Disease symptomsHemileia vastatrix is a hemicyclic fungus with the urediniosporic life cycle as its most important (if not only) source of inoculum. Chlorotic spots are the first macroscopic symptoms, preceding the differentiation of suprastomatal, bouquet-shaped, orange-coloured uredinia. The disease can cause yield losses of up to 35% and have a polyetic epidemiological impact on subsequent years.
   Disease controlAlthough the use of fungicides is one of the preferred immediate control measures, the use of resistant cultivars is considered to be the most effective and durable disease control strategy. The discovery of Hibrido de Timor' provided sources of resistance that have been used in several breeding programmes and that have been proven to be effective and durable, as some have been in use for more than 30 years.
   Genetic diversity and Molecular pathogenicityAlthough exhibiting limited genetic polymorphism, the very large genome of H. vastatrix (c. 797 Mbp) conceals great pathological diversity, with more than 50 physiological races. Gene expression studies have revealed a very precocious activation of signalling pathways and production of putative effectors, suggesting that the plant-fungus dialogue starts as early as at the germ tube stage, and have provided clues for the identification of avr genes.

TI  - A new wilt disease of <i>Acacia nilotica</i> caused by <i>Fusarium oxysporum</i>
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL FOREST SCIENCE
AB  - This paper reports a new vascular wilt disease of Acacia nilotica seedlings caused by Fusarium oxysporum. The affected seedlings exhibited varied symptoms Such as drooping of leaves at the tip or side twigs, top dying, mortality and in some cases recovery in the form of new shoots. Browning of vascular tissue and clogging of xylem vessels by mycelium and spores of fungus as well as gums were associated with diseased plants. The disease caused more mortality in seedlings raised in polythene bags (33.7%) than those in root trainers (16.9%). The source of infection was found to be soil borne and not seed borne. The pathogenicity of F oxysporum was confirmed in the laboratory by artificial inoculation. Of the seven fungicides tested, Bavistin and Benlate inhibited pathogen growth completely in culture at 0.1% concentration. Soil drenching with Thiram (0.05%), followed by seed dressing with Bavistin (0.05%), gave the best growth performance of seedlings as well as inhibition of disease in root trainers.

TI  - Integral Use of Immunopeptidomics and Immunoinformatics for the Characterization of Antigen Presentation and Rational Identification of BoLA-DR-Presented Peptides and Epitopes
T2  - JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY
AB  - MHC peptide binding and presentation is the most selective event defining the landscape of T cell epitopes. Consequently, understanding the diversity of MHC alleles in a given population and the parameters that define the set of ligands that can be bound and presented by each of these alleles (the immunopeptidome) has an enormous impact on our capacity to predict and manipulate the potential of protein Ags to elicit functional T cell responses. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of MHC-eluted ligand data has proven to be a powerful technique for identifying such peptidomes, and methods integrating such data for prediction of Ag presentation have reached a high level of accuracy for both MHC class I and class II. In this study, we demonstrate how these techniques and prediction methods can be readily extended to the bovine leukocyte Ag class II DR locus (BoLA-DR). BoLA-DR binding motifs were characterized by eluted ligand data derived from bovine cell lines expressing a range of DRB3 alleles prevalent in Holstein-Friesian populations. The model generated (NetBoLAIIpan, available as a Web server at www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetBoLAIIpan) was shown to have unprecedented predictive power to identify known BoLA-DR-restricted CD4 epitopes. In summary, the results demonstrate the power of an integrated approach combining advanced mass spectrometry peptidomics with immunoinformatics for characterization of the BoLA-DR Ag presentation system and provide a prediction tool that can be used to assist in rational evaluation and selection of bovine CD4 T cell epitopes.

TI  - Concurrent dengue and malaria in the Amazon region
T2  - REVISTA DA SOCIEDADE BRASILEIRA DE MEDICINA TROPICAL
AB  - Introduction: The Amazon region has extensive forested areas and natural ecosystems, providing favorable conditions for the existence of innumerous arboviruses. Over 200 arboviruses have been isolated in Brazil and about 40 are associated with human disease. Four out of 40 are considered to be of public health importance in Brazil: Dengue viruses (1-4), Oropouche, Mayaro and Yellow Fever. Along with these viruses, about 98% of the malaria cases are restricted to the Legal Amazon region. Methods: This study aimed to investigate the presence of arboviruses in 111 clinical serum samples from patients living in Novo Repartimento (Para), Placido de Castro (Acre), Porto Velho (Rondonia) and Oiapoque (Amapa). The viral RNA was extracted and RT-PCR was performed followed by a Multiplex-Nested-PCR, using Flavivirus, Alphavirus and Orthobunyavirus generic and species-specific primers. Results: Dengue virus serotype 2 was detected in two patients living in Novo Repartimento (Para) that also presented active Plasmodium vivax infection. Conclusions: Despite scant data, this situation is likely to occur more frequently than detected in the Amazon region. Finally, it is important to remember that both diseases have similar clinical findings, thus the diagnosis could be made concomitantly for dengue and malaria in patients living or returning from areas where both diseases are endemic or during dengue outbreaks.

TI  - A Randomized, Single-Ascending-Dose, Ivermectin-Controlled, Double-Blind Study of Moxidectin in <i>Onchocerca volvulus</i> Infection
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background: Control of onchocerciasis as a public health problem in Africa relies on annual mass ivermectin distribution. New tools are needed to achieve elimination of infection. This study determined in a small number of Onchocerca volvulus infected individuals whether moxidectin, a veterinary anthelminthic, is safe enough to administer it in a future large study to further characterize moxidectin's safety and efficacy. Effects on the parasite were also assessed.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Men and women from a forest area in South-eastern Ghana without ivermectin mass distribution received a single oral dose of 2 mg (N = 44), 4 mg (N=45) or 8 mg (N=38) moxidectin or 150 mu g/kg ivermectin (N = 45) with 18 months follow up. All ivermectin and 97%-100% of moxidectin treated participants had Mazzotti reactions. Statistically significantly higher percentages of participants treated with 8 mg moxidectin than participants treated with ivermectin experienced pruritus (87% vs. 56%), rash (63% vs. 42%), increased pulse rate (61% vs. 36%) and decreased mean arterial pressure upon 2 minutes standing still after >= 5 minutes supine relative to pre-treatment (61% vs. 27%). These reactions resolved without treatment. In the 8 mg moxidectin and ivermectin arms, the mean +/- SD number of microfilariae/mg skin were 22.9 +/- 21.1 and 21.2 +/- 16.4 pre-treatment and 0.0 +/- 0.0 and 1.1 +/- 4.2 at nadir reached 1 and 3 months after treatment, respectively. At 6 months, values were 0.0 +/- 0.0 and 1.6 +/- 4.5, at 12 months 0.4 +/- 0.9 and 3.4 +/- 4.4 and at 18 months 1.8 +/- 3.3 and 4.0 +/- 4.8, respectively, in the 8 mg moxidectin and ivermectin arm. The reduction from pre-treatment values was significantly higher after 8 mg moxidectin than after ivermectin treatment throughout follow up (p<0.01).
   Conclusions/Significance: The 8 mg dose of moxidectin was safe enough to initiate the large study. Provided its results confirm those from this study, availability of moxidectin to control programmes could help them achieve onchocerciasis elimination objectives.

TI  - Effect of shade tree planting and soil management on rehabilitation success of a 22-year-old degraded cocoa (<i>Theobroma cacao</i> L.) plantation
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Since productivity of current cocoa plantations is stagnating or declining, increasing global demand for cocoa products puts pressure on tropical, primary forests to be cut for new plantations. To address this problem, sustainable increase of cocoa yield on current plantations is needed. On a 22-year-old, 61 ha cocoa plantation in peninsular Malaysia, shade tree planting and soil management treatments, including targeted mineral fertilization, intense organic fertilization and combinations of these with compost application and cover crop (Centrosema pubescens) planting, were assessed as a rehabilitation strategy of degraded cocoa plantations with sub-optimum yield. Treatment effects on cocoa yield and on proxy indicators soil fauna abundance and diversity, and soil nutrient status, was tested 3.5 years after implementation in four harvesting rounds between 28 November 2014 and 12 March 2015. Across all treatments, large differences were found in the yield of the two clones tested (PBC130 and PBC123). The effect of shade trees (mainly Musa sp., with some permanent shade trees) on yield interacted with the factor 'clone'. Mean wet bean yield of PBC123 trees in full-sun cultivation was 0.74 kg as compared with 1.08 kg for trees in the agroforestry system (46% increase). Mean wet bean yield of PBC130 trees, however, was 20% lower in the same agroforestry system (0.08 kg) in comparison with mean wet bean yield of trees in full-sun cultivation (0.10 kg). Soil management treatments did not result in clear yield improvement as compared with common-practice, control plots. However, cover crop treatment had a positive effect on proxy indicators soil nutrient status and endogeic soil fauna diversity. It is concluded that in the rehabilitation of degraded cocoa plantations, possible yield impact of applying a straightforward agroforestry system, as the one in our experiments, is high. Furthermore, it was shown that in a degraded plantation with a long history of intensive fertilization, improved soil management has little effect. Positive effects of shade trees on cocoa yield are therefore probably linked with the creation of an environment that improves cocoa crop physiology and reduces pressure of pests and diseases, rather than with the improvement of soil quality as a consequence of intercropping with trees.

TI  - Seroprevalence of leptospirosis and risk factor analysis in flood-prone rural areas in Lao PDR
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - A cross-sectional seroprevalence study on leptospirosis, using microscopic agglutination test (MAT), was conducted in rural villages in Khammouane Province, Lao People's Democratic Republic, in December 2006. The overall prevalence of leptospiral infection among 406 subjects was 23.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] 19.7-28.0%). Independent risk factors for the infection, identified by multivariate logistic regression, were male sex (odds ratio [OR], 1.92; 95% CI: 1.24-2.98), recent flooding on one's own property (OR, 2.12; 95% CI: 1.25-3.58), and collecting wood in the forest (OR, 1.90; 95% CI: 1.17-3.09). Age, occupation, and animal ownership were not associated with seropositivity. Flooding was associated with the risk of infection particularly for women, whose behaviors or activities involving contact with floodwater were presumed to play an important role. This study showed that leptospirosis is endemic in Khammouane Province and that local flooding plays an important role in the transmission of the disease.

TI  - On frogs, toxins and true friendship: an atypical case report
T2  - JOURNAL OF VENOMOUS ANIMALS AND TOXINS INCLUDING TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - The authors report a series of events including the scientific interest for poisonous dendrobates of French Guiana, the human confrontation with the immensity of the evergreen rainforest, the fragility of the best-prepared individuals to a rough life, and the unique and very special manifestation of a solid friendship between two experts and enthusiasts of outdoor life. In the evergreen forest of South America, as in many other scientific field expeditions, everything may suddenly go wrong, and nothing can prepare researchers to accidents that may occur in a succession of uncontrollable errors once the first mistake is done. This is what happened during an expedition in search for dendrobates by an experienced forest guide and naturalist. The authors decided to report the story, considering that it deserved to be brought to the attention of those interested in venomous animals and toxins, in order to illustrate the potential danger of dealing with these organisms.

TI  - Whole genome sequencing of Gir cattle for identifying polymorphisms and loci under selection
T2  - GENOME
AB  - Genetic variation in Gir cattle (Bos indicus) has so far not been well characterized. In this study, we used whole genome sequencing of three Gir bulls and a pooled sample from another 11 bulls to identify polymorphisms and loci under selection. A total of 9 990 733 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 604 308 insertion/deletions (indels) were discovered in Gir samples, of which 62.34% and 83.62%, respectively, are previously unknown. Moreover, we detected 79 putative selective sweeps using the sequence data of the pooled sample. One of the most striking sweeps harbours several genes belonging to the cathelicidin gene family, such as CAMP, CATHL1, CATHL2, and CATHL3, which are related to pathogen-and parasite-resistance. Another interesting region harbours genes encoding mitogen-activated protein kinases, which are involved in directing cellular responses to a variety of stimuli, such as osmotic stress and heat shock. These findings are particularly interesting because Gir is resistant to hot temperatures and tropical diseases. This initial selective sweep analysis of Gir cattle has revealed a number of loci that could be important for their adaptation to tropical climates.

T2  - REVISTA DA SOCIEDADE BRASILEIRA DE MEDICINA TROPICAL
AB  - Introduction: The presence of American cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL) in the communities of the Campus FIOCRUZ Mata Atlantica (CFMA) in the City of Rio de Janeiro initiated the investigation of the Phlebotominae fauna in the Atlantic Forest to determine the occurrence of putative ACL vectors associated with the enzootic cycle. Methods: For 24 consecutive months, sand flies were captured inside the forest and in the border area near the communities. Results: The following sand fly species were identified: Brumptomyia brumpti, Brumptomyia cunhai, Brumptomyia nitzulescui, Lutzomyia edwardsi, Lutzomyia pelloni, and Lutzomyia quinquefer. Other identified sand fly vectors, such as Lutzomyia intermedia (the predominant species), Lutzomyia migonei, Lutzomyia whitmani, Lutzomyia fischeri, and Lutzomyia hirsuta hirsuta, are associated with ACL transmission, and the vector for American visceral leishmaniases (AVL), Lutzomyia longipalpis, was also found. Conclusions: All sand fly vectors were found in both studied environments except for Lutzomyia whitmani, which was only identified in the forest. This study represents the first identification of Lutzomyia longipalpis in the CFMA, and the epidemiological implications are discussed.

TI  - A rat model for human T lymphocyte virus type I-associated myeloneuropathy -: Down-regulation of <i>bcl</i>-2 expression and increase in sensitivity to TNF-α of the spinal oligodendrocytes
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEUROIMMUNOLOGY
AB  - We reported that the tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) expression and apoptotic death of oligodendrocytes appeared to be a major pathogenesis of the demyelination of spinal cords of Wistar-King-Aptekman-Hokudai (WKAH) rats with human T lymphocyte virus type I (HTLV-I) infection, HAM rats. In the present study, we examined the sensitivity to TNF-alpha-induced cell death of in vitro-separated oligodendrocytes from HTLV-I-infected WKAH rats. Although the number of non-viable oligodendrocytes increased by adding recombinant TNF-alpha, in a dose-dependent manner, in both HTLV-I-infected and uninfected control rats, oligodendrocytes from the infected rats were more susceptible to TNF-alpha. In situ detection of DNA fragmentation showed apoptotic death of oligodendrocytes. The expression of bcl-2, an anti-apoptotic gene, was strongly down-regulated in oligodendrocytes of the infected rats but not in the control rats. We suggest that the down-regulation of bcl-2 expression in the oligodendrocytes of the HTLV-I-infected rats may increase the susceptibility to TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis of oligodendrocytes, the result being development of HTLV-I-induced myeloneuropathy in rats.

TI  - Impact of Drying Processes on Phenolics and In Vitro Health-Related Activities of Indigenous Plants in Thailand
T2  - PLANTS-BASEL
AB  - Thailand has vast areas of tropical forests with many indigenous plants, but limited information is available on their phytochemical profile and in vitro inhibitions of enzymatic and nonenzymatic reactions. This study investigated phenolic profiles using liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS), antioxidant activities, and in vitro inhibitory activities of 10 indigenous plants on key enzymes related to obesity (lipase), diabetes (alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase), and Alzheimer's disease (cholinesterases and beta-secretase). The nonenzymatic anti-glycation reaction was also investigated. The 10 indigenous plants were Albizia lebbeck (L.) Benth, Alpinia malaccensis (Burm.) Roscoe, Careya arborea Roxb., Diplazium esculentum (Retz.) Swartz, Kaempferia roscoeana Wall., Millettia brandisiana Kurz., Momordica charantia, Phyllanthus emblica L., Zingiber cassumunar Roxb, and Zingiber citriodorum J. Mood & T. Theleide. Preparations were made by either freeze-drying or oven-drying processes. Results suggested that the drying processes had a minor impact on in vitro inhibitions of enzymatic and nonenzymatic reactions (<4-fold difference). P. emblica was the most potent antioxidant provider with high anti-glycation activity (>80% inhibition using the extract concentration of <= 6 mg/mL), while D. esculentum effectively inhibited beta-secretase activity (>80% inhibition using the extract concentration of 10 mg/mL). C. arborea exhibited the highest inhibitory activities against lipase (47-51% inhibition using the extract concentration of 1 mg/mL) and cholinesterases (>60% inhibition using the extract concentration of 2 mg/mL), while Mi. brandisiana dominantly provided alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (>80% inhibition using the extract concentration of <= 2 mg/mL). Information obtained from this research may support usage of the oven-drying method due to its lower cost and easier preparation step for these studied plant species and plant parts. Furthermore, the information on in vitro inhibitions of enzymatic and nonenzymatic reactions could be used as fundamental knowledge for further investigations into other biological activities such as cell culture or in vivo experiments of these health-beneficial plants.

TI  - Isopropyl quinoxaline-7-carboxylate 1,4-di-<i>N-</i>oxide derivatives induce regulated necrosis-like cell death on <i>Leishmania</i> (<i>Leishmania</i>) <i>mexicana</i>
T2  - PARASITOLOGY RESEARCH
AB  - Leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by the parasite of the genus Leishmania. About 13 million people are infected worldwide, and it is estimated that 350 million are at risk of infection. Clinical manifestations depend on the parasite species and factors related to the host such as the immune system, nutrition, housing, and financial resources. Available treatments have severe side effects; therefore, research currently focuses on finding more active and less toxic compounds. Quinoxalines have been described as promising alternatives. In this context, 17 isopropyl quinoxaline-7-carboxylate 1,4-di-N-oxide derivatives were evaluated as potential leishmanicidal agents. Their effect on the cell metabolism of Leishmania mexicana promastigotes and their cytotoxic effects on the J774.A1 cell line and on erythrocytes were evaluated, and their selectivity index was calculated. Compounds T-069 (IC50 = 1.49 mu g/mL), T-070 (IC50 = 1.71 mu g/mL), T-072 (IC50 = 6.62 mu g/mL), T-073 (IC50 = 1.25 mu g/mL), T-085 (IC50 = 0.74 mu g/mL), and T-116 (IC50 = 0.88 mu g/mL) were the most active against L. mexicana promastigotes and their mechanism of action was characterized by flow cytometry and microscopy. Compound T-073, the most selective quinoxaline derivative, induced cell membrane damage, phosphatidylserine exposition, reactive oxygen species production, disruption of the mitochondrion membrane potential, and DNA fragmentation, all in a dose-dependent manner, indicating the induction of regulated necrosis. Light and transmission electron microscopy showed the drastic morphological changes induced and the mitochondrion as the most sensitive organelle in response to T-073. This study describes the mechanism by which active isopropyl quinoxaline-7-carboxylate 1,4-di-N-oxide quinoxalines affect the parasite.

TI  - Intracellular zinc flux causes reactive oxygen species mediated mitochondrial dysfunction leading to cell death in <i>Leishmania donovani</i>
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania parasite is a global threat to public health and one of the most neglected tropical diseases. Therefore, the discovery of novel drug targets and effective drug is a major challenge and an important goal. Leishmania is an obligate intracellular parasite that alternates between sand fly and human host. To survive and establish infections, Leishmania parasites scavenge and internalize nutrients from the host. Nevertheless, host cells presents mechanism like nutrient restriction to inhibit microbial growth and control infection. Zinc is crucial for cellular growth and disruption in its homeostasis hinders growth and survival in many cells. However, little is known about the role of zinc in Leishmania growth and survival. In this study, the effect of zinc on the growth and survival of L. donovani was analyzed by both Zinc-depletion and Zinc-supplementation using Zinc-specific chelator N, N, N', N'-tetrakis (2-pyridylmethyl) ethylenediamine (TPEN) and Zinc Sulfate (ZnSO4). Treatment of parasites with TPEN rather than ZnSO4 had significantly affected the growth in a dose-and time-dependent manner. The pre-treatment of promastigotes with TPEN resulted into reduced host-parasite interaction as indicated by decreased association index. Zn depletion resulted into flux in intracellular labile Zn pool and increased in ROS generation correlated with decreased intracellular total thiol and retention of plasma membrane integrity without phosphatidylserine exposure in TPEN treated promastigotes. We also observed that TPEN-induced Zn depletion resulted into collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential which is associated with increase in cytosolic calcium and cytochrome-c. DNA fragmentation analysis showed increased DNA fragments in Zn-depleted cells. In summary, intracellular Zn depletion in the L. donovani promastigotes led to ROS-mediated caspase-independent mitochondrial dysfunction resulting into apoptosis-like cell death. Therefore, cellular zinc homeostasis in Leishmania can be explored for new drug targets and chemotherapeutics to control Leishmanial growth and disease progression.

TI  - Mode of Action of the Sesquiterpene Lactones Psilostachyin and Psilostachyin C on <i>Trypanosoma cruzi</i>
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Trypanosoma cruzi is the causative agent of Chagas' disease, which is a major endemic disease in Latin America and is recognized by the WHO as one of the 17 neglected tropical diseases in the world. Psilostachyin and psilostachyin C, two sesquiterpene lactones isolated from Ambrosia spp., have been demonstrated to have trypanocidal activity. Considering both the potential therapeutic targets present in the parasite, and the several mechanisms of action proposed for sesquiterpene lactones, the aim of this work was to characterize the mode of action of psilostachyin and psilostachyin C on Trypanosoma cruzi and to identify the possible targets for these molecules. Psilostachyin and psilostachyin C were isolated from Ambrosia tenuifolia and Ambrosia scabra, respectively. Interaction of sesquiterpene lactones with hemin, the induction of oxidative stress, the inhibition of cruzipain and trypanothione reductase and their ability to inhibit sterol biosynthesis were evaluated. The induction of cell death by apoptosis was also evaluated by analyzing phosphatidylserine exposure detected using annexin-V/propidium iodide, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, assessed with Rhodamine 123 and nuclear DNA fragmentation evaluated by the TUNEL assay. Both STLs were capable of interacting with hemin. Psilostachyin increased about 5 times the generation of reactive oxygen species in Trypanosoma cruzi after a 4h treatment, unlike psilostachyin C which induced an increase in reactive oxygen species levels of only 1.5 times. Only psilostachyin C was able to inhibit the biosynthesis of ergosterol, causing an accumulation of squalene. Both sesquiterpene lactones induced parasite death by apoptosis. Upon evaluating the combination of both compounds, and additive trypanocidal effect was observed. Despite their structural similarity, both sesquiterpene lactones exerted their anti-T. cruzi activity through interaction with different targets. Psilostachyin accomplished its antiparasitic effect by interacting with hemin, while psilostachyin C interfered with sterol synthesis.

T2  - GLOBAL CONGRESS ON ICM: LESSONS LEARNED TO ADDRESS NEW CHALLENGES, VOLS. 1 AND 2
CP  - Global Congress on Integrated Coastal Management (ICM) - Lessons Learned to Address New Challenges
AB  - The collection of marine, freshwater and tropical fishes in Varna Aquarium maintained by the scientists of the Institute of Fish Resources (IFR) at the Agricultural Academy gives the up-to-date image of the oldest aquarium on the Balkans. It is relatively small to be considered for a long-term preservation. The future requires implementation of joint international programs aiming at the formation of bigger viable populations. However, at this stage Varna Aquarium offers a unique opportunity for species preservation - a process comprising research work and promotion of knowledge about behaviour, genetics, diseases, reproduction, habitats and environmental factors for the life of fish.
   This article discusses activities carried out in compliance with the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), methods applied and results achieved in the field of protection and conservation of the Black Sea genetic fund.
   The activities in the Aquarium are going on under the incessant biodiversity reduction and increase of the factors with a negative impact on the Black Sea.
   Investigations of IFR scientists during recent years have outlined dynamic changes in the climate as a consequence of the anthropogenic eutrophication, overfishing, negative impact of invasive species, unstable marine ecosystem, the observed reduction and fragmentation of the areas.
   This tendency does not bypass the work in Varna Aquarium under conditions of continuous reduction of the Black Sea fish species composition and the increase of their number in the Red Book. Fish live collection replenishment is getting more and more difficult.
   The Aquarium is an organization using a complex approach for species conservation in compliance with the Convention on Biological Diversity. The main principles of the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA), the European Association of Zoos and Aquariums (EAZA) and the World Zoo and Aquarium Conservation Strategy (WZACS) are applied.

TI  - Population genomics of two invasive mosquitoes (<i>Aedes aegypti</i> and <i>Aedes albopictus</i>) from the Indo-Pacific
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Author summary The mosquitoesAe.aegyptiandAe.albopictusare highly invasive and transmit dengue and other arboviruses. This study investigates the genetics of these mosquitoes in the Indo-Pacific region, where 70% of global dengue transmission occurs and where both species have established widespread invasions by hitch-hiking on human transport vessels. We compared patterns of genetic differentiation to determine the pathways these species have taken while spreading through the Indo-Pacific, and to better understand how they disperse. We sequenced DNA from 480 mosquitoes sampled from 27 locations in the Indo-Pacific, and found many genetic differences between the two species. Populations ofAe.aegypti, which is not native to the region, tended to be genetically different from each other, and populations in the Pacific Ocean were particularly divergent.Aedes albopictuspopulations were generally more similar to each other, though genetically different populations in Sri Lanka and Indonesia point to these having a different history to other populations. Genetic differences betweenAe.aegyptipopulations were larger when populations were geographically distant, while differences betweenAe.albopictuspopulations were larger when populations likely had limited access to human transportation. These results will help improve strategies for controlling these species and stopping their spread around the world.
   The arbovirus vectorsAedes aegypti(yellow fever mosquito) andAe.albopictus(Asian tiger mosquito) are both common throughout the Indo-Pacific region, where 70% of global dengue transmission occurs. ForAe.aegyptiall Indo-Pacific populations are invasive, having spread from an initial native range of Africa, while forAe.albopictusthe Indo-Pacific includes invasive populations and those from the native range: putatively, India to Japan to Southeast Asia. This study analyses the population genomics of 480 of these mosquitoes sampled from 27 locations in the Indo-Pacific. We investigated patterns of genome-wide genetic differentiation to compare pathways of invasion and ongoing gene flow in both species, and to compare invasive and native-range populations ofAe.albopictus. We also tested landscape genomic hypotheses that genetic differentiation would increase with geographical distance and be lower between locations with high connectivity to human transportation routes, the primary means of dispersal at these scales. We found that genetic distances were generally higher inAe.aegypti, with Pacific populations the most highly differentiated. The most differentiatedAe.albopictuspopulations were in Vanuatu, Indonesia and Sri Lanka, the latter two representing potential native-range populations and potential cryptic subspeciation respectively. Genetic distances inAe.aegyptiincreased with geographical distance, while inAe.albopictusthey decreased with higher connectivity to human transportation routes. Contrary to the situation inAe.aegypti, we found evidence of long-distanceAe.albopictuscolonisation events, including colonisation of Mauritius from East Asia and of Fiji from Southeast Asia. These direct genomic comparisons indicate likely differences in dispersal ecology in these species, despite their broadly sympatric distributions and similar use of human transport to disperse. Our findings will assist biosecurity operations to trace the source of invasive material and for biocontrol operations that benefit from matching genetic backgrounds of released and local populations.

TI  - Exploring global and country-level barriers to an effective supply of leishmaniasis medicines and diagnostics in eastern Africa: a qualitative study
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Objectives To understand stakeholders' perceptions of the access barriers to quality-assured diagnostics and medicines for leishmaniasis in the high-burden region of eastern Africa, and to identify key bottlenecks to improve the supply of commodities for neglected tropical diseases.
   Design Desk reviews and qualitative in-depth interview study with purposive sampling.
   Methods A landscape analysis through literature and desk review was performed. Next, 29 representatives from international organisations, non-governmental agencies, national control programmes from six countries (Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan and Uganda) and manufacturers were interviewed between May and July 2018. Participants were selected purposively and expanded through a snowballing technique. Data analysis was aided by NVivo, applying the framework method as a part of the thematic content analysis approach.
   Results The barriers along the visceral leishmaniasis (VL) supply chain were identified as emerging themes, grouped across supply chain activities and health systems component(s). Stakeholders expressed the perception of progress, but bottlenecks persist. VL medicines, in general, lack multisource production capacity and with small market volume, expansion of suppliers is difficult. Procurement is plagued by forecasting difficulties, complex regulatory policies and procedures, and distribution challenges. Weak communication and coordination across different levels resulted in shortages and loss of trust among different actors. Cross-cutting issues spanned from limited political and resource commitment due to low awareness and limited in-country capacity. However, study respondents were optimistic to pursue several remedies, most importantly to build bridges between supply and demand sides through continued dialogue and collaborations. Diagnostics supply has mostly been overlooked; thus, improved investment in this area is needed.
   Conclusions Addressing supply barriers in eastern Africa requires consistent, specific efforts at the global and national levels, progressing from current partnerships and agreements. Priority actions include pooled procurement, improved forecast, and increased commitment and resources. Sustainability remains an elusive goal, yet to be integrated into discussions moving forward.

TI  - Genetic Relationships and Spatial Genetic Structure Among Populations of <i>Rhodnius prolixus</i> (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) in Colombia and Venezuela Based on Mitochondrial Cytochrome-b Sequences
T2  - NEOTROPICAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - One hundred twenty Rhodnius prolixus (Stal) (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) specimens from 6 Colombian Departments and 1 Venezuelan State had 594-bp of the mitochondrial cytochrome-b gene sequenced to improve the understanding of evolutionary processes that shape the main vector of Chagas disease. The levels of genetic diversity for this species were low-medium with reference to other bugs. The genetic heterogeneity among the populations was very limited which means there has been extensive gene flow and/or very recent split processes. The overall sample as well as some individual populations showed evidence of recent population expansions (with the exception of Arauca, which yielded evidence of a bottleneck for a mismatch distribution). This expansion (11,000 or 2000-25,000 year ago depending of two procedures employed) coincides with the ending of the last intense glacial conditions during the Pleistocene and the beginning of the Holocene that had a warmer and wetter climate. Some of our autocorrelation analyses (AIDA and Genetic Landscape Interpolation Analysis) indicated local patches of high genetic similarity but no globally significant spatial structure. We did show an original haplotype distributed throughout the entirety of the geographical area studied.

TI  - Ecological aspects of the free-living ticks (Acari: Ixodidae) on animal trails within Atlantic rainforest in south-eastern Brazil
T2  - ANNALS OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND PARASITOLOGY
AB  - In a recent ecological study of the ticks on animal trails within an area of Atlantic rainforest in south-eastern Brazil, Amblyomma aureolatum, A. brasiliense, A. incisum, A. ovale and Haemaphysalis juxtakochi were found questing on the vegetation. Most of the ticks recorded by a small, man-made dam on the forest border were A. dubitatum but a few A. brasiliense and A. cajennense, one A. incisum and one H. juxtakochi were also found. The seasonal activity of the ticks indicated that A. incisum and A. brasiliense had one generation/year.
   On the animal trails, most tick species and stages quested on the vegetation at a height of 30-40 cm above ground level. The questing larvae and adults of A. incisum tended to be found higher, however, with the greatest numbers recorded 40-50 cm (larvae) or 60-70 cm (adults) above ground level. Most of the adult ticks (81.1% -100%), nymphs (78.6%-100%) and larval clusters (100%) found on a forest trail remained questing at the same location over a 24-h period.
   Carbon-dioxide traps in the rainforest attracted, 50% of the ticks observed questing on the nearby vegetation and, curiously, the CO2 traps set deep in the forest attracted far fewer ticks than similar traps set by the dam.
   The ecological relationships between the ticks, their hosts and the rainforest environment are discussed.

TI  - Comparative cyto-genotoxicity and clastogenicity properties of traditional trypanocidal <i>Afrormosia laxiflora</i> and <i>Lonchocarpus laxiflorus</i> plants in Wistar rats
T2  - TOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCES
AB  - ObjectiveExpensiveness of trypanocides triggered the use of plants decoction as a therapeutic option after safety validation. We evaluated the cyto-genotoxic and clastogenic effects of antitrypanosomal plants; Lonchocarpus laxiflorus (LL) and Afrormosia laxiflora (AL) and their impact on hepatic metabolomics in Wistar rats.MethodsThe IC50 was determined based on malondialdehyde (MDA) level (ex vivo). This was followed by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), 8-hydroxy-2 '-deoxyguanosine (8OHDG), DNA fragmentation (DF) and micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes (MNPCEs) determinations. Hepatic metabolites of exposed rats to the said plants' extracts were identified by LC-MS coupled with a positive control group treated with sodium arsenite (SA).ResultsThe IC50s of LL and AL are 2.545 and 5.693 mu g/ml, respectively, for liver tissue and 4.440 and 5.877 mu g/ml, respectively, for bone marrow tissue. In bone marrow tissue, low cyto-genotoxicity potentials based on LDH and 8OHDG levels as compared with SA were observed. At in vivo level, we observed significant (p < 0.05) reduction of MDA, LDH, 8OHDG, DF and MNPCEs levels relative to SA-treated rats. Based on metabolomics, tyrosine, sphingolipid and glycerophospholipid metabolic pathways were likely activated in SA-treated group and shut down in LL- and AL-treated groups with concomitant stabilization of sphingolipid metabolism in SA + LL- and SA + AL-treated rats. However, AL-treated group showed activation of phenylalanine metabolism. ConclusionAltogether, AL depicts insignificant (p > 0.05) cyto-genotoxicity and ability to cause chromosomal breakage ex vivo and in vivo, indicating that decoction of AL appears to be safe for the treatment of human trypanosomiasis.

TI  - Dolphin communication during widespread systematic noise reduction-a natural experiment amid COVID-19 lockdowns
T2  - FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Underwater noise from human activities is recognized as a world-wide problem, with important repercussions on the acoustic communication of aquatic mammals. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the government of Panama went into a nationwide lockdown to limit the spread of the virus. This lockdown resulted in the closing of tourism infrastructure and limited mobility in both land and coastal areas. We used this "natural experiment" as an opportunity to study the impact of tour-boat activities on dolphin communication by using passive acoustic monitoring data collected before and during the lockdown at Dolphin Bay, Bocas del Toro, Panama. During the lockdown, tour-boat activity was absent, but boats transporting people and supplies were allowed to circulate. The shift in type of boat activity within the lockdown resulted in lower ambient noise levels and more frequent detections of dolphin sounds. We also detected a more diverse whistle repertoire during the lockdown than in the pre-lockdown period, even when accounting for variation in sample coverage. A Random Forest Analysis classified whistles between the two periods with high accuracy (92.4% accuracy, & kappa; = 0.85) based primarily on whistle modulation and duration. During the lockdown, whistles were longer in duration and less modulated than pre-lockdown. Our study shows that a shift in boat traffic activity can generate significant changes in dolphin habitat, and in their communicative signals, an important consideration given ongoing unregulated ecotourism in the region.

TI  - The Health Impact Fund: making the case for engagement with pharmaceutical laboratories in Brazil, Russia, India, and China
T2  - GLOBALIZATION AND HEALTH
AB  - Despite progress in global health, the general disease burden still disproportionately falls on low- and middle-income countries. The health needs of these countries' populations are unmet because there is a shortage in drug research and development, as well as a lack of access to essential drugs. This health disparity is especially problematic for diseases associated with poverty, namely neglected tropical diseases and microbial infections. Currently, the pharmaceutical landscape focuses on innovations determined by profit margins and intellectual property protection. To expand drug accessibility and catalyze research and development for neglected diseases, a team of researchers proposed the Health Impact Fund as a potential solution. However, the fund is predominantly considering partnerships with pharmaceutical giants in high-income countries. This commentary explores the limitations and benefits in partnering with pharmaceutical companies based in Brazil, Russia, India, and China (BRIC), with the goal of expanding the Health Impact Fund's vision to incorporate long-term, local partnerships. Identified limitations to a BRIC country partnership include lower levels of drug development expertise compared to their high-income pharmaceutical counterparts, and whether the Health Impact Fund and the participating stakeholders have the financial capability to assist in bringing a new drug to market. However, potential benefits include the creation of new incentives to fuel competitive local innovation, more equitable routes to drug discovery and development, and a product pipeline that could involve stakeholders in lower- and middle-income countries. Our commentary explores how partnership with pharmaceutical firms in BRIC countries might be advantageous for all: The Health Impact Fund, pharmaceutical companies in BRIC economies, and stakeholders in low- and middle- income countries.

TI  - Prevalence of <i>Cryptosporidium</i> and other enteric parasites among wild non-human primates in Polonnaruwa, Sri Lanka
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Cryptosporidiosis is a rapidly emerging disease in the tropics. This is the first report of Cryptosporidium and other protozoan infections (Entamoeba spp., lodamoeba, Chilomastix, and Balantidium Spp.) in wild primates that inhabit the natural forest of Sri Lanka. It is unclear if non-human primates serve as a reservoir for these parasites under certain conditions. A cross-sectional coprologic survey among 125 monkeys (89 toque macaques, 21 gray langurs, and 1.5 purple-faced langurs) indicated that Cryptosporidium was detected in all three primate species and was most common among monkeys using areas and water that had been heavily soiled by human feces and livestock. Most macaques (96%) ;shedding Cryptosporidium oocysts were co-infected with other protozoans and important anthropozoonotic gastrointestinal parasites (e.g., Enterobius and Strongyloides). The transmission of these parasites among primates in the wild may have important implications for public health as well as wildlife conservation management.

TI  - The development of <i>Panstrongylus herreri</i> under fluctuating environmental conditions
T2  - REVISTA DA SOCIEDADE BRASILEIRA DE MEDICINA TROPICAL
AB  - Introduction: Panstrongylus herreri is a main Chagas disease vector, and its success as a vector stems from its ability to establish domiciliated colonies; we aimed to explore its biology and reproduction. Methods: The average amount of blood ingested and the time from the beginning of a blood meal to the production of feces were recorded. Results: Females exhibited a higher blood ingestion rate than males, but similar defecation times and frequencies were observed. Conclusions: Despite the detected decrease in oviposition rates, P. herreri's potential as a Chagas disease vector in environments other than the Amazon forest cannot be discounted.

TI  - Assessment of the status of improved F&E trachoma control practices among children of agro-pastoralists in Southern Ethiopia: a mixed design survey using theory of triadic influences
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - BackgroundEthiopia is one of the countries with heavy trachoma burdens states globally. More than 75 million people in Ethiopia live in the trachoma endemic zones. Most populations with neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) live in hard-to-reach residences because of landscape and socio-cultural variances. This survey assessed the status of improved Face hygiene and Environmental cleanliness (F&E) trachoma control practices in children 1-9 years of age.MethodsA mixed-method study design was applied concurrently. Enumeration was done through interviews using the standard tool and observational technique. Focus Group discussions (FGDs) and Key informant Interviews (KIIs) were used to conduct the qualitative arm. Confounders were controlled by modeling with multivariable logistic regression.ResultsFor the Quantitative survey: The response rate was 99.8% of participants. The proportion with improved practice was 8%. About 13.9% of a child washed their faces and were visibly clean. About 15.2% of the households had an observable clean environment. High Wealth index, Perceived ability, knowledge about trachoma transmission from person to person, and stance toward preventive behavior were associated with improved practices. The odds of having improved F&E practice were 67% lower for those who reported positive normative preventive behavior than negatives. Qualitative arm: Some key informants reported village dwellers' shortage of basic knowledge; attitude and behavioral change for improved hygienic practices are the challenges. Inhabitants, including elder children, are aware of the hygiene issue though they do not practice it or have no intention to practice it.ConclusionsImproved F&E practices were much lower in the study region than the regional plan to achieve.

TI  - A genomic snapshot of <i>Salmonella enterica</i> serovar Typhi in Colombia
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Author summarySalmonella Typhi is the causative agent of typhoid fever, with between 9-13 million cases and 116,800 associated deaths annually. Typhoid fever is still a public health problem mainly in low and middle-income countries (LMICs), including in Latin America, which has a modelled incidence of up to 169 (32-642) cases per 100,000 person-years. Several international studies have aimed to fill data gaps regarding the global distribution and genetic landscape of typhoid; however, in spite of these efforts Latin America is still underrepresented. The globally dominant lineages of S. Typhi (e.g., H58), which often carry multi-drug resistance (MDR) plasmids, decreased fluoroquinolone susceptibility, and now azithromycin resistance, are not detectable by the accepted method (PFGE) used to track outbreaks of typhoid in Latin America. We compared PFGE with whole genome sequence (WGS) and found it correlated poorly, resulting in the over clustering of cases. We additionally found that unlike in most endemic countries, S. Typhi in Colombia are highly antimicrobial susceptible and restricted to a limited number of genotypes that are not as commonly identified in other S. Typhi endemic countries. Our study provides the first enhanced insights into the molecular epidemiology of S. Typhi in Colombia, using WGS data for the first time to investigate the population structure in Colombia and identifying predominant circulating genotypes. Our work demonstrates that routine surveillance with the integration of WGS is necessary not only to improve disease burden estimates, but also to track the national and regional transmission dynamics of S. Typhi.
   Little is known about the genetic diversity of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) circulating in Latin America. It has been observed that typhoid fever is still endemic in this part of the world; however, a lack of standardized blood culture surveillance across Latin American makes estimating the true disease burden problematic. The Colombian National Health Service established a surveillance system for tracking bacterial pathogens, including S. Typhi, in 2006. Here, we characterized 77 representative Colombian S. Typhi isolates collected between 1997 and 2018 using pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE; the accepted genotyping method in Latin America) and whole genome sequencing (WGS). We found that the main S. Typhi clades circulating in Colombia were clades 2.5 and 3.5. Notably, the sequenced S. Typhi isolates from Colombia were closely related in a global phylogeny. Consequently, these data suggest that these are endemic clades circulating in Colombia. We found that AMR in S. Typhi in Colombia was uncommon, with a small subset of organisms exhibiting mutations associated with reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones. This is the first time that S. Typhi isolated from Colombia have been characterized by WGS, and after comparing these data with those generated using PFGE, we conclude that PFGE is unsuitable for tracking S. Typhi clones and mapping transmission. The genetic diversity of pathogens such as S. Typhi is limited in Latin America and should be targeted for future surveillance studies incorporating WGS.

TI  - Spatial analysis of leishmaniasis in Brazil: a systematized review
T2  - REVISTA DO INSTITUTO DE MEDICINA TROPICAL DE SAO PAULO
AB  - The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review of scientific papers that used spatial analysis tools in cases of leishmaniasis, in Brazil. The search for articles was carried out in PubMed, SciELO, Scopus and Web of Science databases. The keywords used in the identification of the articles were Thematic map AND Leishmaniasis, Spatial analysis AND Leishmaniasis, and Geoprocessing AND Leishmaniasis. in English language. A total of 360 articles were found. and 11 of them were analyzed after screening by title and abstract as well as reading of the full articles. The States studied were Sao Paulo, Acre, Maranhao, Piaui, Minas Gerais, Parana and Tocantins. Cutaneous leishmaniasis occurred predominantly in rural areas, with clusters in forest reserve regions or modified forest areas. Conversely, visceral leishmaniasis mainly occurred in peripheral and central urban areas associated with poorer environments and urban infrastructure, including worse sanitation. We conclude that the spatial distribution of leishmaniasis is closely related to the living environment of the risk population. The analyzed articles associated geospatial data with some risk factors for the disease, pointing out the locations where most cases occur, creating a relevant source to define control strategies.

TI  - Serological Evidence of <i>Orthopoxvirus</i> Infection in Neotropical Primates in Brazil
T2  - PATHOGENS
AB  - The genus Orthopoxvirus (OPXV) of the family Poxviridae comprises several viruses that are capable of infecting a wide range of hosts. One of the most widespread OPXVs is the Vaccinia virus (VACV), which circulates in zoonotic cycles in South America, especially in Brazil, infecting domestic and wild animals and humans and causing economic losses as well as impacting public health. Despite this, little is known about the presence and/or exposure of neotropical primates to orthopoxviruses in the country. In this study, we report the results of a search for evidence of OPVX infections in neotropical free-living primates in the state of Minas Gerais, southeast Brazil. The sera or liver tissues of 63 neotropical primates were examined through plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNT) and real-time PCR. OPXV-specific neutralizing antibodies were detected in two sera (4.5%) from Callithrix penicillata, showing 55% and 85% reduction in plaque counts, evidencing their previous exposure to the virus. Both individuals were collected in urban areas. All real-time PCR assays were negative. This is the first time that evidence of OPXV exposure has been detected in C. penicillata, a species that usually lives at the interface between cities and forests, increasing risks of zoonotic transmissions through spillover/spillback events. In this way, studies on the circulation of OPXV in neotropical free-living primates are necessary, especially now, with the monkeypox virus being detected in new regions of the planet.

TI  - The increasing severity of circumpacific natural disasters
T2  - INTERNATIONAL GEOLOGY REVIEW
CP  - Annual Meeting of the American-Association-for-the-Advancement-of-Science
AB  - The Ring of Fire guards the margins of the continents and island arcs bordering the Pacific Ocean. Active volcanic belts dominate the terrestrial landscape. and about 100 km off-shore, oceanic trenches parallel the volcanoes. This topographically rugged, geologically unstable transition separating subaerial and submerged portions of the solid Earth is a reflection of convergent and transform lithospherie plate boundaries. The plates themselves are carried along by thermally driven mantle convection. Slow but inexorable differential motions along the plate junctions are responsible for the globe's most intense seismic activity as well as deadly eruptions. Tsunamis, avalanches, mudflows. and catastrophic land subsidence are common associates in this dynamic geologic realm. Moreover. the world's greatest ocean-a heat-transfer engine driven convectively by incoming solar radiation-spawns the most powerful tropical storms, producing devastating coastal flooding. Nowhere is the Pacific Rim free of these natural hazards. As the burgeoning populations of the Circumpacific nations occupy and more intensively develop and degrade ever-larger tracts along the Rim, the aggregate vulnerability of society to natural hazards will increase. To the extent that these same Circumpacific nations increasingly influence global economic systems, the cascade of suffering produced by episodic natural disasters and the rapid transmission of communicable diseases inevitably will produce more substantial financial as well as human and material losses. We can mitigate but not eliminate the adverse effects of natural hazards through a more complete understanding of their fundamental scientific causes, and by planning accordingly. But natural disaster reduction must be coordinated across and transcend political boundaries if we are to be more effective in the future.

TI  - Supporting elimination of lymphatic filariasis in Samoa by predicting locations of residual infection using machine learning and geostatistics
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - The global elimination of lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a major focus of the World Health Organization. One key challenge is locating residual infections that can perpetuate the transmission cycle. We show how a targeted sampling strategy using predictions from a geospatial model, combining random forests and geostatistics, can improve the sampling efficiency for identifying locations with high infection prevalence. Predictions were made based on the household locations of infected persons identified from previous surveys, and environmental variables relevant to mosquito density. Results show that targeting sampling using model predictions would have allowed 52% of infections to be identified by sampling just 17.7% of households. The odds ratio for identifying an infected individual in a household at a predicted high risk compared to a predicted low risk location was 10.2 (95% CI 4.2-22.8). This study provides evidence that a 'one size fits all' approach is unlikely to yield optimal results when making programmatic decisions based on model predictions. Instead, model assumptions and definitions should be tailored to each situation based on the objective of the surveillance program. When predictions are used in the context of the program objectives, they can result in a dramatic improvement in the efficiency of locating infected individuals.

TI  - Retracing the contours of the early angiosperm environmental niche
T2  - ANNALS OF BOTANY
AB  - Background and Aims Our aim was to understand the environmental conditions of the emergence and radiation of early angiosperms. Such a question has long remained controversial because various approaches applied in the past have drawn conflicting images of early angiosperm ecology.
   Methods We provided a new perspective on the question by using support vector machines to model the environmental niche of 51 species belonging to ten genera of extant lineages that diverged early during angiosperm evolution (basal angiosperms). Then, we analysed the resulting pattern of niche overlap and determined whether this pattern deviates from what would be expected on the basis of a null model or whether it might mirror a legacy of a common primitive niche based on a phylogenetic reconstruction.
   Key Results The niche of three-quarters of the species and all genera converged towards tropical montane cloud forests (TMCFs). The latitudinal pattern of basal angiosperm richness indeed culminated in the tropics, and the elevational pattern revealed a humpback curve peaking between 2000 m and 3500 m when accounting for the effect of area. At first glance, this diversity pattern does not significantly differ from null predictions. However, we revealed a tendency for the basal-most taxa to occur in TMCFs so that phylogenetic reconstructions indicated that the niche of the common ancestor of the sampled basal angiosperms had a probability of 0.85-0.93 to overlap with TMCFs.
   Conclusions Our new approach indicates that the environmental convergence of extant basal angiosperms towards TMCFs would reflect a legacy of an ancestral niche from which the least basal taxa would have diverged following a random pattern under geometric constraints.

A1  - Nigeria Natl Blindness Visual Impa
TI  - Ecological determinants of blindness in Nigeria: The Nigeria National Blindness and Visual Impairment Survey
T2  - SAMJ SOUTH AFRICAN MEDICAL JOURNAL
AB  - Objective. To determine the prevalence and causes of visual loss in different ecological zones across Nigeria.
   Methods. A population-based survey using multi-stage, stratified, cluster random sampling with probability proportional to size comprising a nationally representative sample of adults aged 40 years from six ecological zones.
   Outcome measures. Distance vision was measured using reduced logMAR charts. Clinical examination included basic eye examination for all respondents and a detailed examination including visual fields, gonioscopy and fundus photography for those who were visually impaired or blind (i.e. presenting vision <20/40 in the better eye). A principal cause of visual loss was assigned to all respondents with presenting vision <20/40 in the better eye.
   Results. A total of 15 122 persons aged >= 40 years were enumerated, 13 599 (89.9%) of whom were examined. The prevalence of blindness varied according to ecological zone, being highest in the Sahel region (6.6%; 95% confidence interval (Cl) 4.2 - 10.4) and lowest in the rain forest region (3.23%; 95% CI 2.6 - 3.9). Age/gender-adjusted analyses showed that risk of blindness was highest in Sahel (odds ratio (OR) 3.4; 95% CI 2.1 - 5.8). More than 80% of blindness in all ecological regions was avoidable. Trachoma was a significant cause only in the Sudan savannah belt. The prevalence of all major blinding conditions was highest in the Sahel.
   Conclusions. The findings of this national survey may be applicable to other countries in West and Central Africa that share similar ecological zones. Onchocerciasis and trachoma are not major causes of blindness in Nigeria, possibly reflecting successful control efforts for both these neglected tropical diseases.

T2  - TROPICAL VETERINARY DISEASES: CONTROL AND PREVENTION IN THE CONTEXT OF THE NEW WORLD ORDER
CP  - 5th Biennial Conference of the Society-for-Tropical-Veterinary-Medicine
AB  - Twenty-three Costa Rican dairy herds from an vesicular stomatitis (VS) endemic area were under an active surveillance between April 1997 and March 1999. Ninety-two confirmed cases of VS New Jersey were found. Factors associated with clinical cases of VS virus New Jersey were: Parity (animals of parity 4 or 5 were 5.3 times more likely to present a clinical case than animals of parity 3 and lower; on the other hand, animals of parity 6 and higher showed an odds 4.6 times greater than animals of parity 3 and lower.) Ecological life zone (animals in premountain moist forest were 7.4 times more likely to present clinical cases than animals in lower mountain rain forest). Factors associated with seropositivity at the time of birth were farm and breed (Jersey calves had an odds 14.7 times greater than Holstein calves). Seroconversion, defined as the first twofold increase in the titers of the blood, was associated with farm and showed four peaks during the study period, September (wet season) 1997, February (dry season) 1998, September 1998, and February 1999. Finally, time to event analysis showed difference between farms and age, older animals showed the first seroconversion earlier than younger animals.

TI  - Distorted-distance models for directional dispersal: a general framework with application to a wind-dispersed tree
T2  - METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB  - 1. Seed and pollen dispersal is often directionally biased, because of the inherent directionality of wind and many other dispersal vectors. Nevertheless, the vast majority of studies of seed and pollen dispersal fit isotropic dispersal kernels to data, implicitly assuming that dispersal is equally likely in all directions. 2. Here, we offer a flexible method for stochastic modelling of directional dispersal data. We show how anisotropic models can be constructed by combining standard dispersal functions with distorted-distance functions that transform the circular contour lines of any isotropic dispersal kernel into non-circular shapes. Many existing anisotropic phenomenological models of seed and pollen dispersal are special cases of our framework. 3. We present functional forms for the specific case of elliptic distorted-distance functions, under which contour lines of the seed shadow become non-concentric, nested ellipses, and show how models using these functions can be constructed and parameterized. R-code is provided. 4. We applied the elliptic anisotropic models to characterize seed dispersal in the wind-dispersed Neotropical tree Luehea seemannii (Malvaceae) on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. We used inverse modelling to fit alternative models to data of seed rain into seed traps, the locations of seed traps and adult trees, and tree size. 5. Our anisotropic model performed considerably better than commonly applied isotropic models, revealing that seed dispersal of L.similar to seemannii was strongly directional. The best-fitting model combined a 3-parameter elliptic distorted-distance function that captured the strong directional biases with a 1-parameter exponential dispersal kernel, a 1-parameter negative binomial probability distribution describing the clumping of seed rain and a 1-parameter function relating tree fecundity to tree diameter. 6. The framework presented in this paper enables more flexible and accurate modelling of directional dispersal data. It is applicable not only to studies of seed dispersal, but also to a wide range of other problems in which large numbers of particles disperse from one or more point sources.

TI  - Spatial pattern of genetic diversity and selection in the MHC class II <i>DRB</i> of three Neotropical bat species
T2  - BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY
AB  - Background: Although bats are natural reservoirs of many pathogens, few studies have been conducted on the genetic variation and detection of selection in major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes. These genes are critical for resistance and susceptibility to diseases, and host-pathogen interactions are major determinants of their extensive polymorphism. Here we examined spatial patterns of diversity of the expressed MHC class II DRB gene of three sympatric Neotropical bats, Carollia perspicillata and Desmodus rotundus (Phyllostomidae), and Molossus molossus (Molossidae), all of which use the same environments (e.g., forests, edge habitats, urban areas). Comparison with neutral marker (mtDNA D-loop) diversity was performed at the same time.
   Results: Twenty-three DRB alleles were identified in 19 C. perspicillata, 30 alleles in 35 D. rotundus and 20 alleles in 28 M. molossus. The occurrence of multiple DRB loci was found for the two Phyllostomidae species. The DRB polymorphism was high in all sampling sites and different signatures of positive selection were detected depending on the environment. The patterns of DRB diversity were similar to those of neutral markers for C. perspicillata and M. molossus. In contrast, these patterns were different for D. rotundus for which a geographical structure was highlighted. A heterozygote advantage was also identified for this species. No recombination or gene conversion event was found and phylogenetic relationships showed a trans-species mode of evolution in the Phyllostomids.
   Conclusions: This study of MHC diversity demonstrated the strength of the environment and contrasting pathogen pressures in shaping DRB diversity. Differences between positively selected sites identified in bat species highlighted the potential role of gut microbiota in shaping immune responses. Furthermore, multiple geographic origins and/or population admixtures observed in C. perspicillata and M. molossus populations acted as an additional force in shaping DRB diversity. In contrast, DRB diversity of D. rotundus was shaped by environment rather than demographic history.

TI  - Environmental Temperature Affects Prevalence of Blood Parasites of Birds on an Elevation Gradient: Implications for Disease in a Warming Climate
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Background: The rising global temperature is predicted to expand the distribution of vector-borne diseases both in latitude and altitude. Many host communities could be affected by increased prevalence of disease, heightening the risk of extinction for many already threatened species. To understand how host communities could be affected by changing parasite distributions, we need information on the distribution of parasites in relation to variables like temperature and rainfall that are predicted to be affected by climate change.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We determined relations between prevalence of blood parasites, temperature, and seasonal rainfall in a bird community of the Australian Wet Tropics along an elevation gradient. We used PCR screening to investigate the prevalence and lineage diversity of four genera of blood parasites (Plasmodium, Haemoproteus, Leucocytozoon and Trypanosoma) in 403 birds. The overall prevalence of the four genera of blood parasites was 32.3%, with Haemoproteus the predominant genus. A total of 48 unique lineages were detected. Independent of elevation, parasite prevalence was positively and strongly associated with annual temperature. Parasite prevalence was elevated during the dry season.
   Conclusions/Significance: Low temperatures of the higher elevations can help to reduce both the development of avian haematozoa and the abundance of parasite vectors, and hence parasite prevalence. In contrast, high temperatures of the lowland areas provide an excellent environment for the development and transmission of haematozoa. We showed that rising temperatures are likely to lead to increased prevalence of parasites in birds, and may force shifts of bird distribution to higher elevations. We found that upland tropical areas are currently a low-disease habitat and their conservation should be given high priority in management plans under climate change.

TI  - Antioxidant Activity of Rhizophora Mucronata Collected from Thoothukudi Coastal Area, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE RESEARCH
AB  - Introduction: Mangrove forests yield the coast lines of several tropical countries. Apart from ecological importance, plants hold important therapeutic uses. One among the mangrove species is Rhizophora mucronata. Antioxidant properties of medicinal plants have attracted the attention of many researchers. The antioxidant compounds terminate the attack of free radicals and reduce the risk of neurological disorders.
   Aim: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the antioxidant potential of Rhizophora mucronata
   Materials and Methods:The fresh leaves of Rhizophora mucronata were collected from Tuticorin coastal area, Tamilnadu. The dried mangrove powdered leaves were used to prepare methanol extract of Rhizophora mucronata. The extract was used to evaluate the total antioxidant activity. Total reducing activity and free radical scavenging activity using DPPH assay and compared with the standard ascorbic acid.
   Results and Discussion : The antioxidant potential of Rhizophora mucronata by DPPH assay showed a maximum scavenging activity of 93.86% at highest concentration (150 mu g/ml)while the standard ascorbic acid showed 98.6% at high concentration.The maximum concentration of 150 mu g/ml of R. mucronata extract was equivalent to 136.85 +/- 1.28 concentration of ascorbic acid in total antioxidant activity and the maximum concentration of 150 mu g/ml of R. mucronata extract was equivalent to 73.24 +/- 1.22 concentration of ascorbic acid in total reducing power.
   BThe present study concludes that Rhizophora mucronata has very good antioxidant activity. Hence, the extract can be used for its antioxidant property in disease conditions such as heart diseases, diabetes and certain cancers after further invivo studies.

TI  - Malaria in Brazil, Colombia, Peru and Venezuela: current challenges in malaria control and elimination
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
AB  - In spite of significant progress towards malaria control and elimination achieved in South America in the 2000s, this mosquito-transmitted tropical disease remains an important public health concern in the region. Most malaria cases in South America come from Amazon rain forest areas in northern countries, where more than half of malaria is caused by Plasmodium vivax, while Plasmodium falciparum malaria incidence has decreased in recent years. This review discusses current malaria data, policies and challenges in four South American Amazon countries: Brazil, Colombia, Peru and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. Challenges to continuing efforts to further decrease malaria incidence in this region include: a significant increase in malaria cases in recent years in Venezuela, evidence of submicroscopic and asymptomatic infections, peri-urban malaria, gold mining-related malaria, malaria in pregnancy, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency and primaquine use, and possible under-detection of Plasmodium malariae. Some of these challenges underscore the need to implement appropriate tools and procedures in specific regions, such as a field-compatible molecular malaria test, a P. malariae-specific test, malaria diagnosis and appropriate treatment as part of regular antenatal care visits, G6PD test before primaquine administration for P. vivax cases (with weekly primaquine regimen for G6PD deficient individuals), single low dose of primaquine for P. falciparum malaria in Colombia, and national and regional efforts to contain malaria spread in Venezuela urgently needed especially in mining areas. Joint efforts and commitment towards malaria control and elimination should be strategized based on examples of successful regional malaria fighting initiatives, such as PAMAFRO and RAVREDA/AMI.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Distribution of <i>Aedes aegypti</i> (Diptera: Culicidae) Mitochondrial Lineages in Cities with Distinct Dengue Incidence Rates Suggests Complex Population Dynamics of the Dengue Vector in Colombia
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   Aedes aegypti is the primary vector of the four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV1-4), Chikungunya and yellow fever virus to humans. Previous population genetic studies have revealed a particular genetic structure among the vector populations in the Americas that suggests differences in the ability to transmit DENV. In Colombia, despite its high epidemiologic importance, the genetic population structure and the phylogeographic depiction of Ae. aegypti, as well as its relationship with the epidemiologic landscapes in cities with heterogeneous incidence levels, remains unknown. We conducted a spatiotemporal analysis with the aim of determining the genetic structure and phylogeography of Colombian populations of Ae. aegypti among cities with different eco-epidemiologic characteristics with regard to DENV.
   Methods/Findings
   Mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase C subunit 1 (COI) - NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4 (ND4) genes were sequenced and analyzed from 341 adult mosquitoes collected during 2012 and 2013 in the Colombian cities of Bello, Riohacha and Villavicencio, which exhibit low, medium and high levels of incidence of DENV, respectively. The results demonstrated a low genetic differentiation over time and a high genetic structure between the cities due to changes in the frequency of two highly supported genetic groups. The phylogeographic analyses indicated that one group (associated with West African populations) was found in all the cities throughout the sampling while the second group (associated with East African populations) was found in all the samples from Bello and in only one sampling from Riohacha. Environmental factors such as the use of chemical insecticides showed a significant correlation with decreasing genetic diversity, indicating that environmental factors affect the population structure of Ae. aegypti across time and space in these cities.
   Conclusions
   Our results suggest that two Ae. aegypti lineages are present in Colombia; one that is widespread and related to a West African conspecific, and a second that may have been recently introduced and is related to an East African conspecific. The first lineage can be found in cities showing a high incidence of dengue fever and the use of chemical insecticides, whereas the second is present in cities showing a low incidence of dengue fever where the use of chemical insecticides is not constant. This study helps to improve our knowledge of the population structure of Ae. aegypti involved in the diversity of dengue fever epidemiology in Colombia.

TI  - The value of improved pastures to Brazilian beef production
T2  - CROP & PASTURE SCIENCE
AB  - Brazil is an agricultural country, with 190 Mha of pastures sustaining 209 million cattle. Fewer than 10% of the cattle are fattened in feedlots, whereas cattle reared on pastures have a competitive advantage for export, eliminating the risks presented by the mad cow disease (bovine spongiform encephalopathy) and considerations related to animal welfare. Brazil has been the world's largest exporter of beef since 2004 and has the largest commercial herd in the world. In 2011, 16.5% of its production was exported, and the livestock sector contributed 30.4% of the gross national product from agribusiness and 6.73% of the total GNP. Many forage breeding programs, mainly at Embrapa, have contributed to the development of improved pastures, and cultivars of Brachiaria brizantha, B. decumbens, B. humidicola and Panicum maximum are the main pastures used in the country. All have apomictic reproduction, which means there are few cultivars occupying very large, continuous areas, thus suggesting a risk to the productive system. Such is the case of B. brizantha cv. Marandu, which occupies around 50 Mha. The Brazilian tropical forage seed industry is also important, and Brazil is the main seed exporter, supplying all Latin American countries. Due to pasture degradation, around 8 Mha is renovated or recovered each year. Forages are also used and planted each year in integrated crop-livestock and integrated crop-livestock-forest systems. Nowadays, these systems occupy 4 Mha. Improved pastures are thus a major asset in Brazil not only for the beef production chain but also for the dairy industry.

TI  - Green synthesizes and characterization of copper-oxide nanoparticles by<i> Thespesia</i><i> populnea</i> against skin-infection causing microbes
T2  - JOURNAL OF KING SAUD UNIVERSITY SCIENCE
AB  - Researchers are now focusing on nanotechnology using metal oxide nanoparticles that have a wide range of antimicrobial activity to treat diseases. Thespesia populnea tree belongs to the Malvaceae family grown in tropical areas often found in the mangrove forest. The present study reported Thespesia populnea aqueous bark extract combines with copper metals effectively against skin-infection causing microbes. Qualitative analysis of both aqueous and methanol extract showed the presence of phytochemicals constituents and further conformational by histochemical screening. Quantitative analysis of polyphenol, terpenoids, and triterpenoids was calculated. The synthesized nanoparticles are characterized by several techniques such as UV-Vis spectroscopy, SEM, particle size distribution, EDX, FTIR, and Zeta potential. UV-Vis spectra analysis of the reaction mixture showed the maximum peak was observed at 400 nm. Scanning electron microscopic (SEM) showed the higher density poly-dispersed spherical shaped nanoparticles around 61 to 69 nm in size. Average particle size distribution of the CuONPs is ranged from 60 to 80 nm. Antimicrobial activity of CuONPs is more effective against skin infection-causing microbes of bacterial strains such as (Staphylococcus aureus (MTCC 102), Streptococcus pyogenes (MTCC 102), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MTCC 358), and fungal strains such as Trichophyton rubrum (MTCC 296), Candida albicans (MTCC 183). The fungal strain of Trichophyton rubrum (MTCC 296) showed a high zone of inhibition compared with other microbial strains.(c) 2022 The Authors.

TI  - Determining Philippine coconut maturity level using machine learning algorithms based on acoustic signal
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
AB  - Advanced intelligent systems are becoming significant to many sectors, including farming. In agriculture, the intelligent classification of post-harvested fruits seems to have a direct impact on farmers, mainly for export products. Unlike other popular fruits, coconuts tend to have limited studies due to its tropical nature grown in developing countries as well as its unique physical structure. In this study, a classification of real coconut datasets is performed based on acoustic signals acquired through a developed tapping system and learned by three widely-used machine learning techniques - artificial neural network (ANN), random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM). There are 129 coconuts samples, each classified into three maturity levels - pre-mature, mature, and over-mature. A three-second tapping system gathered from each sample a total of 132,300 data points, which underwent noise reduction and signal processing. Each machine learning model predicts the class of the fruit by learning the patterns of the transformed frequency spectrums of each sample signal. Based on ten times cross-validated results, the three machine learning algorithms satisfactorily predicted the maturity level of coconuts with at least 80% classification accuracy. All models correctly predicted over-mature coconuts but confused in classifying pre-mature with mature and mature with over-mature coconuts. RF model outperformed the other models with efficiencies of 90.98% and 83.48% accuracies for training and testing, respectively. The imbalance data for each coconut class can be addressed to give better results. Additionally, the prepared coconut dataset may use more advanced deep learning techniques.

TI  - Molecular evidence, risk factors analysis, and hematological alterations associated with<i> Theileria</i> spp. spillover in captive wild mouflon sheep in Punjab, Pakistan
T2  - IRANIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Landscape anthropization and interaction between domestic and wild animals are the major contributing factors involved in the emergence of new pathogens in wild animals. Theileriosis is an emerging issue of wild ungulates, especially in the tropical and subtropical areas of the globe. Aims: The current study investigated the mouflon sheep for Theileria infection using molecular methods and hematological analysis. Methods: This study was conducted on a total of 103 captive wild mouflon sheep present in eight different recreational zoos, and wildlife parks in Punjab, Pakistan to investigate the genotypic prevalence of Theileria spp. by targeting 18S rRNA and molecular evidence for Theileria spillover between domestic and wild mouflon sheep by phylogenetic analysis. The association of assumed risk factors and the effect of Theileria spp. on various hematological parameters were also assessed. Results: The results depicted that Theileria spp. was prevalent in 8 (7.77%, CI 95%: 3.99-14.59%), and 11 (10.68%, CI 95%: 06.07-18.12%) animals based on microscopy, and PCR, respectively. The phylogenetic analysis of the 18S rRNA gene of Theileria spp. from mouflon revealed a close resemblance with T. annulata from domestic animals. The risk factor analysis revealed that tick infestation, enclosure hygiene, previous tick infestation history, and the presence of wooden logs in the enclosure were significantly (P<0.05) associated with the occurrence of Theileria spp. infection in the captive mouflon sheep of Pakistan. Furthermore, a significant reduction in blood parameters like PCV, RBCs count, Hb, and platelets was observed in Theileria-positive animals. Conclusion: This study is the first evidence at the molecular level to characterize the spillover of Theileria spp. between the captive wild mouflon sheep and domestic animals of Pakistan, and it will be useful in developing control strategies for emerging theileriosis in captive wild animals.

TI  - EnvDB, a database for describing the environmental distribution of prokaryotic taxa
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY REPORTS
AB  - EnvDB is a database that classifies the environmental samples and their associated 16S rDNA sequences currently stored in GenBank. The samples were categorized in a three-level, hierarchical classification of media: the five upper levels (terrestrial, aquatic, thermal, host-associated and other) are further decomposed in 20 intermediate (such as marine, marine sediments, freshwater, soil, gut, etc.) and 47 lower levels (for instance, soil is further decomposed in forest, agricultural, wetlands, grasslands, tropical, arid, etc.). Each sample was also characterized with nine environmental features: polluted, diseased (for clinical samples), acidic, alkaline, hot environment, cold environment, saline, anoxic and restricted (when the study is focused only in particular taxonomic groups). The classification of samples was aided by text-mining techniques, complemented with careful curation and completion by human experts. EnvDB currently includes 359 928 sequences from 3502 samples. The sequences were clustered at several identity levels to obtain operative taxonomic units (OTUs). Sequences and OTUs have been taxonomically assigned to the maximum possible resolution by different procedures. The user can obtain information about sequences, OTUs, samples and environments, combining these tables using a flexible querying system that allows generating very diverse queries. Thus, the user can easily inspect the presence and abundance of particular taxa in particular samples and environments. The database also allows the users to run analyses with their own data: users can input their sequences and find the closest sequences or samples in the database. EnvDB can be accessed in the web address http://metagenomics.uv.es/envDB.

TI  - Transmission of viruses associated with cytoplasmic and nuclear leprosis symptoms by <i>Brevipalpus yothersi</i> and <i>B-californicus</i>
T2  - TROPICAL PLANT PATHOLOGY
AB  - Two groups of viruses cause the citrus disease complex known as leprosis: the cytoplasmic type, of the genera Cilevirus and Higrevirus, and the nuclear type, of the genus Dichorhavirus. It has been shown that the cilevirus Citrus leprosis virus C (CiLV-C) is transmitted by Brevipalpus yothersi. Within the genus Dichorhavirus, CiLV-N is a recently described and distinct species present in Brazil and transmitted by B. phoenicis sensu stricto, whereas the species found in Mexico and Colombia are strains of Orchid fleck virus (OFV-citrus), suspected to be vectored by B. californicus. A study was conducted to determine whether B. californicus and B. yothersi can acquire and inoculate Mexican isolates of CiLV-C and OFV-citrus to sweet and acid citrus species (sweet orange, mandarin, grapefruit, sour orange, Persian lime and Mexican lime) in experiments set up in areas in Mexico with prevalence of the respective viruses. Brevipalpus californicus acquired OFV-citrus and transmitted it to all the citrus cultivars included in the experiment, while B. yothersi acquired CiLV-C and transmitted it only to sweet citrus cultivars (sweet orange, mandarin, and grapefruit). Both mite species were able to become established and reproduce in the experimental plants for nearly a year. This study represents the first experimental evidence of OFV-citrus transmission by B. californicus, as well as evidence that B. yothersi cannot transmit this virus.

TI  - Influence of Agulhas forcing of Holocene climate change in South Africa's southern Cape
T2  - QUATERNARY RESEARCH
AB  - This paper analyses a series of high-quality continuous records from southeastern Africa to study the spatiotemporal patterning of Holocene hydroclimatic anomalies in the region. Results indicate dominant frequencies of variability at millennial time scales, and a series of anomalies broadly common to all records. Of particular interest, data from the southern Cape coast exhibit periods of wetter/drier conditions that are out of phase with the sites less than 150 km away in the adjacent interior, but in phase with sites in tropical regions over 1000 km to the northeast. To explain such spatial patterns and gradients, we propose that the Agulhas Current may be a critical vector by which tropical climatic signals are propagated along the littoral zone, exerting a dominant, highly localized influence on near-coastal environmental conditions. Limitations in the data available do not allow for a detailed examination of the climatic dynamics related to these phenomena, but this paper highlights a series of avenues for future research to clarify the spatial extent and stability of the patterns observed.

TI  - Tegumentary leishmaniasis in the State of Amazonas: what have we learned and what do we need?
T2  - REVISTA DA SOCIEDADE BRASILEIRA DE MEDICINA TROPICAL
AB  - This study evaluated the occurrence of American tegumentary leishmaniasis (ATL) in the State of Amazonas, Brazil, in the last 30 years with emphasis on the last 10 years (2001 to 2010). The disease was predominantly observed in males (76.2%), in the 21- to 30-year-old age group (26.6%) and in extractive workers (43.7%); 3.3% of the cases were the mucosal form. The endemic channel shows the disease seasonality, with a predominance of cases at the beginning and end of each year. The number of cases by municipality in the period of 2001-2010 shows the maintenance of the endemic in the localities where the highest numbers of cases have always been registered, namely, Manaus, Rio Preto da Eva, Itacoatiara and Presidente Figueiredo. The comparison of data from 2001 to 2005 and from 2006 to 2010 showed the emergence of this disease in municipalities that had been previously unaffected. In the last years, there has been a significant increase in the activities of control, diagnosis and treatment of leishmaniasis in the State of Amazonas. In conclusion, the historical series of ATL analyzed in this study suggests that the transmission foci remain and are even expanding, though without continuous transmission in the intra-or peridomicile settings. Moreover, the disease will persist in the Amazon while the factors associated with infection acquisition relative to forest exploitation continue to have economic appeal. There is a real expectation of wide variations in disease incidence that can be influenced by climate and economic aspects.

TI  - Distribution and larval habitat characterization of <i>Anopheles moucheti</i>, <i>Anopheles nili</i>, and other malaria vectors in river networks of southern Cameroon
T2  - ACTA TROPICA
AB  - Despite their importance as malaria vectors, little is known of the bionomic of Anopheles nili and Anopheles moucheti. Larval collections from 24 sites situated along the dense hydrographic network of south Cameroon were examined to assess key ecological factors associated with these mosquitoes distribution in river networks. Morphological identification of the III and IV instar larvae by the use of microscopy revealed that 47.6% of the larvae belong to An. nili and 22.6% to An. moucheti. Five variables were significantly involved with species distribution, the pace of flow of the river (lotic, or lentic), the light exposure (sunny or shady), vegetation (presence or absence of vegetation) the temperature and the presence or absence of debris. Using canonical correspondence analysis. it appeared that lotic rivers. exposed to light, with vegetation or debris were the best predictors of An. nili larval abundance. Whereas, An. moucheti and An. ovengensis were highly associated with lentic rivers, low temperature, having Pistia. An. nili and An. moucheti distribution along river systems across south Cameroon was highly correlated with environmental variables. The distribution of An. nili conforms to that of a generalist species which is adapted to exploiting a variety of environmental conditions, Whereas, An. moucheti, Anopheles ovengensis and Anopheles carnevalei appeared as specialist forest mosquitoes.

TI  - Invasive <i>Salmonella</i> Infections at Multiple Surveillance Sites in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 2011-2014
T2  - CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB  - Background. This study reports the microbiological landscape of Salmonella Typhi and invasive nontyphoidal Salmonella (iNTS) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
   Methods. Blood cultures obtained from hospital-admitted patients suspected of bloodstream infection (BSI) in 4 of 11 provinces in DRC (Kinshasa, Bas-Congo, Equateur, and Orientale) were processed. Sampling had started in 2007; the results for the period 2011-2014 are reported.
   Results. Salmonella Typhi and iNTS were cultured from 194 (1.4%) and 840 (5.9%), respectively, of 14 110 BSI episodes and ranked first among BSI pathogens in adults (65/300 [21.7%]) and children (783/1901 [41.2%]), respectively. A total of 948 of 1034 (91.7%) isolates were available for analysis (164 Salmonella Typhi and 784 iNTS). Salmonella Typhimurium and Salmonella Enteritidis represented 386 (49.2%) and 391 (49.9%), respectively, of iNTS isolates, fluctuating over time and geography and increasing during the rainy season. Adults accounted for <5% of iNTS BSI episodes. Children <5 years accounted for 20.3% of Salmonella Typhi BSI episodes. Among Salmonella Typhi, rates of multidrug resistance and decreased ciprofloxacin susceptibility (DCS) were 37.8% and 37.2%, respectively, and 18.3% displayed combined multidrug resistance and DCS; rates of azithromycin and ceftriaxone resistance were 0.6% and absent, respectively. Among NTS isolates, >= 80% (79.7% of Salmonella Enteritidis and 90.2% of Salmonella Typhimurium isolates) showed multidrug resistance, and <2.5% showed DCS. Combined extended-spectrum beta-lactamase production (bla(TEM-1) gene) and azithromycin resistance was noted in 12.7% of Salmonella Typhimurium isolates, appearing in Bas-Congo from 2013 onward.
   Conclusions. Salmonella Typhi and NTS are major causes of BSI in DRC; their antimicrobial resistance is increasing.

TI  - Transcriptome and metabolome profiling in different stages of infestation of <i>Eucalyptus urophylla</i> clones by <i>Ralstonia solanacearum</i>
T2  - MOLECULAR GENETICS AND GENOMICS
AB  - Eucalyptus urophylla is an economically important tree species that widely planted in tropical and sub-tropical areas around the world, which suffers significant losses due to Ralstonia solanacearum. However, little is known about the molecular mechanism of pathogen-response of Eucalyptus. We collected the vascular tissues of a E. urophylla clone infected by R. solanacearum in the laboratory, and combined transcriptome and metabolome analysis to investigate the defense responses of Eucalyptus. A total of 11 flavonoids that differentially accumulated at the first stage or a later stage after infection. The phenylpropanoid of p-coumaraldehyde, the two alkaloids trigonelline and dl-ephedrine, two types of traditional Chinese medicine with patchouli alcohol and 3-dihydrocadambine, and the amino acid phenylalanine were differentially accumulated after infection, which could be biomarkers indicating a response to R. solanacearum. Differentially expressed genes involved in plant hormone signal transduction, phenylpropanoids, flavonoids, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, and amino acid metabolism were activated at the first stage of infection or a later stage, indicating that they may participate in the defense against infection. This study is expected to deliver several insights into the molecular mechanism in response to pathogens in E. urophylla, and the findings have far-reaching implications in the control of E. urophylla pathogens.

TI  - Diversity of extracellular proteins during the transition from the 'proto-apicomplexan' alveolates to the apicomplexan obligate parasites
T2  - PARASITOLOGY
AB  - The recent completion of high-coverage draft genome sequences for several alveolate protozoans - namely, the chromerids, Chromera velia and Vitrella brassicaformis; the perkinsid Perkinsus marinus; the apicomplexan, Gregarina niphandrodes, as well as high coverage transcriptome sequence information for several colpodellids, allows for new genome-scale comparisons across a rich landscape of apicomplexans and other alveolates. Genome annotations can now be used to help interpret fine ultrastructure and cell biology, and guide new studies to describe a variety of alveolate life strategies, such as symbiosis or free living, predation, and obligate intracellular parasitism, as well to provide foundations to dissect the evolutionary transitions between these niches. This review focuses on the attempt to identify extracellular proteins which might mediate the physical interface of cell-cell interactions within the above life strategies, aided by annotation of the repertoires of predicted surface and secreted proteins encoded within alveolate genomes. In particular, we discuss what descriptions of the predicted extracellular proteomes reveal regarding a hypothetical last common ancestor of a pre-apicomplexan alveolate - guided by ultrastructure, life strategies and phylogenetic relationships - in an attempt to understand the evolution of obligate parasitism in apicomplexans.

TI  - Translocation of Fungicides and Their Efficacy in Controlling <i>Phellinus noxius</i>, the Cause of Brown Root Rot Disease
T2  - PLANT DISEASE
AB  - Brown root rot disease (BRRD), caused by Phellinus noxius, is an important tree disease in tropical and subtropical areas. To improve chemical control of BRRD and deter emergence of fungicide resistance in P. noxius, this study investigated control efficacies and systemic activities of fungicides with different modes of action. Fourteen fungicides with 11 different modes of action were tested for inhibitory effects in vitro on 39 P. noxius isolates from Taiwan, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Australia, and Pacific Islands. Cyproconazole, epoxiconazole, and tebuconazole (Fungicide Resistance Action Committee [FRAC] 3, target-site G1) inhibited colony growth of P. noxius by 99.9 to 100% at 10 ppm and 97.7 to 99.8% at 1 ppm. The other effective fungicide was cyprodinil + fludioxonil (FRAC 9 + 12, target-site D1 + E2), which showed growth inhibition of 96.9% at 10 ppm and 88.6% at 1 ppm. Acropetal translocation of six selected fungicides was evaluated in bishop wood (Bischofia javanica) seedlings by immersion of the root tips in each fungicide at 100 ppm, followed by liquid or gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry analyses of consecutive segments of root, stem, and leaf tissues at 7 and 21 days posttreatment. Bidirectional translocation of the fungicides was also evaluated by stem injection of fungicide stock solutions. Cyproconazole and tebuconazole were the most readily absorbed by roots and efficiently transported acropetally. Greenhouse experiments suggested that cyproconazole, tebuconazole, and epoxiconazole have a slightly higher potential for controlling BRRD than mepronil, prochloraz, and cyprodinil + fludioxonil. Because all tested fungicides lacked basipetal translocation, soil drenching should be considered instead of trunk injection for their use in BRRD control.

TI  - Prevalence of caprine brucellosis on herds of toba communities in Villa Rio Bermejito, Chaco, Argentina (October 2010)
T2  - TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES
CP  - International Congress on Tropical Veterinary Medicine / 2nd Joint AITVM-STVM Meeting - Animal Health in the Tropics - Building the Puzzle from Research to Application
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of caprine brucellosis in goat herds in a region known as 'The Impenetrable' in Chaco Province, Argentina, in order to prevent the occurrence of the disease in people consuming goats' milk. There are high levels of child malnutrition and difficulties in accessing high-quality protein in this region; therefore, goats' milk is a valuable nutrition source. We travelled with Patricia Sosa's foundation 'Little gestures, big results' to Villa Rio Bermejito, Chaco, in October 2010 with the laboratory equipment needed to carry out field tests. The foundation is staffed by voluntary workers, including doctors, dentists, experts in social issues, psychologists, who encourage the community to consume goats' milk in their meals after cooking or pasteurizing it to avoid contamination. Blood samples were taken from 273 goats distributed in 13 herds established in the depth of Chaco dry forest that had not been vaccinated against brucellosis. Samples were analysed using the buffered plate antigen test, and positive results were confirmed using the slow agglutination test. Animals were identified using small plastic ear tags. We found only one positive case, with a titre of 1/50. This was considered suspicious and the owner was advised to take the animal out of the herd. Our results indicate that the isolation of these herds in the depths of the forest has protected them from brucellosis, and therefore, they are a good source of high-quality protein, which the people of this region need.

TI  - A systematic review of the microbial community in taiassuids: a One Health approach
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Collared and white-lipped peccaries are sympatric and are distributed in most of South America and in the humid tropical forests of Mexico and Central America. Historically, these species have been used as a source of protein by traditional and/or indigenous human communities, but currently they have been used for legal consumption in different countries. Thus, there has been greater interaction between these wild species and domestic animals and humans, enabling microbial interactions between different niches. The present study presents a systematic review of the literature on the microbial community of collared peccaries and white-lipped peccaries distributed throughout the world, focusing on experimental studies related to the detection of microorganisms as well as the prevalence of the animal species and its characterization of the studied population, in situ or ex situ. Seventy-two studies were selected, mainly in South American countries, related to different species of microorganisms isolated or serologically detected (viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites), either as microbiota, pathogens or commensals, many of which are of zoonotic interest, such as Leptospira, Toxoplasma, Brucella, among others. Therefore, these wild mammals are characterized as sentinel agents of anthropic action and require the implementation of studies in relation to their contribution to the spread of microorganisms, being a potential source of amplification and transmission of pathogens.

TI  - ECOLOGICAL MEDIATORS FOR THE GREGARIOUS BEHAVIOUR OF <i>ACHATINA FULICA</i> (MOLLUSCA; ACHATINIDAE)
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONCHOLOGY
AB  - The Giant African Land snail, Achatina fulica Bowdich 1822, which is regarded as one of the 100 worst invasive species in the world, has evolved on the edges of tropical forests, where it has developed its general characteristics showing an ability to adapt to a variety of environments. The objective of this study has been to evaluate the ecological mediators of aggregation, both among wild and captive animals. The sample consisted of 3623 specimens that had shown a preference for isolation illustrating the fact that aggregation is not a set pattern for this species, but rather, a strategy that varies, depending on the site, the season, maturity of the animal and the substrate. This suggests that there is a link between aggregation and factors such as protection, reproduction and overpopulation. Homing and aggregation with the same co-specifics were found to be common since both the co-specifics and the substrate can be employed as a means of orientation through the environment and are a way of locating the areas used for feeding, reproduction and shelter. The data from this study provides evidence that the gregarious behaviour of A. fulica is a complex mechanism mediated by a wide range of ecological factors. The behaviour is a strategy used for its protection and adaptation to different substrates and environmental conditions and can thus maximize its invasive potential.

TI  - Morphometric characteristics and seasonal proximity to water of the Cypriot blunt-nosed viper <i>Macrovipera lebetina lebetina</i> (Linnaeus, 1758)
T2  - JOURNAL OF VENOMOUS ANIMALS AND TOXINS INCLUDING TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - BackgroundThe blunt-nosed viper Macrovipera lebetina (Linnaeus, 1758) is a medically important snake species in the Middle East. Its nominate subspecies Macrovipera l. lebetina is confined to Cyprus, where it is the only dangerously venomous snake species and heavily pursued. Despite the viper's large size, data on its body mass and sex-specific morphological differences are scarce. It is commonly believed that M. l. lebetina prefers freshwater proximity during summer. Hence, we aimed at investigating M. l. lebetina sex-specific morphological differences and its possible attraction to freshwater bodies in late summer.MethodsMorphometric characteristics, proximity to water and conservation status of M. l. lebetina were investigated in Paphos district (Cyprus) in 2014, 2015 and 2017. Vipers were caught in different habitats, examined morphologically for metric and meristic characters, and released back into their habitat. Additionally, local people were interviewed about the conservation situation of the species.ResultsOf 38 recorded blunt-nosed vipers, morphological characteristics were collected from 34 (10 adult males, 16 adult females, eight unsexed juveniles). Rounded total length (ToL) ranged from 23.5cm to 133.0cm and weight between 10g and 1456g. Adult males significantly exceeded adult females in tail length (TaL), ToL and head length (HL). No significant sex-specific differences were found in snout-vent length (SVL), head width (HW), weight or body condition index (BCI), nor for the ratios TaL / SVL, TaL / ToL, HL / SVL or HL / HW. Adult females from late summer (2015) had a significantly lower mean BCI than those from spring (2014).Distances of blunt-nosed vipers to the nearest water bodies (natural and artificial, respectively) did not differ significantly between spring (2014) and late summer (2015). There was also no significant difference between the distances of vipers to natural and to artificial water bodies in spring (and late summer).ConclusionsAdult male blunt-nosed vipers exceed adult females in TaL, ToL and HL. Adult females are likely in a more vulnerable body condition in late summer than in spring. Periodic drying out of freshwater bodies in summer probably does not affect the species' occurrence. Educational workshops and habitat conservation are recommended for reducing human-viper conflict.

TI  - A Global Comparison of the Human and <i>T</i>. <i>brucei</i> Degradomes Gives Insights about Possible Parasite Drug Targets
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - We performed a genome-level computational study of sequence and structure similarity, the latter using crystal structures and models, of the proteases of Homo sapiens and the human parasite Trypanosoma brucei. Using sequence and structure similarity networks to summarize the results, we constructed global views that show visually the relative abundance and variety of proteases in the degradome landscapes of these two species, and provide insights into evolutionary relationships between proteases. The results also indicate how broadly these sequence sets are covered by three-dimensional structures. These views facilitate cross-species comparisons and offer clues for drug design from knowledge about the sequences and structures of potential drug targets and their homologs. Two protease groups ("M32" and "C51") that are very different in sequence from human proteases are examined in structural detail, illustrating the application of this global approach in mining new pathogen genomes for potential drug targets. Based on our analyses, a human ACE2 inhibitor was selected for experimental testing on one of these parasite proteases, TbM32, and was shown to inhibit it. These sequence and structure data, along with interactive versions of the protein similarity networks generated in this study, are available at http://babbittlab.ucsf.edu/resources.html.

TI  - Studies on the sand fly fauna (Diptera: Psychodidae) in high-transmission areas of cutaneous leishmaniasis in the Republic of Suriname
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
AB  - Background: Sand flies (Diptera: Psychodidae) are the vectors of Leishmania parasites, the causative agents of leishmaniasis. Cutaneous leishmaniasis is an increasing public health problem in the Republic of Suriname and is mainly caused by Leishmania (Vianna) guyanensis, but L. (V.) braziliensis, L. (L.) amazonensis, and L. (V.) naiffi also infect humans. Transmission occurs predominantly in the forested hinterland of the country. Information regarding the potential vectors of leishmaniasis in Suriname is limited. This study aims to broaden the knowledge about vectors involved in the transmission of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Suriname. For this purpose, sand flies were characterized in various foci of cutaneous leishmaniasis in the country, the districts of Para, Brokopondo, and Sipaliwini.
   Methods: Sand flies were collected in areas around mining plots and villages using CDC light traps in the period between February 2011 and March 2013. They were categorized by examination of the spermathecea (females) and the external genitalia (males).
   Results: A total of 2,743 sand fly specimens belonging to 34 different species were captured, including four species (Lutzomyia aragaoi, Lu. ayrozai, Lu. damascenoi, and Lu. sordellii) that had never before been described for Suriname. Five percent of the catch comprised Lu. squamiventris sensu lato, one female of which was positive with L. (V.) braziliensis and was captured in a gold mining area in Brokopondo. Other sand fly species found positive for Leishmania parasites were Lu. trichopyga, Lu. ininii, and Lu. umbratilis, comprising 32, 8, and 4%, respectively, of the catch. These were captured at gold mining areas in Brokopondo and Sipaliwini, but the Leishmania parasites they had ingested could not be identified due to insufficient amounts of DNA.
   Conclusions: The sand fly fauna in Suriname is highly diverse and comprises Lutzomyia species capable of transmitting Leishmania parasites. Four new Lutzomyia species have been found, and four species -Lu. squamiventris (s.l.), Lu. trichopyga, Lu. ininii, and Lu. umbratilis - have been found to harbor Leishmania parasites. The latter were among the most abundant species captured. These observations may contribute to the understanding of leishmaniasis transmission and the development of control programs in Suriname.

TI  - Predicting carcass tissue composition in Blackbelly sheep using ultrasound measurements and machine learning methods
T2  - TROPICAL ANIMAL HEALTH AND PRODUCTION
AB  - This study aimed to predict Blackbelly sheep carcass tissue composition using ultrasound measurements and machine learning models. The models evaluated were decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and multi-layer perceptrons and were used to predict the total carcass bone (TCB), total carcass fat (TCF), and total carcass muscle (TCM). The best model for predicting the three parameters, TCB, TCF, and TCM was random forests, with mean squared error (MSE) of 0.31, 0.33, and 0.53; mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.26, 0.29, and 0.53; and the coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.67, 0.69, and 0.76, respectively. The results showed that machine learning methods from in vivo ultrasound measurements can be used as determinants of carcass tissue composition, resulting in reliable results.

TI  - Malaria prevalence, knowledge, perception, preventive and treatment behavior among military in Champasak and Attapeu provinces, Lao PDR: a mixed methods study
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HEALTH
AB  - Background: Malaria is a major health problem in Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) with high transmission in remote and forest areas, particularly in the South. The military is at risk of malaria infection especially those deployed in forest areas. This study determined the prevalence of malaria infection and assessed knowledge, perception, and preventive and treatment behavior regarding malaria among military personnel in two southern provinces in Lao PDR.
   Methods: Quantitative and qualitative approaches were undertaken in Champasak and Attapeu provinces in 2017. From 313 military personnel, quantitative data were collected through questionnaire-based interviews and blood samples used for parasite detection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Qualitative data were collected through 7 focus group discussions and 17 in-depth interviews among 49 military personnel. Fisher's exact test and Mann-Whitney U test were used to assess the association between malaria infection and participant characteristics. Content analysis for qualitative data was performed to explore perception and treatment behaviors regarding malaria.
   Results: The prevalence of malaria infection was 11.2% (Plasmodium falciparum: 1.3%, Plasmodium vivax: 9.3% and mixed infections: 0.6%). Many participants understood that malaria is transmitted through mosquito bites, although they did not necessarily know the name of vector mosquitoes (Anopheles). Surprisingly, more than a half also believed that malaria is transmitted through drinking stream water. One-third of the participants used long-lasting insecticidal nets. Due to limited supply, participants were often unable to use mosquito repellent and coils when necessary. Because participants were unable to receive timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment for malaria in their camps, they commonly practiced self-treatment using antibiotics, painkillers, and/or traditional medicines. They only go to a healthcare facility through their supervisor if their conditions worsen.
   Conclusions: The prevalence of symptomatic and asymptomatic malaria was conspicuous among military in forest areas. Many participants believed that malaria is transmitted not only by mosquito bites but also from drinking stream water. Preventive equipment was often insufficient. Self-treatment was practiced before referring to healthcare facility. To further prevent military from contracting malaria, the National Malaria Control Program and military body should provide adequate and suitable health education, protective equipment, and on-site malaria case management.

TI  - <i>Holarrhena pubescens</i> Wall. ex G. Don Extracts Inhibit LPS-Irritated Oxidative Stress in Dendritic Cells
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB  - Holarrhena pubescens Wall. ex G. Don (H. pubescens), belonging to the Apocynaceae family, is distributed in deciduous forests of the tropical Himalayas. H. pubescens is an important traditional medicinal plant, especially its seeds and barks. Therefore, we assessed the antioxidant capacity of H. pubescens extracts in Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced dendritic cells (DCs) for sepsis treatment. Our results indicated that H. pubescens extracts with different doses (25 mu g/mL, 50 mu g/mL, 100 mu g/mL) reduced the reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, and weakened the nitric oxide synthases (NOS) activity and nitric oxide (NO) level in LPS (100 ng/mL)-irritated DCs. In addition, H. pubescens extracts decreased the oxidized glutathione (GSSG) production but increased the reduced glutathione (GSH) production, thereby preserving the cellular reductive status owing to the raised GSH/GSSG ratio. Furthermore, H. pubescens extracts strengthened the antioxidant enzymes activity in LPS-induced DCs, such as glutathione peroxidase (GPx), catalase (CAT), and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Finally, we found that H. pubescens extracts significantly improved the expression of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and the heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) in LPS-irritated DCs. These results indicated that H. pubescens extracts suppressed the LPS-irritated oxidative stress in DCs via Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway, providing a potential strategy for sepsis therapy.

TI  - PROFILE OF PATIENTS WITH BAGGIO-YOSHINARI SYNDROME ADMITTED AT "INSTITUTO DE INFECTOLOGIA EMILIO RIBAS"
T2  - REVISTA DO INSTITUTO DE MEDICINA TROPICAL DE SAO PAULO
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the epidemiological, clinical and laboratorial profile of patients with Baggio-Yoshinari Syndrome (BYS), who underwent internment at the Instituto de Infectologia Emilio Ribas in Sao Paulo, Brazil, during the period from July 1990 to July 2006. BYS is a new Brazilian tick-borne disease caused by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato microorganisms that resembles features of Lyme disease (LD), except for its epidemiological, clinical and laboratorial particularities. From 60 patients' records with positive serology to B. burgdorferi done by ELISA and Western-blotting methods, 19 cases were diagnosed as having BYS, according to criteria adopted at LIM-17 HCFMUSP, the Brazilian Reference Laboratory for the research of BYS. The other 41 remaining patients displayed miscellaneous infections or auto-immune processes. The beginning of symptoms in BYS group varied from one day to six years, from the onset of the disease. Four of 19 patients were included in acute disease stage, and 15 in latent. General unspecific symptoms were identified in almost all cases, with high frequencies of fever (78.9%) and lymphadenomegaly (36.8%). Six patients had skin lesions (31.5%); six arthralgia or arthritis (31.5%) and eight neurological symptoms (42%). Interestingly, two patients showed antibodies directed to B. burgdorferi exclusively in cerebrospinal fluid. Since BYS is a new emergent Brazilian zoonosis and its diagnosis is sometimes complex, all the new knowledge about BYS must be scattered to Brazilian Medical specialists, aiming to teach them how to diagnose this amazing tick-borne disease and to avoid its progression to chronic irreversible sequels.

TI  - <i>FT</i>-like paralogs are repressed by an SVP protein during the floral transition in <i>Phalaenopsis</i> orchid
T2  - PLANT CELL REPORTS
AB  - Key message An SVP protein, PhSVP, bound to the CArG-boxes in the promoter regions of FT-like paralogs and repressed their expression, thus affecting the floral transition inPhalaenopsisorchid. Phalaenopsis is an important ornamental flower native to tropical rain forests. It usually reaches vegetative maturity after 4-5 leaves and, after a juvenile stage, forms a flower spike (inflorescence) from the axillary buds. The PEBP gene family encodes a phosphatidyl-ethanolamine-binding protein (PEBP) domain involved in regulating flowering and other aspects of plant development. Here, we identified eight PEBP family genes in Phalaenopsis and detected the expression patterns of seven of them in various organs. Among them, PhFT1 (Phalaenopsis hybrid FLOWERING LOCUS T1), PhFT3, PhFT5, and PhMFT (Phalaenopsis hybrid MOTHER OF FT AND TFL1) promoted flowering in transgenic Arabidopsis, while PhFT6 inhibited flowering. PhSVP (Phalaenopsis hybrid SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE), an SVP protein that repressed flowering in Arabidopsis, bound to the CArG-boxes in the promoter regions of PhFT3, PhFT6, and PhMFT in a yeast one-hybrid assay. Additionally, dual-luciferase and transient expression assays showed that PhSVP significantly inhibits the expression of both PhFT3 and PhFT6. Together, our work provides a comprehensive understanding of the PhFT-like genes that can promote or repress flowering, and it suggests strategies for regulating the floral transition in Phalaenopsis that exploit the evolutionary versatility of PhFTs to respond to various signals stimuli.

TI  - Tsetse flies: Their biology and control using area-wide integrated pest management approaches
T2  - JOURNAL OF INVERTEBRATE PATHOLOGY
AB  - Tsetse flies are the cyclical vectors of trypanosomes, the causative agents of 'sleeping sickness' or human African tiypanosomosis (HAT) in humans and 'nagana' or African animal trypanosomosis (AAT) in livestock in Sub-saharan Africa. Many consider HAT as one of the major neglected tropical diseases and AAT as the single greatest health constraint to increased livestock production. This review provides some background information on the taxonomy of tsetse flies, their unique way of reproduction (adenotrophic viviparity) making the adult stage the only one easily accessable for control, and how their ecological affinities, their distribution and population dynamics influence and dictate control efforts. The paper likewise reviews four control tactics (sequential aerosol technique, stationary attractive devices, live bait technique and the sterile insect technique) that are currently accepted as friendly to the environment, and describes their limitations and advantages and how they can best be put to practise in an IPM context. The paper discusses the different strategies for tsetse control i.e. localised versus area-wide and focusses thereafter on the principles of area-wide integrated pest management (AW-IPM) and the phased-conditional approach with the tsetse project in Senegal as a recent example. We argue that sustainable tsetse-free zones can be created on Africa mainland provided certain managerial and technical prerequisites are in place.

TI  - <i>Phellinus noxius</i> causes brown root rot on four important conifer species in Japan
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PATHOLOGY
AB  - The distribution of Phellinus noxius is currently limited to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast and East Asia, Oceania, Central America, and Africa. The ability of this pathogen to produce disease in temperate climates is unknown. We examined the pathogenicity of Phellinus noxius on four important conifer plantation species grown under temperate conditions in Japan. The inoculation experiment with two isolates of P. noxius from Japan demonstrated clear fungal pathogenicity on the four conifer species, 3 months post-inoculation. Typical disease symptoms ranged from wilting, leaf chlorosis and necrosis, and defoliation resulting in the eventual death of most saplings. Mortality rate varied depending on tree species and the fungal isolate used. The results suggest that the possibility of serious damage if P. noxius invades the temperate zone of Japan (e.g., Kyushu and/or Honshu) from subtropical areas of Japan such as the Ryukyu Islands or foreign countries as global warming progresses.

TI  - Biocontrol potential of <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> B1 against sapstain fungus in rubber wood
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PATHOLOGY
AB  - Rubber wood, one of the most preferred plantation timbers in the tropical regions, is easily prone to various moulds, decay and stain fungi. Lasiodiplodia theobromae, the dominant sapstain fungus of rubber wood, causes high economic loss to the industry through its bluish black sap wood discolouration. In our previous laboratory trials, Bacillus subtilis B1 isolated from market available compost was proved as a potent biocontrol agent against the sapstain fungus L. theobromae. The main aim of the present study was to demonstrate the biocontrol potential of B. subtilis B1 against rubber wood sapstain fungus on fresh rubber wood pieces during pre-monsoon, southwest monsoon and northeast monsoon seasons in the field. The visual ratings provided for the wood fungal growth and internal wood stain exhibited the bio-protectant efficiency of B. subtilis B1 even in the southwest monsoon season, which is considered as the most favourable period for the wood fungal growth. Biocontrol agent, B. subtilis B1 demonstrated significant inhibitions of sapstain fungus on open stacked rubber wood pieces in all the seasons. The frequent rainfalls during monsoon periods provide a conducive environment for fungal growth on felled rubber wood. Successful field evaluations of the biocontrol agent during pre-monsoon, monsoon and post-monsoon periods would guarantee year round protection against rubber wood sapstain. B. subtilis B1 displayed holistic biocontrol efficiency towards other stain (Ceratocystis sp., Fusarium sp.), mould (Aspergillus sp., Penicllium sp.) and decay fungi (Trametes versicolor) as well.

TI  - <i>Rickettsia helvetica</i> and <i>R-monacensis</i> infections in immature <i>Ixodes ricinus</i> ticks derived from sylvatic passerine birds in west-central Poland
T2  - PARASITOLOGY RESEARCH
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the importance of forest passerine birds in spreading ixodid ticks infected with rickettsiae of spotted fever group (SFG) in sylvatic habitats in western Poland. In total, 834 immature Ixodes ricinus ticks were found on 64 birds of 11 species which were captured during the tick-questing season between May and September of 2006. Ground-foraging passerines hosted most of the ticks compared with arboreal species, and therefore, only the former group was included into a detailed analysis. Significant predominance of larvae over nymphs was observed (581 vs. 253, respectively). Blackbirds and song thrushes hosted 82 % (n = 681) of the ticks collected from all infested passerines. The overall prevalence range of SF rickettsiae (including Rickettsia helvetica and Rickettsia monacensis) in bird-derived ticks was 10.5-26.9 %, exceeding that in questing ticks, and in ticks feeding on rodents and deer reported earlier from the same study area. This high prevalence of infection in immature I. ricinus ticks feeding on passerine birds strongly implies that they are involved in the enzootic maintenance of spotted fever group rickettsiae in the tick vector populations occurring in sylvatic habitats.

TI  - ANTIOXIDANT POTENTIAL AND PHENOLIC CONTENTS OF LEAF, BARK AND FRUIT OF <i>AEGLE MARMELOS</i>
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL FOREST SCIENCE
AB  - Free radicals produced during cellular metabolism are responsible for various diseases. Thus, looking for natural antioxidants from medicinal plants has now become an important research. Aegle marmelos, commonly known as bael, is a tropical tree valued for its medicinal properties and has been used to cure many diseases. In the present study, antioxidant activity and phenolic profile of the bael leaf, bark and fruit were investigated. The methanolic extracts of bael leaf, bark and fruit were assayed for their antioxidant activities using DPPH (2,2-diphenyl, 2-picrylhydrazyl) radical scavenging activity, reducing power and chelating metal ion power. The highest DPPH radical scavenging activity was observed in leaf methanolic extract (50% inhibition (IC50) value = 249.3 +/- 9.4 mu g mL(-1)) and least in fruit methanolic extract (IC50 = 1032.2 +/- 7.03 mu g mL(-1)). Highest chelating power was observed in leaf methanolic extract (IC50 = 165.7 +/- 2.3 mu g mL(-1)) and least in fruit methanolic extract(IC50 = 977 +/- 5.7 mu g mL(-1)) whereas the IC50 of reducing power ranged from 0.4 to 05 mu g mL(-1). Total phenolic content was highest in leaf methanolic extract (16.5 +/- 0.3 mg gallic acid equivalents (GAE) g(-1) dry weight) and lowest in fruit methanolic extract (10.6 +/- 0.3 mg GAE g(-1)). Reversed-phase HPLC analysis of the leaf, bark and fruit methanolic extracts, revealed the presence of different phenolic acids, viz. gallic acid, p-coumaric acid, vanillic acid, p-hydroxy benzoic acid, syringic acid, ferulic acid and chlorogenic acid.

TI  - Microorganisms of the Phyllosphere: Origin, Transport, and Ecological Functions
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
AB  - Microbes are ubiquitous residents of the atmosphere, including the air that we breathe. They are also widely present in terrestrial, marine, and aquatic environments. Typical microbes include viruses, fungi, archaea, bacteria, algae, and bryophytes. Many are of edaphic origin and play significant ecological roles in the soil. Propagules are exceedingly lightweight and small, generally measured in microns (millionths of a meter). Propagules achieve airborne status in the wind, where they may travel from a few millimeters to thousands of kilometers. Most have been recorded at least as high as the stratosphere. While airborne, microbes may pass through multiple generations. Microbes in the atmosphere are often accompanied by vast clouds of dust. They perform a variety of essential functions such as raindrop and snowflake condensation nuclei, without which there would be little or no precipitation. It is important to realize that all solid things that are carried up into the atmosphere must eventually fall back down to the Earth. When precipitated or deposited back onto the Earth, they may land on and occupy any surface, including trees and other plants where they become epiphytic residents. They have been documented on broad-leaved and needle-leaved trees from deserts to tropical rainforests. If they land on bare soil, they often participate in biological soil crusts that are important for soil stabilization and for water and nutrient cycling.

TI  - Development of a molecular tool for the identification of leishmania reservoir hosts by blood meal analysis in the insect vectors
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - The transmission of parasites of the genus Leishmania involves a large diversity of mammalian reservoir hosts. However, many of these are yet to be identified, mainly in isolated biotopes such as the Amazonian rain forest. Furthermore, the trophic preferences of insect vectors have major epidemiologic implications. In this study, we developed a molecular tool for the identification of blood meals of phlebotomine sand flies. This assay is based on specific amplification and sequencing of the blood meal-derived single copy prepronociceptin (PNOC) gene, which is used as a target in phylogenetic studies of mammals. Sand flies were identified simultaneously with the blood-meal identification, using molecular analysis of a ribosomal locus. After a systematic assessment of the sensitivity and specificity of polymerase chain reaction amplification of the PNOC gene using human fed sand flies, the assay was tested on wild-caught sand flies. This work has important implications for the discovery of new Leishmania reservoir hosts and for a better understanding of complex parasite life cycles.

TI  - Measuring spatial co-occurrences of species potentially involved in <i>Leishmania</i> transmission cycles through a predictive and fieldwork approach
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - The Leishmaniases are a group of neglected tropical diseases caused by different species of the protozoan parasite Leishmania, transmitted to its mammalian hosts by the bites of several species of female Phlebotominae sand flies. Many factors have contributed to shifts in the disease distribution and eco epidemiological outcomes, resulting in the emergence of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis outbreaks and the incrimination of vectors in unreported regions. New research development is vital for establishing the new paradigms of the present transmission cycles, hoping to facilitate new control strategies to reduce parasite transmission. Hereafter, this work aims to model and infer the current transmission cycles of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis in Colombia defined by vector and mammal species distributed and interacting in the different regions and validate them by performing sand fly and mammal collections. Vector-host co-occurrences were computed considering five ecoregions of the Colombian territory defined by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) and downloaded from The Nature Conservancy TNC Maps website. Four validation sites were selected based on Cutaneous Leishmaniasis prevalence reports. Sand flies and mammals captured in the field were processed, and species were defined using conventional taxonomic guidelines. Detection of infection by Leishmania was performed to identify transmission cycles in the selected areas. This study uses predictive models based on available information from international gazetteers and fieldwork to confirm sand fly and mammalian species' sustaining Leishmania transmission cycles. Our results show an uneven distribution of mammal samples in Colombia, possibly due to sampling bias, since only two departments contributed 50% of the available samples. Bats were the vertebrates with the highest score values, suggesting substantial spatial overlap with sand flies than the rest of the vertebrates evaluated. Fieldwork allowed identifying three circulating Leishmania species, isolated from three sand fly species. In the Montane Forest ecosystem, one small marsupial, Gracilinanus marica, was found infected with Leishmania panamensis, constituting the first record of this species infected with Leishmania. In the same locality, an infected sand fly, Pintomyia pia, was found. The overall results could support the understanding of the current transmission cycles of Leishmaniasis in Colombia.

TI  - Understanding Malaria Persistence: A Mixed-Methods Study on the Effectiveness of Malaria Elimination Strategies in South-Central Vietnam
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Despite the scale-up of vector control, diagnosis and treatment, and health information campaigns, malaria persists in the forested areas of South-Central Vietnam, home to ethnic minority populations. A mixed-methods study using an exploratory sequential design was conducted in 10 Ra-glai villages in Bac Ai district of Ninh Thuan province to examine which social factors limited the effectiveness of the national malaria elimination strategy in the local setting. Territorial arrangements and mobility were found to directly limit the effectiveness of indoor residual spraying and long-lasting insectidical treated nets (LLINs). Households (n=410) were resettled in the "new villages" by the government, where they received brick houses (87.1%) and sufficient LLINs (97.3%). However, 97.6% of households went back to their "old villages" to continue slash-and-burn agriculture. In the old village, 48.5% of households lived in open-structured plot huts and only 5.7% of them had sufficient LLIN coverage. Household representatives believed malaria could be cured with antimalarials (57.8%), but also perceived non-malarial medicines, rituals, and vitamin supplements to be effective against malaria. Household members (n = 1,957) used public health services for their most recent illness (62.9%), but also reported to buy low-cost medicines from the private sector to treat fevers and discomfort as these were perceived to be the most cost-effective treatment option for slash-and-burn farmers. The study shows the relevance of understanding social factors to improve the uptake of public health interventions and calls for contextually adapted strategies for malaria elimination in ethnic minority populations in Vietnam and similar settings.

TI  - TRADITIONAL MEDICINAL PLANTS IN BEN EN NATIONAL PARK, VIETNAM
T2  - BLUMEA
AB  - This paper surveys the medicinal plants and their traditional use by local people in Ben En National Park, Vietnam. A total of 230 medicinal plant species (belonging to 200 genera and 84 families) is used by local people for treatment of 68 different diseases. These include species that are collected in the wild (65%) as well as species grown in home gardens. Leaves, stems and roots are most commonly used either fresh or dried or by decocting the dried parts in water. Women are mainly responsible for health care, they have better knowledge of medicinal plants than men, and also collect them more than men at almost every age level. The indigenous knowledge of traditional medicinal plants may be rapidly lost because 43% of the Young generation do not know or do not want to learn about medicinal plants, and the remainder knows little about them. Moreover, nowadays local people tend to use western medicine. Eighteen medicinal plant species are commercialized and contribute on average 11% to the income of the households. The majority of medicinal species are used by less than half of the households and 68% of the medicinal plant species have use indices lower than 0.25. Only 6 of the medicinal species of Bell En are listed in the Red data list of Vietnam, but locally 18 medicinal species are endangered because of overharvesting.
   A comparison of traditional uses of medicinal plants in Ben Ell National Park with traditional uses elsewhere in South-East Asia and the Indo-Pacific region shows that the same species may be used for widely different treatments by different ethnic groups.
   The conservation, sustainable use and economic potential of medicinal plants is discussed. We argue that their use, cultivation in home gardens, and marketing should be encouraged as an affordable alternative to expensive western medicine.

TI  - Host plants of the most important virus that infect Cucumis melo (Cucurbitaceae) in Costa Rica
T2  - REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL
AB  - Natural hosts of four melon viruses (cucumber mosaic virus o CMV, papaya ringspot virus o PRSV, watermelon virus 2 o WMV-2 and zucchini yellow mosaic virus o ZYMV) were identified in two commercial melon farms in Costa Pica. The farms differed in management practices. Farm A had a long history of melon production in rotation with corn, sorghum and rice. Weed control was poor. Farm B was previously used as pastureland, had a shorter history of melon production, and was frequently plowed for weed control. Plant species diversity was monitored in 100 m(2) quadrants on each farm over a one year period. In addition to the cultivated areas, four distinct plant communities (improved pasture field, drainage ditches, secondary forest and fallow field) in farm A, and three (spontaneus mixed species pasture field, fallow field and secondary forest) in farm B were included in the study. The number of quadrants sampled was dependent on the total cultivated area on each farm. Five sampling dates were selected during rainy and dry seasons and transition periods between seasons. Plants of each species represented in the quadrants were collected at each sampling date and identified using reference collections. Four plants of each species showing virus-like symptoms in the field were tested for the presence of the four viruses by ELISA. The total number of plant species, and the percent ground cover of each species infected at least with one of the viruses were recorded on each of the five sampling dates. A total of 86 and 72 plant species were identified in sites A and B, respectively. Fourteen plant species, 16% of the total plant species represented in site A, and six species in site B (8%) were found to be infected with at least one of the four melon viruses at different times throughout the year. All four viruses were detected in each location at each of the five sampling dates, indicating that weed species naturally occurring in and around areas of commercial melon production serve as reservoirs for the melon viruses and ensure the survival of the viruses from one production season to the next. Several new host species of three of the melon viruses (PRSV, WMV-2 and ZYMV) were identified. Previously unreported hosts of PRSV included Tridax procumbens, Cleome viscosa. Cleome spinosa, Malvaviscus arboreus and Sida rhombifolia. New hosts of WMV-2 included C. viscosa, Crotum argenteus. Musa pardisiaca and Ponsetia heterophylla. New hosts of ZYMV included Guazuma ulmifolia, Rauvolfia tetraphylla, Malachra alceifolia. Boerhavia diffusa, P. heterophylla and C. viscosa.

TI  - Identifying the Role of E2 Domains on Alphavirus Neutralization and Protective Immune Responses
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and other alphaviruses are the etiologic agents of numerous diseases in both humans and animals. Despite this, the viral mediators of protective immunity against alphaviruses are poorly understood, highlighted by the lack of a licensed human vaccine for any member of this virus genus. The alphavirus E2, the receptor-binding envelope protein, is considered to be the predominant target of the protective host immune response. Although envelope protein domains have been studied for vaccine and neutralization in flaviviruses, their role in alphaviruses is less characterized. Here, we describe the role of the alphavirus E2 domains in neutralization and protection through the use of chimeric viruses.
   Methodology/Principal Findings
   Four chimeric viruses were constructed in which individual E2 domains of CHIKV were replaced with the corresponding domain from Semliki Forest virus (SFV) (Delta DomA/Delta DomB/Delta DomC/Delta DomA+B). Vaccination studies in mice (both live and inactivated virus) revealed that domain B was the primary determinant of neutralization. Neutralization studies with CHIKV immune serum from humans were consistent with mouse studies, as Delta DomB was poorly neutralized.
   Conclusions/Significance
   Using chimeric viruses, it was determined that the alphavirus E2 domain B was the critical target of neutralizing antibodies in both mice and humans. Therefore, chimeric viruses may have more relevance for vaccine discovery than peptide-based approaches, which only detect linear epitopes. This study provides new insight into the role of alphavirus E2 domains on neutralization determinants and may be useful for the design of novel therapeutic technologies.

TI  - Enzootic Circulation of Chikungunya Virus in East Africa: Serological Evidence in Non-human Kenyan Primates
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a globally emerging pathogen causing debilitating arthralgia and fever in humans. First identified in Tanzania (1953), this mosquito-borne alphavirus received little further attention until a 2004 re-emergence in Kenya from an unknown source. This outbreak subsequently spread to the Indian Ocean, with adaptation for transmission by a new urban vector. Under the hypothesis that sylvatic progenitor cycles of CHIKV exist in Kenya (as reported in West Africa, between non-human primates (NHPs) and arboreal Aedes spp. mosquitoes), we pursued evidence of enzootic transmission and human spillover events. We initially screened 252 archived NHP sera from Kenya using plaque reduction neutralization tests. Given an overall CHIKV seroprevalence of 13.1% (marginally higher in western Kenya), we sought more recent NHP samples during 2014 from sites in Kakamega County, sampling wild blue monkeys, olive baboons, and red-tailed monkeys (N = 33). We also sampled 34 yellow baboons near Kwale, coastal Kenya. Overall, CHIKV seropositivity in 2014 was 13.4% (9/67). Antibodies reactive against closely related o'nyong-nyong virus (ONNV) occurred; however, neutralization titers were too low to conclude ONNV exposure. Seroprevalence for the flavivirus dengue was also detected (28%), mostly near Kwale, suggesting possible spillback from humans to baboons. CHIKV antibodies in some juvenile and subadult NHPs suggested recent circulation. We conclude that CHIKV is circulating in western Kenya, despite the 2004 human outbreaks only being reported coastally. Further work to understand the enzootic ecology of CHIKV in east Africa is needed to identify sites of human spillover contact where urban transmission may be initiated.

TI  - Report of stranded skeletal system of Short-finned Pilot Whale from South Reef Island, Middle Andaman, India
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
AB  - Marine mammals are exceptionally significant animals with innumerable essential ecological roles in global aquatic ecosystems while the evolutionary divergence was taken place from the terrestrial habits. The adaptive radiation in aquatic life endorses various structural modifications in their general organization of body plan. Short-finned Pilot Whales (Globicephala macrorhynchus Gray, 1846) are predominantly distributed mostly in tropical and temperate regions of the world's oceans as one of the greatest social organisms which travel in higher speed in a group only with several individuals. Such practice of their social life is the prime risk for their population depletion as mass stranding across the world due to natural or anthropogenic threats while stranding of a single individual is a rare occurrence for this species and resulted mostly due to disease. During the present study, a stranded skeletal system (incomplete) of Short-finned Pilot Whale containing 49 parts (1 skull, 1 lower mandible, 3 ribs, 37 vertebrae, 1 scapula, 2 humeri, 2 radii, and 2 ulnae) were found at South Reef Island of Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Detailed cranial measurements were taken. Condylobasal length is 56.6 cm. This is the first stranding report of a solitary individual of Short-finned Pilot Whale in Andaman and Nicobar Islands.

TI  - Establishing research priorities for malaria elimination in the context of the emergency response to artemisinin resistance framework-the Cambodian approach
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
AB  - Background: Countries of the greater Mekong subregion have made a transition from malaria control to an aim for falciparum and vivax malaria elimination. The elimination of falciparum malaria will have to be achieved against a background of increasing artemisinin and multi-drug resistance. This ambitious goal requires an operational research (OR) agenda that addresses the dynamic challenges encountered on the path to elimination, which will need to be flexible and developed in close relation with the cambodian national programme for parasitology, entomology and malaria control (CNM). In Cambodia, a number of meetings with stakeholders were convened by the CNM and emergency response to artemisinin resistance (ERAR) hub, producing an initial list of priority OR topics. The process and outcome of these meetings are described, which could serve as a template for other countries in the region.
   Methods: A landscaping exercise was conducted to gather all past, on-going and planned malaria focussed OR activities conducted by the cambodian research consortium in Cambodia and categorized according to research theme. The six themes included (1) malaria epidemiology, surveillance and response, (2) malaria case management, (3) malaria vector control, (4) malaria behavioural issues, (5) malaria clinical studies, and (6) other vector-borne diseases (dengue, neglected tropical diseases, soil-transmitted helminths). The different themes were discussed in small focus groups, which made an initial prioritization list which was then presented to a plenary group for further discussion. This produced a list of research questions ranked according to priority.
   Results: OR priorities produced by the thematic groups were discussed in the plenary meeting and given a priority score by group voting. A list of 17 OR questions were developed, finalized and listed, which included questions on surveillance, active case detection and treatment efficacy.
   Conclusion: This paper describes ERAR's work on supporting Cambodia's transition to malaria elimination by identifying national operational research priorities. ERAR has initiated and currently plays a critical role in the development of country specific research agendas for malaria elimination. The first example of this has been the described exercise in Cambodia, which could serve a template for setting OR priorities in the wider region.

TI  - Air temperature suitability for <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> malaria transmission in Africa 2000-2012: a high-resolution spatiotemporal prediction
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
AB  - Background: Temperature suitability for malaria transmission is a useful predictor variable for spatial models of malaria infection prevalence. Existing continental or global models, however, are synoptic in nature and so do not characterize inter-annual variability in seasonal patterns of temperature suitability, reducing their utility for predicting malaria risk.
   Methods: A malaria Temperature Suitability Index (TSI) was created by first modeling minimum and maximum air temperature with an eight-day temporal resolution from gap-filled MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) daytime and night-time Land Surface Temperature (LST) datasets. An improved version of an existing biological model for malaria temperature suitability was then applied to the resulting temperature information for a 13-year data series. The mechanism underlying this biological model is simulation of emergent mosquito cohorts on a two-hour time-step and tracking of each cohort throughout its life to quantify the impact air temperature has on both mosquito survival and sporozoite development.
   Results: The results of this research consist of 154 monthly raster surfaces that characterize spatiotemporal patterns in TSI across Africa from April 2000 through December 2012 at a 1 km spatial resolution. Generalized TSI patterns were as expected, with consistently high values in equatorial rain forests, seasonally variable values in tropical savannas (wet and dry) and montane areas, and low values in arid, subtropical regions. Comparisons with synoptic approaches demonstrated the additional information available within the dynamic TSI dataset that is lost in equivalent synoptic products derived from long-term monthly averages.
   Conclusions: The dynamic TSI dataset presented here provides a new product with far richer spatial and temporal information than any other presently available for Africa. As spatiotemporal malaria modeling endeavors evolve, dynamic predictor variables such as the malaria temperature suitability data developed here will be essential for the rational assessment of changing patterns of malaria risk.

However, determining the effect of specific mutations that alter fidelity has been difficult because of the rapid selection of the virus population during replication. By deleting residues of the structural polyprotein PE2 cleavage site, E3 Delta 56-59, in Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) TC-83 vaccine strain, non-infectious virus particles were used to assess the effect of single mutations on mutation frequency without the interference of selection that results from multiple replication cycles. Next-generation sequencing analysis revealed a significantly lower frequency of transversion mutations and overall mutation frequency for the fidelity mutants compared to VEEV TC-83 E3 Delta 56-59. We demonstrate that deletion of the PE2 cleavage site halts virus infection while making the virus particles available for downstream sequencing. The conservation of the site will allow the evaluation of suspected fidelity mutants across alphaviruses of medical importance.

TI  - Antiplasmodial constituents in the minor alkaloid groups of the Amaryllidaceae
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
AB  - Malaria is responsible for majority of the morbidity and mortality statistics reflected by tropical diseases. Whilst effectively managed in most parts of the globe, it remains a scourge on the African continent where most cases of the disease are diagnosed annually. Plants have played a leading role as a source of malarial drugs which continue to dominate the clinical landscape today. Most if not all of these discoveries have as their basis evidence which can be traced back to traditional medicine. There is likewise precedence for the use of Amaryllidaceae plants in traditional medicinal approaches towards malaria. The chief phytochemical principles of the Amaryllidaceae are its isoquinoline alkaloids which are responsible for its diverse biological properties. These alkaloids may be divided into major and minor groups based on their distinguishing structural features as well as their natural abundance and distribution in the family. Whilst much has been written about the biological and chemical properties of the major alkaloid groups of the Amaryllidaceae, relatively little is known or understood about its minor alkaloid groups. This review focuses on the antiplasmodial activities described in the literature for the minor alkaloid group members of the Amaryllidaceae against various strains of the malarial pathogen Plasmodium falciparum. Three database platforms (Google Scholar, SciFinder and Scopus) were utilized for the literature search. Articles were accessed from journals licensed to the University of KwaZulu-Natal, or directly via the respective corresponding authors. Also considered are structural elements of these alkaloids which may be used to explain such activities as well as to provide a foundation in attempts to modulate activities. In addition, evidence is provided on the molecular basis to these effects which could guide efforts in drug discovery. (C) 2019 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Residual efficacy of deltamethrin applied to foliage against Malaysian <i>Aedes aegypti</i> (L.) and <i>Aedes albopictus</i> (Skuse)
T2  - TROPICAL BIOMEDICINE
AB  - The spraying of insecticide on foliage to provide an insecticidal barrier may serve as part of the vector control measures to combat the increasing threat of Aedes-borne diseases. The effectiveness of insecticide barrier spraying was evaluated by assessing the residual efficacy of deltamethrin sprayed on foliage against Malaysian Ae. aegypti (L.) and Ae. albopictus (Skuse). In this semi-field study, landscape plants grown within the vicinity of the Institute for Medical Research (IMR), Malaysia, were treated with deltamethrin suspension concentrate (SC) with the dosage of 30 mg/m(2) and 50 mg/m(2) in three rounds of spraying. Deltamethrin residual activity on treated and untreated leaves was investigated using standard WHO cone bioassays. Wild Aedes populations at both deltamethrin-treated and untreated plant clusters were monitored by ovitrap surveillance. Ovitrap monitoring revealed that the mean number of Ae. albopictus larvae at deltamethrin-treated were significantly lower than the mean number of larvae of the same species at the untreated plant cluster. Cone bioassay results showed that the insecticide remained effective for up to 4 weeks (> 80% mortality), but the insecticide residual activity was affected by rainfall. These results suggest that insecticide barrier spraying is a promising tool and may be used along with other mosquito control tools such as indoor residual spray and space spraying to reduce the dengue burden.

TI  - Effects of tea from <i>Turnera ulmifolia</i> L. on mouse gastric mucosa support the Turneraceae as a new source of antiulcerogenic drugs
T2  - BIOLOGICAL & PHARMACEUTICAL BULLETIN
AB  - Turnera ulmifolia is a plant belonging to the family Turneraceae, popularly known in Brazil as chanana. This species is distributed from Guyana to southern Brazil where it is considered a weed. The plant occurs in tropical rain forest, fields, and gardens. Chanana tea is used in Brazilian folk medicine for the treatment of diseases related mainly to gastric dysfunction including gastric and duodenal ulcers. In this study, the ability of a lyophilized infusion, as an aqueous fraction (AqF) of the aerial parts of T. ulmifolia, was investigated for its ability to prevent ulceration of the gastric and duodenal mucosa was examined in mice and rats, respectively. The AqF significantly reduced the formation of lesions associated with HCl/ethanol administration by 39% and 46%, respectively, at doses of 500 mg/kg and 1000 mg/kg, p.o. The AqF also significantly reduced the incidence of gastric lesions induced by a combination of indomethacin and bethanechol by 58% and 72% at doses of 500 mg/kg and 1000 mg/kg, respectively. In stress-induced gastric ulcer, the inhibition by the AqF was 48%, 57%, and 58% at doses of 250 mg/kg, 500 mg/kg, and 1000 mg/kg, respectively (p<0.05). A pyloric ligature experiment showed that the highest dose of the AqF significantly affected the gastric juice parameters by increasing the pH from 2.5 (control) to 5.3 and decreasing the acid output from 11.3 (control) to 3.7 mEq/ml/4 h. The AqF had no significant effect on duodenal ulcers induced by cysteamine. Preliminary phytochemical screening confirmed that flavonoids were the major constituents of the AqF of T. ulmifolia. These results indicate that this extract has a significant antiulcerogenic effect, as popularly believed.

T2  - REVISTA DA SOCIEDADE BRASILEIRA DE MEDICINA TROPICAL
AB  - Introduction: Rhodnius neglectus is a triatomine that colonizes different palm species. In this study, we aimed to describe the presence of this triatomine bug in the royal palms (Roystonea oleracea) in a rural region of the State of Goias. Methods: Palm infestation was investigated by dissecting the palms or by using live-bait traps. Results: Two palm trees were infested by R. neglectus negative for Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent for Chagas disease. In the study area, R. neglectus is frequently found in households. Conclusions: The adaptation of this species to palm trees introduced in Brazil for landscaping purposes poses another challenge for controlling the vectors of Chagas disease.

TI  - An underutilized orphan tuber crop-Chinese yam : a review
T2  - PLANTA
AB  - Main conclusion The diversification of food crops can improve our diets and address the effects of climate change, and in this context the orphan crop Chinese yam shows significant potential as a functional food. As the effects of climate change become increasingly visible even in temperate regions, there is an urgent need to diversify our crops in order to address hunger and malnutrition. This has led to the re-evaluation of neglected species such as Chinese yam (Dioscorea polystachyaTurcz.), which has been cultivated for centuries in East Asia as a food crop and as a widely-used ingredient in traditional Chinese medicine. The tubers are rich in nutrients, but also contain bioactive metabolites such as resistant starches, steroidal sapogenins (like diosgenin), the storage protein dioscorin, and mucilage polysaccharides. These health-promoting products can help to prevent cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and disorders of the gut microbiome. Whereas most edible yams are tropical species, Chinese yam could be cultivated widely in Europe and other temperate regions to take advantage of its nutritional and bioactive properties. However, this is a laborious process and agronomic knowledge is fragmented. The underground tubers contain most of the starch, but are vulnerable to breaking and thus difficult to harvest. Breeding to improve tuber shape is complex given the dioecious nature of the species, the mostly vegetative reproduction via bulbils, and the presence of more than 100 chromosomes. Protocols have yet to be established for in vitro cultivation and genetic transformation, which limits the scope of research. This article summarizes the sparse research landscape and evaluates the nutritional and medical applications of Chinese yam. By highlighting the potential of Chinese yam tubers, we aim to encourage the adoption of this orphan crop as a novel functional food.

TI  - Genetic diversity and variety composition of cassava on small-scale farms in Uganda: an interdisciplinary study using genetic markers and farmer interviews
T2  - GENETICA
AB  - Cassava is a tropical crop and grown for its tuberous starchy roots. In Africa it is mainly cultivated by small-scale farmers who observe, select and name their cassava varieties based on morphology, food, social and economic interest. Here we have used an interdisciplinary approach involving farmer interviews, genetic markers and morphological descriptors to study the composition of cassava varieties on small-scale farms in 11 villages located in three districts in Uganda, the genetic structure within and between these varieties and their morphology. The composition of local, newly introduced and improved varieties differed widely between villages and districts. The Ugandan farmers in our study seemed to adopt improved varieties to a greater extent when there was a nearby market, prevalence of disease epidemics and good extension service. We found considerable genetic variation both within and between cassava varieties though the variation was larger between varieties. However, most local and improved varieties showed predominating genotypes at many loci. Accessions of commonly grown varieties meeting farmers' preferences could therefore be selected and implemented in future breeding programmes involving development, dissemination and adoption. The like-named varieties in different villages were genetically similar, demonstrating farmers' ability to differentiate and maintain the same variety over large areas. However, some varieties with different names in different villages showed both genetic and morphological similarity, suggesting that farmers may rename plants when they are introduced into their fields. The large differences found in variety and genetic composition between villages and districts in Uganda may be a result of the diverse needs and growing conditions characteristic for traditional farming system. This suggests that efforts to conserve and increase the genetic diversity in farmers' fields will require policies tailored to each area.

TI  - Long-Short Term Memory Technique for Monthly Rainfall Prediction in Thale Sap Songkhla River Basin, Thailand
T2  - SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB  - Rainfall is a primary factor for agricultural production, especially in a rainfed agricultural region. Its accurate prediction is therefore vital for planning and managing farmers' plantations. Rainfall plays an important role in the symmetry of the water cycle, and many hydrological models use rainfall as one of their components. This paper aimed to investigate the applicability of six machine learning (ML) techniques (i.e., M5 model tree: (M5), random forest: (RF), support vector regression with polynomial (SVR-poly) and RBF kernels (SVR- RBF), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and long-short-term memory (LSTM) in predicting for multiple-month ahead of monthly rainfall. The experiment was set up for two weather gauged stations located in the Thale Sap Songkhla basin. The model development was carried out by (1) selecting input variables, (2) tuning hyperparameters, (3) investigating the influence of climate variables on monthly rainfall prediction, and (4) predicting monthly rainfall with multi-step-ahead prediction. Four statistical indicators including correlation coefficient (r), mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and overall index (OI) were used to assess the model's effectiveness. The results revealed that large-scale climate variables, particularly sea surface temperature, were significant influence variables for rainfall prediction in the tropical climate region. For projections of the Thale Sap Songkhla basin as a whole, the LSTM model provided the highest performance for both gauged stations. The developed predictive rainfall model for two rain gauged stations provided an acceptable performance: r (0.74), MAE (86.31 mm), RMSE (129.11 mm), and OI (0.70) for 1 month ahead, r (0.72), MAE (91.39 mm), RMSE (133.66 mm), and OI (0.68) for 2 months ahead, and r (0.70), MAE (94.17 mm), RMSE (137.22 mm), and OI (0.66) for 3 months ahead.

TI  - Host thermoregulatory constraints predict growth of an amphibian chytrid pathogen (<i>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</i>)
T2  - JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY
AB  - 1. The course and outcome of many wildlife diseases are context-dependent, and therefore change depending on the behaviour of hosts and environmental response of the pathogen.
   2. Contemporary declines in amphibian populations are widely attributed to chytridiomycosis, caused by the pathogenic fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. Despite the thermal sensitivity of the pathogen and its amphibian hosts, we do not understand how host thermal regimes experienced by frogs in the wild directly influence pathogen growth.
   3. We tested how thermal regimes experienced by the rainforest frog Litoria rheocola in the wild influence pathogen growth in the laboratory, and whether these responses differ from pathogen growth under available environmental thermal regimes.
   4. Frog thermal regimes mimicked in the laboratory accelerated pathogen growth during conditions representative of winter at high elevations more so than if temperatures matched air or stream water temperatures. By contrast, winter frog thermal regimes at low elevations slowed pathogen growth relative to air temperatures, but not water temperatures.
   5. The growth pattern of the fungus under frog thermal regimes matches field prevalence and intensity of infections for this species (high elevation winter > high elevation summer > low elevation winter > low elevation summer), whereas pathogen growth trajectories under environmental temperatures did not match these patterns.
   6. If these laboratory results translate into field responses, tropical frogs may be able to reduce disease impacts by regulating their body temperatures to limit pathogen growth (e.g., by using microhabitats that facilitate basking to reach high temperatures); in other cases, the environment may limit the ability of frogs to thermoregulate such that individuals are more vulnerable to this pathogen (e.g., in dense forests at high elevations).
   7. Species-specific thermoregulatory behaviour, and interactions with and constraints imposed by the environment, are therefore essential to understanding and predicting the spatial and temporal impacts of this global disease.

TI  - Immunohematological features of free-living <i>Alouatta belzebul</i> (Linnaeus, 1766) red-handed howler monkeys in the Eastern Amazon
T2  - PRIMATES
AB  - The red-handed howler monkey (Alouatta belzebul) is one of the 35 threatened Brazilian primate species found in two highly endangered Brazilian biomes. Their Amazonian native populations have been declining due to exponential deforestation associated with human activities, especially the construction of dams. The studied population (n = 27) was located in the Belo Monte dam Area of Influence. For the first time, we presented hematological parameters and the basic profile of T (CD3) and B (BSAP PAX5) cells by immunocytochemistry. The results supported the hypothesis that the immuno-hematological profile is influenced by sex, age, and season. Eosinophils were significantly higher in females (p = 0.03), monocytes statistically greater in juveniles (p = 0.04), and total plasma protein increased significantly (p > 0.001) during the dry season. Furthermore, adults showed a statistically higher average absolute number of B lymphocytes than young individuals (p = 0.03), in contrast to T lymphocytes. Even without knowing the full history of antigenic exposure, these results not only contribute to elucidating the boundaries between health and disease but may help lay the groundwork for future research into the effects of anthropogenic stress on immune activation.

TI  - Risk Factors for Border Malaria in a Malaria Elimination Setting: A Retrospective Case-Control Study in Yunnan, China
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - A retrospective case-control study was conducted to identify risk factors for border malaria in a malaria elimination setting of Yunnan Province, China. The study comprised 214 cases and 428 controls. The controls were individually matched to the cases on the basis of residence, age, and gender. In addition, statistical associations are based on matched analyses. The frequencies of imported, male, adult, and vivax malaria cases were respectively 201 (93.9%), 194 (90.7%), 210 (98.1%), and 176 (82.2%). Overnight stay in Myanmar within the prior month was independently associated with malaria infection (odds ratio [OR] 159.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 75.1-338.9). In particular, stays in lowland and foothill (OR 5.5,95% CI 2.5-11.8) or mid-hill (OR 42.8,95% CI 5.1-319.8) areas, or near streamlets (OR 15.3, 95% CI 4.3-55.2) or paddy field or pools (OR10.1, 95% CI 4.4-55.8) were found to be independently associated with malaria. Neither forest exposure nor use of vector control measures was associated with malaria. In conclusion, travel to lowland and foothill or mid-hill hyperendemic areas, especially along the waterside in Myanmar, was found to be the highest risk factor for malaria. In considering the limitations of the study, further investigations are needed to identify the major determinants of malaria risk and develop new strategies for malaria elimination on China-Myanmar border.

T2  - ARCHIVES OF MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Gymnema sylvestre is a tropical climber species that is widely used in traditional medicine since ages. In the present study, the transcriptome datasets of G. sylvestre available in public domain were screened for the presence of novel plant viral sequences and a putative novel virus tentatively named as Gymnema sylvestre virus 1 (GysV1) was identified. Coding-complete genome segments of GysV1 that are 6.35 kb (RNA1) and 3.98 kb (RNA2) long possessed a single large open reading frame coding for a polyprotein. BLASTp, sequence identity and phylogenetic analyses revealed the relatedness of GysV1 to the members of the subgenus Cholivirus (genus Sadwavirus; family Secoviridae; order Picornavirales). Based on the species demarcation criteria of the family Secoviridae, GysV1 can be regarded as a new cholivirus member.

TI  - Wild robusta coffee (<i>Coffea canephora </i>Froehner) seedling recruitment and survival in Kibale National Park, Uganda
T2  - ISRAEL JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCES
AB  - Survival of wild robusta coffee (Coffea canephora) seedlings on the forest understorey in Kibale National Park was monitored and analyzed in response to a number of mortality factors, such as fungal diseases, herbivory, desiccation, trampling, and litter of other plant species. A comparison was made with wild coffee seedlings germinated in the laboratory and transplanted in the Botanic Garden under two light conditions.
   There was a general decrease in the number of coffee seedlings with time under all treatments and in all sites. Seedling mortality rate was initially rapid but later slowed down to a steady rate. Seedling mortality was highest on plots with intact ground vegetation cover and lowest on plots without ground vegetation and leaf litter. In the Botanic Garden, seedlings grown on plots partially illuminated had a much lower mortality rate and longer half-life than those grown on fully illuminated plots.
   Fungal infection affected the largest percentage of coffee seedlings, followed by herbivory. Trampling had the least effect on coffee seedlings. The effects of all mortality factors an coffee seedlings decreased with age under all treatments.

TI  - Phlebotomine Sand Flies (Diptera: Psychodidae) and <i>Leishmania</i> Infection in Gafanhoto Park, Divinopolis, Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - The potential of Gafanhoto Park as an American cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL) focus was evaluated by examination of sand fly vectors of the Leishmania parasite. This forest remnant is located in a periurban area of Divinopolis, Brazil, where autochthonous cases of ACL have been reported. Sand fly populations were monitored over a 2-yr period (2006-2008) by using light traps (HP and Shannon). During systematic collections with HP traps, 824 specimens in total (342 males and 482 females) of 21 species were captured. Most prevalent species were as follows: Brumptomyia brumpti (Larrouse), Lutzomyia aragaoi (Costa Lima), Lutzomyia lutziana (Costa Lima), Lutzomyia sordellii (Shannon & Del Ponte), and Lutzomyia whitmani (Antunes & Coutinho). Using Shannon traps, 257 specimens representing 15 species were collected (159 females and 98 males), with a high prevalence of L. whitmani and Lutzomyia neivai (Pinto), both vectors of Leishmania braziliensis (Vianna). To ascertain the level of natural infection, a sample of females captured in Shannon traps was assayed for the presence of Leishmania by using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism, where 39% of insects were positive. The most infected species was L. whitmani (29 sand flies; 18.2%), followed by L. neivai (21; 13.2%), Lutzomyia christenseni (Young & Duncan) (five; 3.1%), Lutzomyia pessoai (Coutinho & Barreto) (three; 1.9%), L. aragaoi (one; 0.6%), Lutzomyia fischeri (Pinto) (one; 0.6%), Lutzomyia lenti (Mangabeira) (one; 0.6%), L. lutziana (one; 0.6%), and Lutzomyia monticula (Costa Lima) (one; 0.6%). The finding of potential and incriminated vectors naturally infected with Leishmania reinforces the need of epidemiologic surveillance in the area.

TI  - Seasonal and Spatial Environmental Influence on <i>Opisthorchis viverrini</i> Intermediate Hosts, Abundance, and Distribution: Insights on Transmission Dynamics and Sustainable Control
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   Opisthorchis viverrini (Ov) is a complex-life-cycle trematode affecting 10 million people in SEA (Southeast Asia). Human infection occurs when infected cyprinid fish are consumed raw or undercooked. Ov requires three hosts and presents two free-living parasitic stages. As a consequence Ov transmission and infection in intermediate and human hosts are strongly mediated by environmental factors and understanding how environmental variability influences intermediate host abundance is critical. The objectives of this study were 1) to document water parameters, intermediate hosts abundance and infection spatio-temporal variation, 2) to assess their causal relationships and identify windows of transmission risk.
   Methodology/Principal Findings
   Fish and snails were collected monthly for one year at 12 sites in Lawa Lake, an Ov-endemic region of Khon Kaen Province in Northeast Thailand. Physicochemical water parameters [ pH, temperature (Tp), dissolved oxygen (DO), Salinity, electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solid (TDS), nitrite nitrogen (NO2-N), lead (Pb), total coliform bacteria (TCB) and fecal coliform bacteria (FCB)] were measured. Multivariate analyses, linear models and kri-ging were used to characterize water parameter variation and its influence on host abundance and infection prevalence. We found that sampling sites could be grouped in three clusters and discriminated along a nitrogen-salinity gradient where higher levels in the lake's southern region predicted higher Bithynia relative abundance (P<0.05) and lower snail and fish species diversity (P<0.05). Highest Bithynia abundance occurred during rainy season (P<0.001), independently of site influence. Cyprinids were the most abundant fish family and higher cyprinid relative abundance was found in areas with higher Bithynia relative abundance (P<0.05). Ov infection in snails was anecdotal while Ov infection in fish was higher in the southern region (P<0.001) at sites showing high FCB.
   Conclusions/Significance
   Our results indicate that water contamination and waterways configuration can influence freshwater communities' assemblages possibly creating ideal conditions for sustained transmission. Sustainable control may require a better appreciation of the system's ecology with wise governance and development planning particularly in the current context of SEA agricultural intensification and landscape modification.

TI  - Ecological niche modelling and predicted geographic distribution of <i>Lutzomyia cruzi</i>, vector of <i>Leishmania infantum</i> in South America
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - In some transmission foci of Leishmania infantum in Brazil, Lutzomyia cruzi could be considered the main vector of this pathogen. In addition, L. cruzi is a permissive vector of L. amazonensis. Its geographical distribution seems to be restricted and limited to Cerrado and Pantanal biomes, which includes some areas in Brazil and Bolivia. Considering that predicting the distribution of the species involved in transmission cycles is an effective approach for assessing human disease risk, this study aims to predict the spatial distribution of L. cruzi using a multiscale ecological niche model based in both climate and habitat variables. Ecological niche modelling was used to identify areas in South America that are environmentally suitable for this particular vector species, but its presence is not recorded. Vector occurrence records were compiled from the literature, museum collections and Brazilian Health Departments. Bioclimatic variables, altitude, and land use and cover were used as predictors in five ecological niche model algorithms: BIOCLIM, generalised linear model (logistic regression), maximum entropy, random forests, and support vector machines. The vector occurs in areas where annual mean temperature values range from 21.76 degrees C to 26.58 degrees C, and annual total precipitation varies from 1005 mm and 2048 mm. Urban areas were most present around capture locations. The potential distribution area of L. cruzi according to the final ecological niche model spans Brazil and Bolivia in patches of suitable habitats inside a larger climatically favourable area. The bigger portion of this suitable area is located at Brazilian States of Mato Grosso do Sul and Mato Grosso. Our findings identified environmentally suitable areas for L. cruzi in regions without its known occurrence, so further field sampling of sand flies is recommended, especially in southern Goia A s State, Mato Grosso do Sul (borders with Mato Grosso, Sao Paulo and Minas Gerais); and in Bolivian departments Santa Cruz and El Beni.

TI  - Yaws disease in a wild gorilla population and its impact on the reproductive status of males
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY
AB  - We evaluated the prevalence of skin lesions in a gorilla population in the Republic of Congo. The observed lesions were typical of yaws, a treponematosis described in gorillas and humans living in tropical regions. Among the 377 gorillas identified, 17% presented skin lesions, mainly on their faces. The worst cases presented physical handicaps because of the deep lesions. As in humans, lesions break out when individuals are young. Lesions were more prevalent among males than females above 8 years old. This sex-bias prevalence could result from the behavioral characteristics of males through a greater exposure to wounds. Lesions were also more prevalent in unmated adult males (either solitaries or those living in nonbreeding groups) than in males leading breeding groups. In the case of the latter, nonaffected and affected leading males had a similar number of infants and juveniles. Still, none of the leading males ever presented serious handicaps because of the skin lesions. This suggests that adult females could favor males without lesions. Finally, lesions were more prevalent among immature animals in nonbreeding groups than in breeding groups, suggesting that either young animals with lesions disperse earlier from their natal groups, or that the disease spreads faster in nonbreeding groups. Our results provide some insights into the spread of a disease in a wild population. Further studies are required to determine if the vigor of males affects the development of the disease and if affected individuals experience social discrimination inducing a negative impact on population dynamics.

TI  - Marine aquaculture as a source of propagules of invasive fouling species
T2  - PEERJ
AB  - Non-indigenous species tend to colonize aquaculture installations, especially when they are near international ports. In addition to the local environmental hazard that colonizing non-indigenous species pose, they can also take advantage of local transport opportunities to spread elsewhere. In this study, we examined the risk of the spread of eight invasive fouling species that are found in mussel farms in southern Brazil. We used ensemble niche models based on worldwide occurrences of these species, and environmental variables (ocean temperature and salinity) to predict suitable areas for each species with three algorithms (Maxent, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine). As a proxy for propagule pressure, we used the tonnage transported by container ships from Santa Catarina (the main mariculture region) that travel to other Brazilian ports. We found that ports in the tropical states of Pernambuco, Ceara, and Bahia received the largest tonnage, although far from Santa Catarina and in a different ecoregion. The ascidians Aplidium accarense and Didemnum perlucidum are known from Bahia, with a high risk of invasion in the other states. The bryozoan Watersipora subtorquata also has a high risk of establishment in Pernambuco, while the ascidian Botrylloides giganteus has a medium risk in Bahia. Parana, a state in the same ecoregion as Santa Catarina is likely to be invaded by all species. A second state in this region, Rio Grande do Sul, is vulnerable to A. accarense, the barnacle Megabalanus coccopoma, and the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis. Climate change is changing species latitudinal distributions and most species will gain rather than lose area in near future (by 2050). As an ideal habitat for fouling organisms and invasive species, aquaculture farms can increase propagule pressure and thus the probability that species will expand their distributions, especially if they are close to ports. Therefore, an integrated approach of the risks of both aquaculture and nautical transport equipment present in a region is necessary to better inform decision-making procedures aiming at the expansion or establishment of new aquaculture farms. The risk maps provided will allow authorities and regional stakeholders to prioritize areas of concern for mitigating the present and future spread of fouling species.

TI  - Role of maternal health and infant inflammation in nutritional and neurodevelopmental outcomes of two-year old Bangladeshi children
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   Previous studies have shown maternal, inflammatory, and socioeconomic variables to be associated with growth and neurodevelopment in children from low-income countries. However, these outcomes are multifactorial and work describing which predictors most strongly influence them is lacking.
   Methodology/Principal findings
   We conducted a longitudinal study of Bangladeshi children from birth to two years to assess oral vaccine efficacy. Variables pertaining to maternal and perinatal health, socioeconomic status, early childhood enteric and systemic inflammation, and anthropometry were collected. Bayley-III neurodevelopmental assessment was conducted at two years. As a secondary analysis,we employed hierarchical cluster and random forests techniques to identify and rank which variables predicted growth and neurodevelopment. Cluster analysis demonstrated three distinct groups of predictors. Mother's weight and length-for-age Z score (LAZ) at enrollment were the strongest predictors of LAZ at two years. Cognitive score on Bayley-III was strongly predicted by weight-for-age (WAZ) at enrollment, income, and LAZ at enrollment. Top predictors of language included Rotavirus vaccination, plasma IL 5, sCD14, TNF alpha, mother's weight, and male gender. Motor function was best predicted by fecal calprotectin, WAZ at enrollment, fecal neopterin, and plasma CRP index. The strongest predictors for social-emotional score included plasma sCD14, income, WAZ at enrollment, and LAZ at enrollment. Based on the random forests' predictions, the estimated percentage of variation explained was 35.4% for LAZ at two years, 34.3% for ALAZ, 42.7% for cognitive score, 28.1% for language, 40.8% for motor, and 37.9% for social-emotional score.
   Conclusions/Significance
   Birth anthropometry and maternal weight were strong predictors of growth while enteric and systemic inflammation had stronger associations with neurodevelopment. Birth anthropometry was a powerful predictor for all outcomes. These data suggest that further study of stunting in low-income settings should include variables relating to maternal and prenatal health, while investigations focusing on neurodevelopmental outcomes should additionally target causes of systemic and enteric inflammation.

TI  - Phenotype Characterization of Pelibuey Native Lambs Resistant to <i>Haemonchus contortus</i>
T2  - ANIMAL BIODIVERSITY AND EMERGING DISEASES: PREDICTION AND PREVENTION
CP  - 9th Biennial Conference on Animal Biodiversity and Emerging Diseases - Prediction and Prevention
AB  - Specific phenotypic traits of the blood-feeder nematode Haemonchus contortus were characterized on Pelibuey native, cross-breed sheep in a tropical region of Mexico with background of anthelmintic problems. Data were collected on 4-month-old lambs (n = 63) and analyzed weekly in three stages: stage 1 (S1, not infected (0-3 weeks)); S2, first infection with 350 H. contortus infective larvae (L-3) per kg of body weight by oral route (3-10 weeks); and S3, second infection with 175 H. contortus L3 per kg of body weight by oral route (10-18 weeks). Once infection took place, sheep grazed in a free-nematode experimental paddock, and hemoncosis-related traits, such as the number of eggs per gram of feces (epg), packed cell volume (%pvc), and eosinophils (%eo), were measured each week. Results were analyzed on specific traits and stages using SAS statistics. Statistical differences of the main phenotypic traits (P < 0.05) were observed throughout S2 on Pelibuey high (hr) and low (lr) responders, respectively: epg mean, 475 +/- 340.5 and 1439 +/- 243.6; %pvc mean, 31 +/- 0.3 and 27 +/- 0.2; and %eo mean, 2.5 +/- 0.3 and 1.99 +/- 0.2. In addition, lr and hr sheep grazed for 3 months on an area infected with Haemonchus, Cooperia, and Strongyloides, and the hr sheep showed a low number of epg after being exposed to multiple infections, so that no further treatment was required. These results showed that the selection of animals resistant to nematodes can be an alternative method of control against anthelmintic resistance problems in order to improve animal health and avoid a negative environmental impact.

TI  - <i>In vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> anti-inflammatory effects of taheebo, a water extract from the inner bark of <i>Tabebuia avellanedae</i>
T2  - JOURNAL OF ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY
AB  - Aim of study: Tabebuia spp. (Bignoniaceae) are native to tropical rain forests throughout Central and South America and have long been used as a folk medicine to treat bacterial infection, blood coagulation. cancer and inflammatory diseases. In this study, we aimed to demonstrate the ethnopharmacological activity of Tabebuia avellanedae in various in vitro and in vivo inflammatory conditions.
   Materials and methods: To do this, LPS-stimulated macrophages and arachidonic acid or croton oil-induced mouse ear edema models were employed.
   Results: The water extract (taheebo) of Tabebuia avellanedae significantly suppressed the production of prostaglandin (PG) E-2 and nitric oxide (NO), and blocked the mRNA expression of their catalyzing enzymes (cyclooxygenase [COX)-II] and inducible NO synthase [iNOS], respectively), in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. The blockade of inflammatory mediators by taheebo seemed to be the result of the interruption of extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) activation, according to immunoblotting analysis and the NO assay, where LPS strongly induced the phosphorylation (a hallmark of activation) of ERK, and U0126, a selective ERK inhibitor, was found to strongly inhibit PGE(2) production. Similarly, oral administration of taheebo (100 mg/kg) for I week completely diminished mouse ear edema induced by arachidonic acid, an activator of COX-II, but not croton oil, an activator of lipoxygenase.
   Conclusions: These data suggest that the ethnopharmacological action of taheebo maybe due to its negative modulation of macrophage-mediated inflammatory responses by suppressing PGE(2) production. Thus, this water extract may be developed as a new therapeutic remedy for various inflammatory diseases such as arthritis and atherosclerosis. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Modulation of inflammatory pathways, medicinal uses and toxicities of<i>Uvaria</i>species: potential role in the prevention and treatment of inflammation
T2  - INFLAMMOPHARMACOLOGY
AB  - The therapeutic efficacy of the contemporary anti-inflammatory drugs are well established; however, prolonged use of such can often lead to serious and life-threatening side effects. Natural product-based anti-inflammatory compounds with superior efficacy and minimum toxicity can serve as possible therapeutic alternatives in this scenario. GenusUvariais a part of Annonaceae family, while the majority of its species are widely distributed in tropical rain forest regions of South East Asia.Uvariaspecies have been used extensively used as traditional medicine for treating all sorts of inflammatory diseases including catarrhal inflammation, rheumatism, acute allergic reactions, hemorrhoids, inflammatory liver disease and inflamed joints. Phytochemical analysis ofUvariaspecies has revealed flavones, flavonoids, tannins, saponins, polyoxygenated cyclohexene and phenolic compounds as major phyto-constituents. This review is an attempt to highlight the anti-inflammatory activity ofUvariaspecies by conducting a critical appraisal of the published literature. The ethnopharmacological relevance ofUvariaspecies in the light of toxicological studies is also discussed herein. An extensive and relevant literature on anti-inflammatory activity ofUvariaspecies was collected from available books, journals and electronic databases including PubMed, ScienceDirect, Scopus, Proquest and Ovid. Extracts and isolates ofUvariaspecies exhibited significant anti-inflammatory activity through various mechanisms of action. 6,7-di-O-Methyl-baicalein, flexuvarol B, chrysin, (-)-zeylenol, 6-hydroxy-5,7-dimethoxy-flavone, and pinocembrin were the most potent anti-inflammatory compounds with comparable IC(50)with positive controls. Therefore, it is suggested that further research should be carried out to determine the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and toxicity of these therapeutically significant compounds, to convert the pre-clinical results into clinical data for drug development and design.

TI  - Complex antigen presentation pathway for an HLA-A*0201-restricted epitope from Chikungunya 6K protein
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   The adaptive cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated immune response is critical for clearance of many viral infections. These CTL recognize naturally processed short viral antigenic Peptides bound to human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I molecules on the surface of infected cells. This specific recognition allows the killing of virus-infected cells. The T cell immune T cell response to Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), a mosquito-borne Alpha virus of the Togaviridae family responsible for severe musculoskeletal disorders, has not been fully defined; nonetheless, the importance of HLA class I-restricted immune response in this virus has been hypothesized.
   Methodology/Principal findings
   By infection of HLA-A*0201-transgenic mice with a recombinant vaccinia virus that encodes the CHIKV structural polyprotein (rVACV-CHIKV), we identified the first human T cell epitopes from CHIKV. These three novel 6K transmembrane protein-derived epitopes are presented by the common HLA class I molecule, HLA-A*0201. One of these epitopes is processed and presented via a complex pathway that involves proteases from different subcellular locations. Specific chemical inhibitors blocked these events in rVACV-CHIKV-infected cells.
   Conclusions/Significance
   Our data have implications not only for the identification of novel Alpha virus and Togaviridae antiviral CTL responses, but also for analyzing presentation of antigen from viruses of different families and orders that use host proteinases to generate their mature envelope proteins.
   Author summary
   The arboviral pathogen Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a serious threat to global health, and is considered a priority re-emerging virus. This pathogen causes acute febrile infection in patients, leading to debilitating arthralgia and arthritis. In recent years, CHIKV has spread quickly in tropical and subtropical countries, causing outbreaks of more severe forms of the disease than previously reported. The nature and function of the T cell immune response, critical for clearance of viral infections, is largely unknown during acute and chronic CHIKV disease and their association with rheumatic disorders. In this study, we identified the three first CHIKV epitopes recognized by human T cells. We studied how one of these epitopes is generated in virus-infected cells, a process that involves the sequential proteolytic activity of several proteases at distinct subcellular locations. We postulate that this process could have broad implications when applied to other viral proteins.

TI  - Metabolites Profiling of <i>Manilkara mabokeensis</i> Aubrev Bark and Investigation of Biological Activities
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB  - Manilkara mabokeensis Aubrev is a tree that belongs to the Sapotaceae family, native to the tropical forest in Latin America, Asia, Australia, and Africa. The bark of this species is used as traditional medicine to treat diseases. The present study is the first phytochemical investigation on M. mabokeensis Aubrev bark in terms of phytochemical composition and bioactivity. Among the different extracts, ethyl acetate (EtOAc) exhibited the highest values of total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), condensed tannin content (CTC), and reducing sugar content, as well as a high antioxidant activity. Interestingly, gas chromatography-flame ionization detector (GC-FID) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis were enabled to identify 23 compounds in the essential oil of M. mabokeensis Aubrev bark, which have not been previously described in the literature. Phytol and 8,14-cedranoxide were the major identified compounds, with area percentages of 27.9 and 18.8%, respectively. For HPLC analysis, 3,4-dihydroxy-benzoic acid methyl ester showed the highest concentration with 61.8 mg/g of dry residue (dr) among other identified molecules. Manilkara mabokeensis Aubrev bark MeOH extract showed a good anti-15-lipoxygenase (anti-15-LOX) and anti-acetylcholinesterase (anti-AChE) activities of 65.8 and 71.0%, respectively, while it exhibited a moderate antixanthine oxidase (anti-XOD) activity (41.5%) at 50 mu g/mL. Furthermore, cyclohexane (CYHA) and ethyl acetate induced the highest cytotoxicity against the human ovarian cancer cell lines, OVCAR (49.5%) and IGROV (48.7%), respectively. Taken together, obtained results argue that M. mabokeensis Aubrev bark is an excellent source of natural compounds and justify its use in folk medicine.

TI  - Predicting spatial spread of rabies in skunk populations using surveillance data reported by the public
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   Prevention and control of wildlife disease invasions relies on the ability to predict spatio-temporal dynamics and understand the role of factors driving spread rates, such as seasonality and transmission distance. Passive disease surveillance (i.e., case reports by public) is a common method of monitoring emergence of wildlife diseases, but can be challenging to interpret due to spatial biases and limitations in data quantity and quality.
   Methodology/Principal findings
   We obtained passive rabies surveillance data from dead striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis) in an epizootic in northern Colorado, USA. We developed a dynamic patch-occupancy model which predicts spatio-temporal spreading while accounting for heterogeneous sampling. We estimated the distance travelled per transmission event, direction of invasion, rate of spatial spread, and effects of infection density and season. We also estimated mean transmission distance and rates of spatial spread using a phylogeographic approach on a subsample of viral sequences from the same epizootic. Both the occupancy and phylogeographic approaches predicted similar rates of spatio-temporal spread. Estimated mean transmission distances were 2.3 km (95% Highest Posterior Density (HPD95): 0.02, 11.9; phylogeographic) and 3.9 km (95% credible intervals (CI95): 1.4, 11.3; occupancy). Estimated rates of spatial spread in km/year were: 29.8 (HPD95: 20.8, 39.8; phylogeographic, branch velocity, homogenous model), 22.6 (HPD95: 15.3, 29.7; phylogeographic, diffusion rate, homogenous model) and 21.1 (CI95: 16.7, 25.5; occupancy). Initial colonization probability was twice as high in spring relative to fall.
   Conclusions/Significance
   Skunk-to-skunk transmission was primarily local (< 4 km) suggesting that if interventions were needed, they could be applied at the wave front. Slower viral invasions of skunk rabies in western USA compared to a similar epizootic in raccoons in the eastern USA implies host species or landscape factors underlie the dynamics of rabies invasions. Our framework provides a straightforward method for estimating rates of spatial spread of wildlife diseases.

TI  - Enhancers in Proboscis Monkey: A Primer
T2  - PERTANIKA JOURNAL OF TROPICAL AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE
AB  - Enhancers are indispensable elements in various developmental stages, orchestrating numerous biological processes via the elevation of gene expression with the aid of transcription factors. Enhancer variations have been linked to various onset of genetic diseases, highlighting their equal importance as the coding regions in the genome. Despite the first enhancer, SV40 been discovered four decades ago, the progress in enhancer identification and characterization is still in its infancy. As more genome sequences are made available, especially from that of the non-human primates, we can finally study the enhancer landscape of these primates that differs evolutionarily from that of human. One interesting genome to investigate is that of the proboscis monkey as it is deemed as one of the most ancient primates alive to date with unique morphological and dietary characteristics; it is also one of the IUCN endangered species with the strong demands for immediate conservation. In this review, we provide some justifications and considerations of selecting the proboscis monkey as a model for enhancer landscape discovery. It is hoped that more conservation research and protective measures can come in time to prevent this species from extinction.

TI  - Marked Age-Dependent Prevalence of Symptomatic and Patent Infections and Complexity of Distribution of Human <i>Plasmodium</i> Species in Central Vietnam
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - In Vietnam, Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax are responsible for most malaria infections, and P. malariae and P. ovale infections are rarely reported. Nevertheless, species-specific polymerase chain reaction analysis on 2,303 blood samples collected during a cross-sectional survey conducted in a forest area of central Vietnam identified 223 (9.7%) P. falciparum, 170 (7.4%) P. vivax, 95 (4.1%) P. malariae, and 19 (0.8%) P. ovale mono-infections and 164 (7.1%) mixed infections. Of the 671 Plasmodium-positive samples by polymerase chain reaction, only 331 were detected by microscopy. Microscopy poorly diagnosed P. malariae, P. ovate, and mixed infections. Clinical and sub-clinical infections occurred in all age groups. The risk for infection and disease decreased with age, probably because of acquired partial immunity. The common occurrence of sub-patent infections seems to indicate that the malaria burden is underestimated and that diagnostic and therapeutic policies should be adapted accordingly.

TI  - Disappearance Rates of a Placebo Bait for the Small Indian Mongoose Across Different Habitats on St. Kitts
T2  - CARIBBEAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE
AB  - The small Indian mongoose (Urva aurpunctata) is a non-indigenous wildlife reservoir for rabies virus on several Caribbean islands. Oral rabies vaccination (ORV) has been suggested to prevent the spread of rabies in mongooses, but there are limited data on ORV bait survival in maritime/tropical climates. We compared disappearance rates of an egg-flavored bait block vs. a control (canned tuna) and for bait blocks, we assessed if season, habitat, and day/night would influence the disappearance rate. On the island of St. Kitts, West Indies, we baited 45 stations (n=35 bait blocks, n=10 controls) at dawn and checked them twice daily for 4 consecutive days. This procedure was repeated after a two-day period, for each combination of season (dry and wet) and habitat type (mixed grassland, littoral and dry forest). We used the Kaplan-Meier method to estimate bait survival at 12 and 36 hours after baiting. Across all sites, control baits were removed faster than bait blocks, but by 36 hours, over 90% of all baits had disappeared. For bait blocks only, the disappearance rate was higher during the dry season and in the dry forest habitat compared to the other habitats. There was no difference between diurnal and nocturnal disappearance rates. While the exact species that consumed the baits remain uncertain, we found that mongooses readily remove bait blocks, along with non-native mammals (e.g., dogs and cats) and land crabs in littoral habitats. We suggest that the bait blocks used in this study may be suitable for use as an external bait matrix for ORV baits.

TI  - Ericaceous vegetation of the Bale Mountains of Ethiopia will prevail in the face of climate change
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Climate change impacts the structure, functioning, and distribution of species and ecosystems. It will shift ecosystem boundaries, potentially affecting vulnerable ecosystems, such as tropical Africa's high mountain ecosystems, i.e., afroalpine ecosystems, and their highly susceptible uniquely adapted species. However, ecosystems along these mountains are not expected to respond similarly to the change. The ericaceous woody vegetation, located between the low-elevation broadleaf forests and high-elevation afroalpine vegetation, are anticipated to be affected differently. We hypothesize that projected climate change will result in an upward expansion and increasing dominance of ericaceous vegetation, which will negatively impact the endemic rich afroalpine ecosystems of the extensive Sanetti plateau. Hence, we modeled the impact of future climate change on the distribution of ericaceous vegetation and discussed its effect on bordering ecosystems in the Bale Mountains. We applied four familiar correlative modeling approaches: bioclim, domain, generalized linear methods, and support vector machines. We used WorldClim's bioclimatic variables as environmental predictors and two representative concentration pathways (RCPs) of the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report climate change scenarios, namely RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 for future climate projection. The results indicate increased ericaceous vegetation cover on the midaltitude of northwestern and northern parts of the massif, and the Sanetti plateau. We observed upward range expansion and increase of close ericaceous vegetation in midaltitudes, while receding from the lower range across the massif. Moreover, the current ericaceous vegetation range correlates to the temperature and precipitation trends, reaffirming the critical role of temperature and precipitation in determining species distributions along elevational gradients. The results indicate the high likelihood of considerable changes in this biodiversity hotspot in Eastern Africa.

TI  - Physiological correlates of ecological divergence along an urbanization gradient: differential tolerance to ammonia among molecular forms of the malaria mosquito <i>Anopheles gambiae</i>
T2  - BMC ECOLOGY
AB  - Background: Limitations in the ability of organisms to tolerate environmental stressors affect their fundamental ecological niche and constrain their distribution to specific habitats. Evolution of tolerance, therefore, can engender ecological niche dynamics. Forest populations of the afro-tropical malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae have been shown to adapt to historically unsuitable larval habitats polluted with decaying organic matter that are found in densely populated urban agglomerates of Cameroon. This process has resulted in niche expansion from rural to urban environments that is associated with cryptic speciation and ecological divergence of two evolutionarily significant units within this taxon, the molecular forms M and S, among which reproductive isolation is significant but still incomplete. Habitat segregation between the two forms results in a mosaic distribution of clinally parapatric patches, with the M form predominating in the centre of urban agglomerates and the S form in the surrounding rural localities. We hypothesized that development of tolerance to nitrogenous pollutants derived from the decomposition of organic matter, among which ammonia is the most toxic to aquatic organisms, may affect this pattern of distribution and process of niche expansion by the M form.
   Results: Acute toxicity bioassays indicated that populations of the two molecular forms occurring at the extremes of an urbanization gradient in Yaounde, the capital of Cameroon, differed in their response to ammonia. The regression lines best describing the dose-mortality profile differed in the scale of the explanatory variable (ammonia concentration log-transformed for the S form and linear for the M form), and in slope (steeper for the S form and shallower for the M form). These features reflected differences in the frequency distribution of individual tolerance thresholds in the two populations as assessed by probit analysis, with the M form exhibiting a greater mean and variance compared to the S form.
   Conclusions: In agreement with expectations based on the pattern of habitat partitioning and exposure to ammonia in larval habitats in Yaounde, the M form showed greater tolerance to ammonia compared to the S form. This trait may be part of the physiological machinery allowing forest populations of the M form to colonize polluted larval habitats, which is at the heart of its niche expansion in densely populated human settlements in Cameroon.

TI  - Impacts of a Fish Kill at Lake Kutubu, Papua New Guinea
T2  - PACIFIC SCIENCE
AB  - Lake Kutubu is a tropical freshwater lake that is internationally renowned for its biodiversity; 12 endemic species of fish, wetlands, and swamp forests. This study reports on a fish kill and the introduction of exotic species, and it assesses impacts on fish stocks and the artisanal -fishery. The -fish kill, which began in January 2013 and lasted for 6 months, was characterized by fish pathologies consistent with epizootic ulcerative syndrome. Sleeper gobies and gudgeons (i.e., Nilogurnda variegata Nichols, Mogurnda furva Allen & Hoese, Mogurnda kutubuensis Allen & Hoese, and Oxyeleotris fimbriata [Weber]) had more obvious signs of disease than did Hephaestus adamsoni (Trewaras), Melanotaenia lacustris Munro, and Craterocepholus lacustris Trewavas. The event coincided with an inflow of a plume of white particulates from the northeast, where hydrocarbon companies carried out extensive horizontal drilling in 2012-2013. Six months after the event, the main species caught by fishers were Cherax papuanus Holthuis (16%), H. adamsoni (55%) and M. lacustric (28%), which is different from the mix of species found in previous surveys of 1995 and 1997. The recent fish kill, as well as socioeconomic changes, substantially reduced the fish catch and fishing effort. Small-scale fish farmers began raising the genetically improved farmed tilapia strain of tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus Linnaeus) and common carp (Cyprinus carpio Linnaeus) in earthen ponds in 2009 and introduced water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes [Mart.] Solms) as a food for these fish. Heavy rains in 2010-2012 released farmed fish into the lake, and in May 2015, fishers report that the fish catch is dominated by tilapia. Improved strategies are required to educate stakeholders, assess fish stocks, and protect biodiversity by reducing anthropogenic impacts.

TI  - Risk factors for West Nile virus seropositivity of equids in Guadeloupe
T2  - PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE
AB  - In Guadeloupe, West Nile virus (WNV) activity was first observed in equids in 2002, and a high seroprevalence was found in 2003. The objective of our study was to determine individual and environmental factors associated with the risk of WNV seropositivity during 2002-2003. Fieldwork was conducted to retrospectively determine the location of equids at the time of virus circulation and to collect information regarding environmental and individual variables. Sera were collected from 369 equids out of an estimated total population of less than 500. Thirty-four environmental and individual variables were investigated. Equids had a higher risk (p < 0.001) for WNV seropositivity if they lived within the proximity "distance less than 1.5 km" of marshes or swamp forests "a large freshwater formation behind mangroves" or if they remained outside after dusk. Equids living within the proximity of ouassous shrimp (Macrobrachium rosenbergii) basins or sugar cane fields had a lower risk (p < 0.001) for WNV seropositivity. These results confirm that WNV circulation is more likely in the humid coastal areas of Guadeloupe. The identification of risk factors is useful for predicting future emergence sites of WNV in the archipelago and other Neotropical islands, and to better target sentinel surveillance in the region.

TI  - Phyllosphere fungal communities of rubber trees exhibited biogeographical patterns, but not bacteria
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Phyllosphere microbiomes play an essential role in maintaining host health and productivity. Still, the diversity patterns and the drivers for the phyllosphere microbial community of the tropical cash crop Rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis) - are poorly understood. We sampled the phyllosphere of field-grown rubber trees in South China. We examined the phyllosphere bacterial and fungal composition, diversity and main drivers of these microbes using the Illumina (R) sequencing and assembly. Fungal communities were distinctly different in different climatic regions (i.e. Xishuangbanna and Hainan Island) and climatic factors, especially mean annual temperature, and they were the main driving factors of foliar fungal communities, indicating fungal communities showed a geographical pattern. Significant differences of phyllosphere bacterial communities were detected in different habitats (i.e. endophytic and epiphytic). Most of the differences in taxa composition came from Firmicutes spp., which have been assigned as nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Since these bacteria cannot penetrate the cuticle like fungi, the abundant epiphytic Firmicutes spp. may supplement the deficiency of nitrogen acquisition. And the main factor influencing endophytic bacteria were internal factors, such as total nitrogen, total phosphorus and water content of leaves. External factors (i.e. climate) were the main driving force for epiphytic bacteria community assembly. Our work provides empirical evidence that the assembly of phyllosphere bacterial and fungal differed, which creates a precedent for preventing and controlling rubber tree diseases and pests and rubber tree yield improvement.

TI  - Effect of pulsed light on postharvest disease control-related metabolomic variation in melon (<i>Cucumis melo</i>) artificially inoculated with <i>Fusarium pallidoroseum</i>
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Pulsed light, as a postharvest technology, is an alternative to traditional fungicides, and can be used on a wide variety of fruit and vegetables for sanitization or pathogen control. In addition to these applications, other effects also are detected in vegetal cells, including changes in metabolism and secondary metabolite production, which directly affect disease control response mechanisms. This study aimed to evaluate pulsed ultraviolet light in controlling postharvest rot, caused by Fusarium pallidoroseum in `Spanish' melon, in natura, and its implications in disease control as a function of metabolomic variation to fungicidal or fungistatic effects. The dose of pulsed light (PL) that inhibited F. pallidoroseum growth in melons (Cucumis melo var. Spanish) was 9 KJ m(-2). Ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled to a quadrupole-time-of-flight (QTOF) mass analyzer identified 12 compounds based on tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) fragmentation patterns. Chemometric analysis by Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Orthogonal Partial Least Squared Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA) and corresponding S-Plot were used to evaluate the changes in fruit metabolism. PL technology provided protection against postharvest disease in melons, directly inhibiting the growth of F. pallidoroseum through the upregulation of specific fruit biomarkers such as pipecolic acid (11), saponarin (7), and orientin (3), which acted as major markers for the defense system against pathogens. PL can thus be proposed as a postharvest technology to prevent chemical fungicides and may be applied to reduce the decay of melon quality during its export and storage.

TI  - Safety and immunogenicity of a two-dose heterologous Ad26.ZEBOV and MVA-BN-Filo Ebola vaccine regimen in adults in Europe (EBOVAC2): a randomised, observer-blind, participant-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial
T2  - LANCET INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB  - Background To address the unmet medical need for an effective prophylactic vaccine against Ebola virus we assessed the safety and immunogenicity of three different two-dose heterologous vaccination regimens with a replicationdeficient adenovirus type 26 vector-based vaccine (Ad26.ZEBOV), expressing Zaire Ebola virus glycoprotein, and a non-replicating, recombinant, modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) vector-based vaccine, encoding glycoproteins from Zaire Ebola virus, Sudan virus, and Marburg virus, and nucleoprotein from the Tai Forest virus. Methods This randomised, observer-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial was done at seven hospitals in France and two research centres in the UK. Healthy adults (aged 18-65 years) with no history of Ebola vaccination were enrolled into four cohorts. Participants in cohorts I-III were randomly assigned (1:1:1) using computer-generated randomisation codes into three parallel groups (randomisation for cohorts II and III was stratified by country and age), in which participants were to receive an intramuscular injection of Ad26.ZEBOV on day 1, followed by intramuscular injection of MVA-BN-Filo at either 28 days (28-day interval group), 56 days (56-day interval group), or 84 days (84-day interval group) after the first vaccine. Within these three groups, participants in cohort II (14:1) and cohort III (10:3) were further randomly assigned to receive either Ad26.ZEBOV or placebo on day 1, followed by either MVA-BN-Filo or placebo on days 28, 56, or 84. Participants in cohort IV were randomly assigned (5:1) to receive one dose of either Ad26.ZEBOV or placebo on day 1 for vector shedding assessments. For cohorts II and III, study site personnel, sponsor personnel, and participants were masked to vaccine allocation until all participants in these cohorts had completed the post-MVA-BN-Filo vaccination visit at 6 months or had discontinued the trial, whereas cohort I was open-label. For cohort IV, study site personnel and participants were masked to vaccine allocation until all participants in this cohort had completed the post-vaccination visit at 28 days or had discontinued the trial. The primary outcome, analysed in all participants who had received at least one dose of vaccine or placebo (full analysis set), was the safety and tolerability of the three vaccination regimens, as assessed by participant-reported solicited local and systemic adverse events within 7 days of receiving both vaccines, unsolicited adverse events within 42 days of receiving the MVA-BN-Filo vaccine, and serious adverse events over 365 days of follow-up. The secondary outcome was humoral immunogenicity, as measured by the concentration of Ebola virus glycoprotein-binding antibodies at 21 days after receiving the MVA-BN-Filo vaccine. The secondary outcome was assessed in the per-protocol analysis set. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02416453, and EudraCT, 2015-000596-27. Findings Between June 23, 2015, and April 27, 2016, 423 participants were enrolled: 408 in cohorts I-III were randomly assigned to the 28-day interval group (123 to receive Ad26.ZEBOV and MVA-BN-Filo, and 13 to receive placebo), the 56-day interval group (124 to receive Ad26.ZEBOV and MVA-BN-Filo, and 13 to receive placebo), and the 84-day interval group (117 to receive Ad26.ZEBOV and MVA-BN-Filo, and 18 to receive placebo), and 15 participants in cohort IV were assigned to receive Ad26.ZEBOV and MVA-BN-Filo (n=13) or to receive placebo (n=2). 421 (99 center dot 5%) participants received at least one dose of vaccine or placebo.
   The trial was temporarily suspended after two serious neurological adverse events were reported, one of which was considered as possibly related to vaccination, and perprotocol vaccination was disrupted for some participants. Vaccinations were generally well tolerated. Mild or moderate local adverse events (mostly pain) were reported after 206 (62%) of 332 Ad26.ZEBOV vaccinations, 136 (58%) of 236 MVA-BN-Filo vaccinations, and 11 (15%) of 72 placebo injections. Systemic adverse events were reported after 255 (77%) Ad26.ZEBOV vaccinations, 116 (49%) MVA-BN-Filo vaccinations, and 33 (46%) placebo injections, and included mostly mild or moderate fatigue, headache, or myalgia. Unsolicited adverse events occurred after 115 (35%) of 332 Ad26.ZEBOV vaccinations, 81 (34%) of 236 MVA-BN-Filo vaccinations, and 24 (33%) of 72 placebo injections. At 21 days after receiving the MVA-BN-Filo vaccine, geometric mean concentrations of Ebola virus glycoproteinbinding antibodies were 4627 ELISA units (EU)/mL (95% CI 3649-5867) in the 28-day interval group, 10 131 EU/mL (8554-11 999) in the 56-day interval group, and 11 312 mL (9072-14106) in the 84-day interval group, with antibody concentrations persisting at 1149-1205 EU/mL up to day 365.
   Interpretation The two-dose heterologous regimen with Ad26.ZEBOV and MVA-BN-Filo was safe, well tolerated, and immunogenic, with humoral and cellular immune responses persisting for 1 year after vaccination. Taken together, these data support the intended prophylactic indication for the vaccine regimen.

TI  - Patterns of infection with Laguna Negra virus in wild populations of <i>Calomys laucha</i> in the central Paraguayan chaco
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - In 1995, an outbreak of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occurred in the central Paraguayan chaco. The primary reservoir of the virus, Laguna Negra virus, was identified as the vesper mouse, Calomys laucha. Over a 15-month period, we collected 1,090 small mammals at 12 locations representing 4 habitats common in the central Paraguayan chaco. Calomys laucha was common in agricultural habitats and uncommon in the native forest habitat. Populations of C laucha were greater during the dry season months and declined during the wet season. A total of 643 small mammals were tested for antibodies cross-reactive to Sin Nombre virus. All of the antibody-positive animals were C. laucha (crude antibody prevalence ratio 12.1% [25 of 206]). Antibody prevalence ratio increased with body size and was more common among male (18%; n = 115) than among female (4%; n = 96) vesper mice. Antibody prevalence ratio was highest among animals from cropland habitats (18% n = 72), followed by thorn scrub (13%; n = 46) and pastureland (7%; n = 81) and may be positively correlated to the proportion of C. laucha in the small mammal community. These data suggest that community-level dynamics, in addition to population-level dynamics, may be involved in the transmission of the virus through natural Populations of vesper mice.

TI  - Primate research and conservation in northern Argentina: the field station Corrientes (Estacion Biologica de Usos Multiples - EBCo)
T2  - TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE
AB  - In Argentina two (Alouatta guariba and Aotus Azarai) out of five species of non-human primates are endangered (Alouatta caraya, Cebus nigritus, and Cebus paraguayanus). However, most of the forests these species inhabit are under continuous anthropogenic alteration and many are not protected. The Estacion Biologica de Usos Multiples de Corrientes (EBCo) is an academic and research institution established in 2001, and its main goals are to ensure the protection of plant and animal species living in the province of Corrientes, northern Argentina, and to develop environmental education in the area surrounding the station. We present a short review of the history of the EBCO, its goals, research, and conservation projects. The main research projects are related to the study of demography, ecology, and behavior of primates in northern Argentina and to the study of ecosystem health aimed at identifying risk factors for disease transmission. Conservation-oriented activities are aimed at improving the ability of conservationists and policy-makers regarding timber exploitation, wildlife conservation, and human health.

TI  - IDENTIFICATION OF ANTHROPOGENIC IMPACT ON NATURAL HABITATS BY ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE QUANTIFICATION IN TWO NEOTROPICAL WILD CATS AND THEIR GEOSPATIAL ANALYSIS
T2  - JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE DISEASES
AB  - Human activities such as habitat degradation and fragmentation threaten biodiversity in Neotropical areas. This work proposes an analytical methodology to identify natural areas in Central America with anthropogenic impact, analyzing the presence of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) in accordance with their theoretical relationship with human-related activities. Sixteen ARGs were quantified in feces of different individuals of 13 jaguars (Panthera onca) and 13 pumas (Puma concolor) in three conservation areas in Costa Rica by real-time PCR. At least one ARG was detected in all samples. Of the ARGs encoding tetracycline resistance, the most frequent were tetQ and tetY (85% and 69%, respectively). The sulfonamides (sulI and sulII; 69% each), phenicols (catI and catII; 19% and 54%, respectively), and quinolones (qnrS; 12%) were also detected. The presence of human settlements, livestock farms (pigs, cattle, and poultry), roads, human health centers, flood zones, and rivers were identified within each area to generate an index of human activity. We found no difference between the presence of ARG by roads, agricultural activities, and human settlements (P>0.05). However, tetW showed higher percentages with porcine and bovine farms; both tetY and tetW were more frequent in jaguars than in pumas. Of concern is that many of the most contaminated samples were taken from national parks, such as Braulio Carrillo and Tortuguero, where animals should not have direct contact with humans.

TI  - Translational Venomics: Third-Generation Antivenomics of Anti-Siamese Russell's Viper, <i>Daboia siamensis</i>, Antivenom Manufactured in Taiwan CDC's Vaccine Center
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE
AB  - The venom proteome of Siamese Russell's viper from Taiwan, alongside complementary in vivo lethality neutralization assay and in vitro third-generation antivenomics assessment of the preclinical efficacy of the homologous antivenom manufactured in Taiwan CDC's Vaccine Center, are here reported. Taiwanese Russell's viper venom proteome comprised 25 distinct gene products, with the heterodimeric PLA(2) viperotoxin-F representing the most abundant toxin (47.5% of total venom proteome). Coagulation FV-activating serine proteinase (RVV-V, 14%), the PIV-SVMP activator of FX (RVV-FX, 8.5%), and less abundant toxins from nine protein families, make up its venom proteome. Venom composition-pathology correlations of D. siamensis envenomings in Taiwan are discussed. The lethal effect of Taiwanese D. siamensis venom was 0.47 mg/g mouse. Antivenomics-guided assessment of the toxin recognition landscape of the Taiwanese Russell's viper antivenom, in conjunction with complementary in vivo neutralization analysis, informed the antivenom's maximal toxin immunorecognition ability (14 mg total venom proteins/vial), neutralization capacity (6.5 mg venom/vial), and relative content of lethality neutralizing antibodies (46.5% of the toxin-binding F(ab')(2) antibodies). The antivenomics analysis also revealed suboptimal aspects of the CDC-Taiwan antivenom. Strategies to improve them are suggested.

TI  - Generation of oxidative stress and induction of apoptotic like events in curcumin and thymoquinone treated adult <i>Fasciola gigantica</i> worms
T2  - EXPERIMENTAL PARASITOLOGY
AB  - Fasciolosis is a neglected tropical disease caused by the liver fluke Fasciola gigantica. The absence of successful vaccine and emerging resistance in flukes against the drug of choice, triclabendazole, has necessitated the search for alternatives including phyto-therapeutic approaches. Curcumin and thymoquinone, the active ingredients of Curcuma longa and Nigella sativa plants respectively, were first screened for their binding affinity with Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) molecule through in silico molecular docking followed by in vitro treatment of worms with varying concentrations of the test compounds.
   The in silico molecular docking of curcumin and thymoquinone with sigma GST revealed strong hydrogen bonding as well as hydrophobic interactions with high fitness scores but showing inter-specific differences. The in vitro treatment of F. gigantica worms with both curcumin and thymoquinone resulted in a significant increase in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) whereas the level of reduced glutathione, a primary redox regulator, was found to be significantly decreased (p < 0.05). The two compounds not only inhibited the GST activity, which is an important detoxification enzyme and also a key drug/vaccine target for the control of fasciolosis but also significantly inhibited the activity of antioxidant enzymes glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase that are vital in maintenance of redox homeostasis. The immunohistochemistry performed using anti sigma GST polyclonal antibodies revealed that both the compounds used in the present study significantly reduced immunofluorescence in the vitellaria, developing eggs present in the ovary and the intestinal caecae indicating inhibition of GST enzyme in these regions of the worms. Further, following treatment with curcumin and thymoquinone, chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation was also observed in F. gigantica worms.
   In conclusion, both curcumin and thymoquinone generated oxidative stress in the worms by production of ROS and significantly inhibiting their antioxidant and detoxification ability. The oxidative stress along with induction of apoptotic like events would compromise the survival ability of worms within the host. However, further studies are required to establish their anthelmintic potential alone and in combination with the commonly used anthelmintic drugs under in vivo conditions.

TI  - Parasitological evaluation of Ro 15-9268, a 9-acridanone-hydrazone derivative against <i>Schistosoma mansoni</i> in mice, and observations on changes in serum enzyme levels
T2  - PARASITOLOGY RESEARCH
AB  - Schistosoma mansoni is one of the major causes of schistosomiasis prevalent in tropical and subtropical areas, especially in poor communities. It is estimated that at least 90 % of those requiring treatment for schistosomiasis live in Africa. The primary control strategy employed for schistosomiasis is mass drug administration (MDA).The aim is to reduce disease through treatments with a single lower dose of Ro 15-9268 as a new antischistosomal drug. In the present search, the efficacy of Ro 15-9268 was studied in mice using a dose of 12.5 mg/kg of body weight (b.wt.) against an Egyptian strain of S. mansoni. This was carried out at 2 days and 3, 4, and 6 weeks post-cercarial exposure of mice. The criteria used were the worm load, oogram pattern and number of ova in the liver and intestine, hepatic enzyme activity, and liver histopathology. The tested agent has led to a significant reduction in worm burden (89.80 %) in liver and portomesenteric veins concurrent with a hepatic shift at the second week posttreatment followed by a complete disappearance of worms, 4 weeks postmedication. The oogram of infected animals treated revealed an increased number of dead ova 2 days posttreatment and complete absence of immature and mature ova 2 weeks later. The hepatic and intestinal egg counts significantly declined by about 96 and 98 %, respectively, 6 weeks after treatment, and the fecal egg count completely disappeared from stool 4 weeks after medication. The hepatic histopathological changes were improved, ova were markedly degenerated, and worms showed fragmentation and degeneration after drug administration. In conclusion, when Ro 15-9268 was administered to mice infected with the Egyptian strain of S. mansoni, at a low dose level (12.5 mg/kg b.wt.), encouraging results were obtained. The drug showed high efficacy against schistosomal worms as well as histopathological inflammatory changes.

TI  - Antileishmanial Activity of Semisynthetic Lupane Triterpenoids Betulin and Betulinic Acid Derivatives: Synergistic Effects with Miltefosine
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease (NTDs), endemic in 88 countries, affecting more than 12 million people. The treatment consists in pentavalent antimony compounds, amphotericin B, pentamidine and miltefosine, among others. However, these current drugs are limited due to their toxicity, development of biological resistance, length of treatment and high cost. Thus, it is important to continue the search for new effective and less toxic treatments. The anti-Leishmania activity of sixteen semisynthetic lupane triterpenoids derivatives of betulin (BT01 to BT09) and betulinic acid (AB10 to AB16) were evaluated. Drug interactions between the active compounds and one current antileishmanial drug, miltefosine, were assessed using the fixed ratio isobologram method. In addition, effects on the cell cycle, apoptosis/necrosis events, morphology and DNA integrity were studied. The derivatives BT06 (3 beta-Hydroxy-(20R)-lupan-29-oxo-28-yl-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate) and AB13 (28-(1H-imidazole-1-yl)-3,28-dioxo-lup-1,20(29)-dien-2-yl-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate) were found to be the most active, with IC50 values of 50.8 mu M and 25.8 mu M, respectively. Interactions between these two compounds and miltefosine were classified as synergistic, with the most effective association being between AB13 and miltefosine, where decreases of IC50 values to 6 mM were observed, similar to the miltefosine activity alone. AB13 induced significant morphological changes, while both derivatives produced anti-proliferative activity through cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase. Neither of these derivatives induced significant apoptosis/necrosis, as indicated by phosphatidylserine externalization and DNA fragmentation assays. In addition, neither of the derivatives induced death in macrophage cell lines. Thus, they do not present any potential risk of toxicity for the host cells. This study has identified the betulin derivative BT06 and the betulinic acid derivative AB13 as promising molecules in the development of new alternative therapies for leishmaniasis, including those involving combined-therapy with miltefosine.

TI  - Parasite species variation and impact of spatial displacement of the population on cutaneous leishmaniasis in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
T2  - TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Background: Cutaneous leishmaniasis results from complex interactions between human beings, vectors and the environment. Parasitic species differ in epidemiological and geographical contexts.
   Methods: We studied a retrospective cohort of 696 patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis treated at a reference centre in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, between 2000 and 2015. We analysed displacements due to work, leisure and migrations with identification of Leishmania species.
   Results: The geographic distribution of autochthonous cases showed that >95% of infections occurred in urban areas. In the state of Rio de Janeiro, most cases were concentrated in the cities surrounding forest parks and nature conservation areas. The same applies to the city of Rio de Janeiro, where these infections occurred in the neighbourhoods surrounding some mountain and forest areas. The non-displacement group included 575 (82.6%) patients and the displacement group included 121 (17.4%) patients. Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis predominated in both groups. Other species were found in the displacement group.
   Conclusions: The disordered urbanization of the state of Rio de Janeiro in recent decades has created conditions for the emergence of urban foci of transmission close to forest areas. Changes in the environment, movement of infected individuals and adaptation of sandflies may have contributed to this.

TI  - Biomass microwave pyrolysis characterization by machine learning for sustainable rural biorefineries
T2  - RENEWABLE ENERGY
AB  - Microwave heating is a promising solution to overcome the shortcomings of conventional heating in biomass pyrolysis. Nevertheless, biomass microwave pyrolysis is a complex thermochemical process governed by several endogenous and exogenous parameters. Modeling such a complicated process is challenging due to the need for many experimental measurements. Machine learning can effectively cope with the time and cost constraints of experiments. Hence, this study uses machine learning to model the quantity and quality of products (biochar, bio-oil, and syngas) that evolve in biomass microwave pyrolysis. An inclusive dataset encompassing different biomass types, microwave absorbers, and reaction conditions is selected from the literature and subjected to data mining. Three machine learning models (support vector regressor, random forest regressor, and gradient boost regressor) are used to model the process based on 14 descriptors. The gradient boost regressor model provides better prediction performance (R2 > 0.822, RMSE <12.38, and RRMSE <0.765) than the other models. SHAP analysis generally reveals the significance of operating temperature, microwave power, and reaction time in predicting the output responses. Overall, the developed machine learning model can effectively save cost and time during biomass microwave pyrolysis while serving as a valuable tool for guiding experiments and facili-tating optimization.

TI  - Oncolytic activity of vesicular stomatitis virus in primary adult T-cell leukemia
T2  - ONCOGENE
AB  - Treatments for hematological malignancies have improved considerably over the past decade, but the growing therapeutic arsenal has not benefited adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) patients. Oncolytic viruses such as vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) have recently emerged as a potential treatment of solid tumors and leukemias in vitro and in vivo. In the current study, we investigated the ability of VSV to lyse primary human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1)- infected T-lymphocytes from patients with ATL. Ex vivo primary ATL cells were permissive for VSV and underwent rapid oncolysis in a time-dependent manner. Importantly, VSV infection showed neither viral replication nor oncolysis in HTLV1- infected, nonleukemic cells from patients with HTLV-1associated myelopathy/ tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP), and in naive CD4+ T- lymphocytes from normal individuals or in ex vivo cell samples from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Interestingly, activation of primary CD4+ T- lymphocytes with antiCD3/ CD28 monoclonal antibody, and specifically with anti-CD3, was sufficient to induce limited viral replication and oncolysis. However, at a similar level of T- cell activation, VSV replication was increased fourfold in ATL cells compared to activated CD4+ T- lymphocytes, emphasizing the concept that VSV targets genetic defects unique to tumor cells to facilitate its replication. In conclusion, our findings provide the first essential information for the development of a VSV-based treatment for ATL.

TI  - Trichoderma stromaticum and its overseas relatives
T2  - MYCOLOGICAL PROGRESS
AB  - Trichoderma stromaticum, T. rossicum and newly discovered species form a unique lineage in Trichoderma. Phylogenetic and phenotypic diversity in Trichoderma stromaticum are examined in the light of reported differences in ecological parameters and AFLP patterns. Multilocus phylogenetic analysis using 4 genes (tef1, rbp2, cal, chi18-5) did not reveal phylogenetic basis for the two reported divergent AFLP patterns or for ecological parameters; however, this analysis does indicate incomplete speciation with one supported clade derived from within T. stromaticum that corresponds to AFLP Group 2 of de Souza et al. (2006, Phytopathology 96:61-67). Trichoderma stromaticum is known only from tropical America and is typically found in association with Theobroma cacao infected with Moniliophthora perniciosa. It is reported here for the first time on pseudostromata of M. roreri in Peru. Strains of T. stromaticum also have been isolated as endophytes from stems of Theo. cacao. There are no recognized close relatives of T. stromaticum in tropical America. The closest relatives of T. stromaticum are collected in Africa and Thailand; somewhat more distantly related are T. rossicum and T. barbatum, both found in north temperate regions.

TI  - Assessing the Allometric Scaling of Vectorized Branch Lengths of Trees with Terrestrial Laser Scanning and Quantitative Structure Modeling: A Case Study in Guyana
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Allometric scaling is closely related to the morphology, function and behavior of trees, which are of great significance to the study of ecology. However, most of the traditional allometric scaling studies used the scalar attributes of trees, without considering the 3D vector mode of tree growth. In order to investigate the allometric relationships between branch lengths in 3D vector mode, in this study, an accurate and detailed quantitative structure model was used to reconstruct tree architectures from 3D point cloud data collected by terrestrial laser scanning and extract the structural parameters of each branch (length, branching level and zenith angle). The standardized major axis was used to establish and analyze the scalar and vector allometric relationships between branch lengths. Our results show that at the same branching level and using the same allometric model, the scaling exponents between the lengths of branches and the lengths of cumulative child (descendant) branches (no matter whether the lengths are in scalar or vector form) are similar among trees, and there is no significant difference between the scaling exponents of most trees. And the scaling exponents between the lengths of the horizontal components of branches and the cumulative lengths of the horizontal components of the child (descendant) branches are much larger than those between the lengths of the vertical components of branches and the cumulative lengths of vertical components of the child (descendant) branches. At different branching levels, the scaling exponents between the lengths of branches and the cumulative lengths of descendant branches tend to decrease with the increase in the branching level. The allometric models in terms of the cumulative lengths of horizontal components of the child (descendant) branches and the allometric models in terms of the cumulative lengths of child (descendant) branches have similar model accuracy and scaling exponents. The study results of allometric relationships between tree branch lengths in 3D mode are of great importance for understanding the crown morphology and the branching rule, which is helpful to further understand the growth strategies and adaptation mechanisms of trees and explain the growth and development mechanisms of trees from a physiological perspective.

TI  - SURVEY ON<i> LEPTOSPIRA </i>SPP INFECTION IN RAT SPECIES IN INDONESIA
T2  - SOUTHEAST ASIAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Rats are the main reservoir of leptospirosis and play an important role in maintaining the Leptospira life cycle in nature. This study aimed to update the data on leptospirosis-confirmed rats in various ecosystems in Indonesia. The study was conducted from 2015 to 2018 in 29 provinces in Indonesia. The rat survey was carried out for three consecutive days using live traps with roasted-coconut as the bait. The locations of the rat survey were forests near settlements, forests far settlements, non-forests near and far settlements (rice fields, fields, gardens, and others), and coastal areas near and far settlements. Leptospira spp were detected in the kidneys of rats by the PCR method. The results of the study showed that of 9,161 rats, 2,310 from 35 species are confirmed to have leptospirosis. The dominant species of rat infected with leptospirosis in Indonesia consisted of eight types: Rattus tanezumi (n= 1,623), R. tiomanicus (n= 660), R. norvegicus (n= 313), R. exulans (n=154), R. argentiventer (n=66), Bandicota indica (n=11), Mus caroli (n= 15), and M. musculus (n= 2). This study has also found that 27 other endemic rat species are confirmed positive for Leptospira: 14 species in western Indonesia, eight species in middle Indonesia, and five species in eastern Indonesia. Many rats were infected with Leptospira in ecosystems adjacent to the settlement (less than 3 kilometers) and the coastal areas.

AB  - This is a retrospective study with ecological features that describes the epidemiological pattern and geographical distribution of American tegumentary leishmaniasis cases in Campinas, Sao Paulo, between 1992 and 2003. The probable infection locations were georeferenced by means of Global Position System and spatially described using Spring 4.01 Beta software from the Brazilian National Space Research Institute. A kernel estimator was applied to identify areas of case concentration, three epidemic areas with higher case intensity were found in the municipal area in 1993/1995 and 2002/2003. Socio-demographic ( gender, age, occupation, residence time), closeness of domicile to forest, and clinical form of the disease were studied. Although socio-environment characteristics of the areas were different, epidemics profile were similar. Age, sex and occupational distribution suggest peri-domestic transmission. Proximity to forest has being a risk factor.

TI  - Challenges to subterranean termite management of multi-genera faunas in Southeast Asia and Australia
T2  - SOCIOBIOLOGY
AB  - Termites are an important group of insect pests in the tropical Asia Pacific region. Due to the high diversity of termite species in this region, it is common to find several termite pest species co-existing and infesting buildings and structures. In Malaysia and Singapore, 12 species of subterranean termites from 7 genera (Coptotermes, Macrotermes, Microtermes, Globitermes, Odontotermes, Schedorhinotermes and Microcerotermes) can be readily found in and around buildings and structures, particularly in suburbia and rural settlements. Similar observations with species in the genera Coptotermes, Microcerotermes, Macrotermes, Hypotermes and Odontotermes are also recorded in urban and rural Thailand. Termites from 3 to 6 genera (Mastotermes, Coptotermes, Schedorhinotermes, Heterotermes, Nasutitermes and Microcerotermes) may be found co-existing as structural pests in Australia with the highest number of genera in the tropical north of the country. Since the introduction of baiting in Malaysia, secondary pest species are more frequently encountered. Following elimination of the principal pest species (Coptotermes spp.) with bait, it is not uncommon to find species from other genera such as Macrotermes and Schedorhinotermes infesting the same building or structure after several months. Most of these species, particularly those belonging to genera such as Macrotermes, Globitermes and Odontotermes from the higher termite (Termitidae), however, do not respond well to baits with paper-based matrices. Options for managing multiple genera termite pest faunas in the tropics are discussed.

TI  - Disease prevalence and molecular characterisation of <i>Rigidoporus microporus</i> associated with white root rot disease of rubber tree (<i>Hevea brasiliensis</i>) in Malaysia
T2  - JOURNAL OF RUBBER RESEARCH
AB  - White root rot (WRR) disease caused by Rigidoporus microporus is a major disease affecting tropical rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis) and some agricultural crops throughout the world. In Malaysia, rubber industry is an important revenue as natural rubber for export and domestic consumption. The objectives of this study were to determine WRR disease prevalence and characterise R. microporus isolates collected from different regions in Malaysia using cultural and molecular characteristics. During July 2017 to May 2018, diseased samples showing WRR symptoms such as presence of basidiocarps and rhizomorphs in five states of Malaysia including Kedah (Baling), Kelantan (FELCRA Machang and Smallholder in Machang), Perak (Ipoh) and Selangor (Sungai Buloh and UPM Serdang), Sarawak (Bintulu) were obtained. In the field observation, all sampling areas were infected by the root rot disease. Findings revealed that field disease incidence was in the range of 5-40% based on random sampling. The collected R. microporus isolates were pure white and displayed fluffy mycelial growth when cultured on malt extract agar (MEA) medium. For molecular identification, BLASTn analysis showed 98-100% identical to existing reference sequences in the GenBank database. All 27 isolates of R. microporus were characterised based on internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and Beta-tubulin (beta-tubulin) gene sequences data. Phylogenetic tree analyses of R. microporus isolates formed two major clades, i.e. Asian and African clades. There was also no clear geographical origin structuring observed within the Asian clade. However, phylogenetic analysis of Beta-tubulin (beta-tubulin) gene region revealed distinct geographical origin amongst 27 local isolates. The outcomes of this study provide useful information to improve the existing disease control strategy, hence improving the rubber production in Malaysia.

TI  - Sandfly fauna (Diptera: Psychodidae) in a focus of American cutaneous leishmaniasis on the urban periphery of Manaus, State of Amazonas
T2  - REVISTA DA SOCIEDADE BRASILEIRA DE MEDICINA TROPICAL
AB  - From August 2001 to July 2002, sand flies were collected from the bases of trees and, using CDC and Disney traps, from areas surrounding homes and forested areas in the Sao Joao community, on the urban periphery of Manaus, State of Amazonas. 4,104 specimens belonging to four subtribes, 13 genera and 49 species of the Phlebotominae subfamily were collected. The subtribe Psychodopygina predominated, with 3,403 (83%) specimens, especially of Nyssomyia umbratilis, Nyssomyia anduzei, Trichophoromyia eurypyga, Bichromomyia olmeca nociva and Bichromomyia flaviscutellata. The occurrences of Nyssomyia umbratilis and Nyssomyia anduzei, which have been incriminated as vectors for Leishmania (Viannia) guyanensis, and of Bichromomyia flaviscutellata and Bichromomyia olmeca nociva, for Leishmania (Leishmania) amazonensis, indicate that there is a risk of infection for people living in this area. Most (98.5%) of the sand flies were caught in the forested area. Nyssomyia anduzei and Bichromomyia olmeca nociva were collected from areas surrounding homes. The richness of vector species for Leishmania in this area shows the need for constant entomological surveillance.

TI  - Occurrences of triatomines in wild and domestic environments in the municipality of Manaus, State of Amazonas
T2  - REVISTA DA SOCIEDADE BRASILEIRA DE MEDICINA TROPICAL
AB  - Analysis of the distribution of triatomines is essential for formulating control strategies for Chagas disease ill the Amazon region. In this paper, the results from trapping in wild and artificial environments in rural and urban localities in Manaus, Amazonas, are presented. Out of the 115 triatomines collected, 85 (73.9%) were of the species Rhodnius pictipes, 25 (21.7%) of Rhodnius robustus and five (4.4%) of Panstrongylus geniculatus. The rate Of natural infection by flagellates was 5.9% for Rhodnius pictipes and 8% for Rhodnius robustus. None of the specimens of Panstrongylus geniculatus were infected. All of the infected specimens were front forest fragments in the urban zone. It was found that 106 insects (92.2%) were collected from the forest environment and nine (7.8%) in households, by means of the active search. The genus Rhodnius clearly predominated in the wild environment. The specimens of Panstrongylus geniculatus (all adults) were collected inside homes. There were no signs of domestic colonization by triatomines.

T2  - TROPICAL VETERINARY MEDICINE: MOLECULAR EPIDEMIOLOGY, HEMOPARASITES AND THEIR VECTORS, AND GENERAL TOPICS
CP  - 4th Biennial Meeting of the Society-for-Tropical-Veterinary-Medicine
AB  - A parasitological and entomological survey was conducted in the Sideradougou area (south of Bobo Dioulasso, Burkina Faso) in order to identify transmission factors of African trypanosomosis. A total of 3600 tsetse flies (Glossina tachinoides, Glossina palpalis gambiensis) were captured along 120 km of linear gallery forest and half of them were dissected. PCR analysis was undertaken on parasitologically positive flies (161 G. tachinoides, 92 G. palpalis gambiensis) to characterize the different trypanosomes. All the results were integrated in a GIS (Geographical Information System). Spatial repartition of the characterized trypanosomes enabled to recognize different areas with specific patterns of infection. Relations with environmental factors are discussed.

TI  - Malaria suitability, urbanization and subnational development in sub-Saharan Africa
T2  - JOURNAL OF URBAN ECONOMICS
AB  - Using subnational data, we document that the climatic suitability for malaria falciparum transmission constitutes a first-nature characteristic that influences today's spatial distribution of urbanization and socioeconomic devel-opment in Sub-Saharan Africa. Both, levels of urbanization and development are lower in regions that exhibit a high malaria transmission potential. Evidence further indicates that the settlement behavior of the European colonizers plays an important role in explaining why urban areas are concentrated in low risk areas. Throughout, we rely on an exclusively climate-based measure of malaria falciparum transmission intensity that is independent of local prevalence rates for identification. Robustness of estimates to inclusion of climatic suitability indices for further tropical diseases, null results in placebo tests and reproduction of findings outside of Africa support the validity of our identification strategy.

TI  - Prevalence of <i>Leishmania RNA virus</i> in <i>Leishmania</i> parasites in patients with tegumentary leishmaniasis: A systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   Cutaneous leishmaniasis is caused by different protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania. Leishmania RNA virus (LRV) was identified as the first Leishmania infecting virus in 1998. Different studies showed the presence and role of the LRV in Leishmania parasites causing cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL). However, there is limited data on the pooled prevalence of LRV in Leishmania parasites causing CL. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to determine the pooled prevalence of LRV in Leishmania parasite isolates and/or lesion biopsies in patients with CL from the available literature globally.
   Methodology
   We retrieved the studies from different electronic databases. The studies were screened and identified based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. We excluded studies exclusively done in experimental animals and in vitro studies. The review was conducted in line with PRISMA guidelines. The meta-analysis was performed with Stata software version 14 with metan command. The forest plot with random-effect model was used to estimate the pooled prevalence with 95% confidence interval. Inverse variance index (I-2) was used to assess the heterogeneity among the included articles.
   Principal findings
   A total of 1215 samples from 25 studies were included. Of these, 40.1% (487/1215) were positive for LRV. The overall pooled prevalence of LRV globally was 37.22% (95% CI: 27.54% - 46.90%). The pooled prevalence of LRV in the New World (NW) and Old World (OW) regions was 34.18% and 45.77%, respectively. Leishmania guyanensis, L. braziliensis, L. major, and L. tropica were the most studied species for the detection of LRV. The prevalence of LRV from Leishmania isolates and lesion biopsies was 42.9% (349/813) and 34.3% (138/402), respectively.
   Conclusion
   This systematic study revealed that there is high prevalence of LRV in Leishmania parasites isolated from patients with CL. More comprehensive studies would be required to investigate the presence of the LRV in other Leishmania species such as L. aethiopica to fully understand the role of LRV in different clinical manifestations and disease pathology presented in CL patients.

TI  - Identifying hotspots of chimpanzee group activity from transect surveys in Tai National Park, Cote d'Ivoire
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY
AB  - Locating activity hotspots-areas of higher density, more intense use, or distinct social units-is a prerequisite for answering many questions in animal ecology. However, for many species, carrying out such research from direct observations in tropical habitat is time-consuming and unrealistic for non-habituated animals. This study aimed to locate chimpanzee home ranges from transect nest counts. For validation purposes, 233 line transects were sampled within the home ranges of four habituated social groups of chimpanzees in Tai National Park, Cote d'Ivoire. In total, 373 km of transects were surveyed over 188 days and 683 nests of chimpanzee were recorded. First, we characterized heterogeneity of nest distribution patterns, including variation in density and group size within the area. Second, we used scan statistics, a likelihood-based cluster technique to locate chimpanzee social groups and compared them with the known home range boundaries. Chimpanzee nest distribution was characterized by a positive density and group-size gradient away from the range periphery. Furthermore, nest distribution clusters corresponding to the four groups could be successfully identified, although additional clusters for, for example, low-density areas between social groups seem to be an unavoidable by-product. The approach taken can be extended to a wide spectrum of data stemming from direct observations, camera traps, acoustic or genetic sampling to derive information about structure and patchiness of wild animal populations.

TI  - <i>Plasmodium</i> infection and its association with biochemical and haematological parameters in free-living <i>Alouatta guariba clamitans</i> (Cabrera, 1940) (Primates: Atelidae) in Southern Brazil
T2  - MEMORIAS DO INSTITUTO OSWALDO CRUZ
AB  - BACKGROUND The influence of Plasmodium spp. infection in the health of Southern brown howler monkey, Alouatta guariba clamitans, the main reservoir of malaria in the Atlantic Forest, is still unknown.
   OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to investigate the positivity rate of Plasmodium infection in free-living howler monkeys in an Atlantic Forest fragment in Joinville/SC and to associate the infection with clinical, morphometrical, haematological and biochemical alterations.
   METHODS Molecular diagnosis of Plasmodium infection in the captured monkeys was performed by Nested-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (18S rRNA and coxl). Haematological and biochemical parameters were compared among infected and uninfected monkeys; clinical and morphometrical parameters were also compared.
   FINDINGS The positivity rate of Plasmodium infection was 70% among forty captured animals, the highest reported for neotropical primates. None statistical differences were detected in the clinical parameters, and morphometric measures comparing infected and uninfected groups. The main significant alteration was the higher alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels in infected compared to uninfected monkeys.
   MAIN CONCLUSIONS Therefore, Plasmodium infection in howler monkeys may causes haematological/biochemical alterations which might suggest hepatic impairment. Moreover, infection must be monitored for the eco-epidemiological surveillance of malaria in the Atlantic Forest and during primate conservation program that involves the animal movement, such as translocations.

TI  - VECTOR CONTROL IN SOME COUNTRIES OF SOUTHEAST-ASIA - COMPARING THE VECTORS AND THE STRATEGIES
T2  - ANNALS OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND PARASITOLOGY
AB  - The use of information on malaria vector behaviour in vector control is discussed in relation to the area of Southeast Asia comprising Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam. The major vectors in the region are Anopheles dirus, An. minimus, An. maculatus and An. sundaicus, of which An. dirus is the most important. Options for vector control and the biological features of mosquitoes, which would make them amenable to control by these measures, are listed. The methods with the greatest potential for controlling each of the four vector species are described. Experiences of vector control by residual spraying, insecticide-treated nets and larva control and of personal protection against the four vectors are outlined, and it is noted that choice of control strategy is often determined by epidemiological, economic and political considerations, whilst entomological observations map help to explain failures of control and to indicate alternative strategies. Future research needs include basic entomological field studies using the most appropriate indicators to detect changes related to rapidly changing environmental conditions, such as loss of forest and climate change. Further studies of the efficacy of insecticide-treated mosquito nets, with greater attention to study design, are needed before it can be assumed that they will work in Southeast Asia. At the same time, research to improve sustainable utilization of nets is important, bearing in mind that nets are not the only means to control malaria and should not drain resources from supervision and training, which improve access to diagnosis and treatment of malaria and other diseases. Research is needed to make decisions on whether vector control is appropriate in different environments, and, if so, how to carry it out in different health systems. Researchers need to play a greater role in making operational research (entomological, epidemiological, social, economic and health systems research) of good quality an integral component of implementation programmes.

TI  - Increase in the risk of snakebites incidence due to changes in humidity levels: A time series study in four municipalities of the state of Rondonia
T2  - REVISTA DA SOCIEDADE BRASILEIRA DE MEDICINA TROPICAL
AB  - Introduction: Snakebites represent a serious global public health problem, especially in tropical countries. In Brazil, the incidence of snakebites ranges from 19 to 22 thousand cases per 100000 persons annually. The state of Rondonia, in particular, has had an increasing incidence of snakebites. Methods: A retrospective cross-sectional study on snakebites was conducted from January 2007 to December 2018. Brazil's Information System for Notifiable Diseases was queried for all snakebites reported in Porto Velho, Ariquemes, Cacoal, and Vilhena. Data on land surface temperatures during the day and night, precipitation, and humidity were obtained using the Google Earth Engine. A Bayesian time series model was constructed to describe the pattern of snakebites and their relationship with climate data. Results: In total, 6326 snakebites were reported in Rondonia. Accidents were commonly caused by Bothrops sp. (n=2171, 81.80%). Snakebites most frequently occurred in rural areas (n=2271, 85.5%). Men, with a median age of 34 years (n=2101, 79.1%), were the most frequent bitten. Moderate clinical manifestation was the most common outcome of an accident (n=1101, 41.50%). There were clear seasonal patterns with respect to rainfall, humidity, and temperature. Rainfall and land surface temperature during the day or night did not increase the risk of snakebites in any city; however, changes in humidity increased the risk of snakebites in all cities. Conclusion: This study identified the population exposed to snakes and the influence of anthropic and climatic factors on the incidence of snakebites. According to climate data, changes in humidity increased the risk of snakebites.

TI  - Acceleration of viral replication and up-regulation of cytokine levels by antimalarials: Implications in malaria-endemic areas
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Antimalarial drugs are widely used in malaria endemic areas, both for chemoprophylaxis and also empirically to treat patients presenting with fever. Previously, we have reported that chloroquine enhances the severity of Semliki forest virus (SFV) and encephalomyocarditis virus infection. The studies presented herein show that a broad spectrum of antimalarial drugs augmented the replication of SFV in mice, concomitant with greater tissue damage and up-regulation of mRNA levels of various inflammatory cytokine genes, including interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), IL-1 alpha, IB-1 beta, IL-6, IL-12p40, and interferon-gamma inducing factor. Furthermore, chloroquine enhances IL-1Ra production in RAW cells in vitro. Since IL-1Ra is known to be up-regulated in a number of viral infections, we propose that a further enhancement of its expression by antimalarials may be responsible for the increased severity of viral infection in our studies. Thus, the widespread use of antimalarials in malaria-endemic areas may predispose the population to viral infections. Further studies are in progress to delineate mechanism(s) involved in cytokine up-regulation and acceleration of viral replication.

TI  - INSECTICIDE BARRIER SPRAYING FOR THE CONTROL OF SAND FLY VECTORS OF CUTANEOUS LEISHMANIASIS IN RURAL GUATEMALA
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - An initial evaluation of insecticide barrier spraying directed against sand fly vectors of cutaneous leishmaniasis was done in a nonclimax forested area with heavy undergrowth in Peten, Guatemala. A 100 m-wide swath of vegetation was sprayed once with a 1:3 mixture of cyfluthrin insecticide and a palm oil carrier using back-pack sprayers to simulate a central cantonment area in one site while another site remained as an untreated control. Prior to spraying and throughout 87 days post-treatment, sand fly populations were monitored at both sites with light traps set at ground and canopy levels at 50-m intervals radiating out from the centers of the cantonments, 150-m in the four cardinal directions. A total of 2,876 female sand flies were captured, representing 16 species. Three species, Brumptomyia galindoi, Lutzomyia panamensis, and Lu. ovallesi, comprised 70% of the total collection. The single insecticide barrier significantly reduced sand flies from reaching the cantonment area for more than 80 days, while sand fly populations outside the treated cantonment and in the untreated (control) cantonment remained high (52 sand flies in the treated cantonment versus 235 sand flies in the untreated cantonment).

TI  - Widespread Occurrence of <i>Bd</i> in French Guiana, South America
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - The amphibian chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) is a purported agent of decline and extinction of many amphibian populations worldwide. Its occurrence remains poorly documented in many tropical regions, including the Guiana Shield, despite the area's high amphibian diversity. We conducted a comprehensive assessment of Bd in French Guiana in order to (1) determine its geographical distribution, (2) test variation of Bd prevalence among species in French Guiana and compare it to earlier reported values in other South American anuran species (http://www.bd-maps.net; 123 species from 15 genera) to define sentinel species for future work, (3) track changes in prevalence through time and (4) determine if Bd presence had a negative effect on one selected species. We tested the presence of Bd in 14 species at 11 sites for a total of 1053 samples (306 in 2009 and 747 in 2012). At least one Bd-positive individual was found at eight out of 11 sites, suggesting a wide distribution of Bd in French Guiana. The pathogen was not uniformly distributed among the studied amphibian hosts, with Dendrobatidae species displaying the highest prevalence (12.4%) as compared to Bufonidae (2.6%) and Hylidae (1.5%). In contrast to earlier reported values, we found highest prevalence for three Dendrobatidae species and two of them displayed an increase in Bd prevalence from 2009 to 2012. Those three species might be the sentinel species of choice for French Guiana. For Dendrobates tinctorius, of key conservation value in the Guiana Shield, smaller female individuals were more likely to be infected, suggesting either that frogs can outgrow their chytrid infections or that the disease induces developmental stress limiting growth. Generally, our study supports the idea that Bd is more widespread than previously thought and occurs at remote places in the lowland forest of the Guiana shield.

TI  - <i>Sophora tomentosa</i> and <i>Crotalaria vitellina</i> (Fabaceae): reproductive biology and interactions with bees in the restinga of Ubatuba, Sao Paulo
T2  - BIOTA NEOTROPICA
AB  - The study of plant-pollinator interactions is a major tool for conservation biology of fragmented habitats like the Atlantic Rain Forest and for the study of evolutionary traits that rule these interactions. Information on reproductive biology and floral visitor interactions of Sophora tomentosa and Crotalaria vitellina (Fabaceae) is presented in this study. Both species are common in the restinga formation of the Atlantic Rain Forest in the Nucleo Picinguaba, Parque Estadual da Serra do Mar, Ubatuba - Sao Paulo. These species occur in the same areas, the flowering period is the same for both and they have yellow flowers that offer nectar as the major reward. Both are self-compatible, although fruit and seed set depend on the pollinators. Xylocopa brasilianorum and Megachile sp.1 were pollinators of S. tomentosa, whereas C. vitellina was pollinated by both the aforementioned bees and Bombus morio, Centris labrosa and two separate species of Megachile. All these bees have long tongues and are able to reach nectar at the bottom of the nectar chamber by legitimate visits. The inflorescences of S. tomentosa received more visits (0,62 visits/inflorescence/day) than the inflorescences of C. vitellina (0,37 visits/inflorescence/day). However, the fruit set of S. tomentosa (33%) is similar to that of C. vitellina (42%) in natural conditions, probably due to different pollinator efficiency. Having shorter tongues, Trigona and Augochlora bees have no access to the nectar chamber by means of legitimate visits. Hence, the dimensions of the nectar chamber of S. tomentosa and C. vitellina act as a selective barrier to short-tongued bees, thus guaranteeing more nectar to the long-tongued visitors. These legume pollinators are very common in the restinga forest, and they act as pollen vectors of other species in this ecosystem as well. The preservation of these legume plants is important to the diversity of bees and essential to the plant community.

TI  - Disease Risk in Temperate Amphibian Populations Is Higher at Closed-Canopy Sites
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Habitat loss and chytridiomycosis (a disease caused by the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis - Bd) are major drivers of amphibian declines worldwide. Habitat loss regulates host-pathogen interactions by altering biotic and abiotic factors directly linked to both host and pathogen fitness. Therefore, studies investigating the links between natural vegetation and chytridiomycosis require integrative approaches to control for the multitude of possible interactions of biological and environmental variables in spatial epidemiology. In this study, we quantified Bd infection dynamics across a gradient of natural vegetation and microclimates, looking for causal associations between vegetation cover, multiple microclimatic variables, and pathogen prevalence and infection intensity. To minimize the effects of host diversity in our analyses, we sampled amphibian populations in the Adirondack Mountains of New York State, a region with relatively high single-host dominance. We sampled permanent ponds for anurans, focusing on populations of the habitat generalist frog Lithobates clamitans, and recorded various biotic and abiotic factors that potentially affect host-pathogen interactions: natural vegetation, canopy density, water temperature, and host population and community attributes. We screened for important explanatory variables of Bd infections and used path analyses to statistically test for the strength of cascading effects linking vegetation cover, microclimate, and Bd parameters. We found that canopy density, natural vegetation, and daily average water temperature were the best predictors of Bd. High canopy density resulted in lower water temperature, which in turn predicted higher Bd prevalence and infection intensity. Our results confirm that microclimatic shifts arising from changes in natural vegetation play an important role in Bd spatial epidemiology, with areas of closed canopy favoring Bd. Given increasing rates of anthropogenic habitat modification and the resulting declines in temperate and tropical frogs, understanding how vegetation cover and disease interact is critical for predicting Bd spread and developing appropriate management tools for wild populations.

TI  - A revision of pipistrelle-like bats (Mammalia: Chiroptera: Vespertilionidae) in East Africa with the description of new genera and species
T2  - ZOOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY
AB  - Vespertilionidae (class Mammalia) constitutes the largest family of bats, with similar to 500 described species. Nonetheless, the systematic relationships within this family are poorly known, especially among the pipistrelle-like bats of the tribes Vespertilionini and Pipistrellini. Perhaps as a result of their drab pelage and lack of obvious morphological characters, the genus and species limits of pipistrelle-like bats remain poorly resolved, particularly in Africa, where more than one-fifth of all vesper bat species occur. Further exacerbating the problem is the accelerating description of new species within these groups. In this study, we attempt to resolve the systematic relationships among the pipistrelle-like bats of sub-Saharan Africa and Madagascar and provide a more stable framework for future systematic efforts. Our systematic inferences are based on extensive genetic and morphological sampling of > 400 individuals covering all named genera and the majority of described African pipistrelle-like bat species, focusing on previously unstudied samples of East African bats. Our study corroborates previous work by identifying three African genera in Pipistrellini (Pipistrellus, Scotoecus and Vansonia), none of which is endemic to Africa. However, the situation is more complex in Vespertilionini. With broad taxonomic sampling, we confirm that the genus Neoromicia is paraphyletic, a situation that we resolve by assigning the species of Neoromicia to four genera. Neoromicia is here restricted to Neoromicia zuluensis and allied taxa. Some erstwhile Neoromicia species are transferred into an expanded Laephotis, which now includes both long-eared and short-eared forms. We also erect two new genera, one comprising a group of mostly forest-associated species (many of which have white wings) and the other for the genetically and morphologically unique banana bat. All four of these genera, as recognized here, are genetically distinct, have distinctive bacular morphologies and can be grouped by cranial morphometrics. We also demonstrate that the genus Nycticeinops, until now considered monospecific, includes both Afropipistrellus and the recently named Parahypsugo, thus representing the fifth African genus in Vespertilionini. A sixth genus, Hypsugo, is mostly extra-limital to sub-Saharan Africa. Finally, we describe three new species of pipistrelle-like bats from Kenya and Uganda, uncovered during the course of systematic bat surveys in the region. Such surveys are greatly needed across tropical Africa to uncover further bat diversity.

TI  - Isopanduratin A Isolated from <i>Boesenbergia pandurata</i> Reduces HepG2 Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cell Proliferation in Both Monolayer and Three-Dimensional Cultures
T2  - CANCER BIOLOGY AND ADVANCES IN TREATMENT
CP  - 3rd International Conference on Innovations in Cancer Research and Regenerative Medicine
AB  - Introduction Medicinal plants have been used for disease treatment throughout history, especially in parts of Asia. Vietnam is a tropical country which possesses forests with a wide diversity of plants, which have a long history of being used as alternative remedies for treatment of various diseases. In this study, we aimed to test the bioactivity of Boesenbergia pandurata (B. pandurata) plant extract-derived compounds, including Pinostropin, Pinocembrin, Alpinetin, and Isopanduratin A, on HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells.
   Method In this study, several compounds from Boesenbergia pandurata plant extract, including Pinostropin, Pinocembrin, Alpinetin, and Isopanduratin A, were used to evaluate their antitumor effects on HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells in both monolayer culture condition (2D culture) and three-dimensional culture condition (3D culture); HepG2 cell proliferation was assessed by Alamar Blue assay. The compound which had the strongest cytotoxicity was selected for further analysis by Propidium Iodide (PI) staining assay and caspase 3/7 expression assay.
   Results The cytotoxicity assay showed that Isopanduratin A had the strongest cytotoxic effect on HepG2 cells grown in both 2D culture (IC50 at 357 +/- 10 nM) and 3D culture conditions (IC50 at 744 +/- 18 nM). The PI staining of HepG2 spheroids demonstrated that Isopanduratin A was potently cytotoxic to HepG2 cells growing in spheroids (3D) and destroyed the initial shape of the spheroids. Isopanduratin A was shown to induce caspase 3/7 after 30 min of incubation at the concentration of 500 nM.
   Conclusion This study demonstrated that the compound Isopanduratin A isolated from B. pandurata extract has a strong inhibitory effect on cell growth in 2D and 3D culture conditions. Isopanduratin A also has the ability to induce apoptosis in HepG2 cells via activation of caspase 3/7. Further investigations on the mechanisms of Isopanduratin A-induced effects on HepG2 cells, and other cancer cells, are necessary.

TI  - Conservation of citrus germplasm: an international survey
T2  - XXIX INTERNATIONAL HORTICULTURAL CONGRESS ON HORTICULTURE: SUSTAINING LIVES, LIVELIHOODS AND LANDSCAPES (IHC2014): IV INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON PLANT GENETIC RESOURCES
CP  - 29th International Horticultural Congress on Horticulture - Sustaining Lives, Livelihoods and Landscapes (IHC) / 4th International Symposium on Plant Genetic Resources
AB  - Citrus is one of the major fruit crops of the world, with production in subtropical and tropical areas of six continents. Citrus originated in south eastern Asia. Many of the forests in this region where natural populations of wild citrus likely occur have been developed for agriculture. Climate change threatens to further reduce the remaining habitat of wild citrus. The spread of modern citrus cultivars to these areas is displacing local selections and landraces. Therefore conservation of citrus germplasm is a priority, as recognized by development of a global citrus germplasm network in 1997. The International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (ITPGRFA) has recognized Citrus as an Annex 1 crop, and an initial meeting in 2012 began work to establish a global conservation strategy for citrus. To characterize the current state of citrus germplasm collections, a survey of citrus genebanks was developed and distributed worldwide. Eleven germplasm collections responded to the survey. These collections vary in size, age, location in developed vs developing countries, and emphasis of the collection. Most collections are expanding, but they vary in rates of turnover of accessions, with some having high rates of loss. Most collections maintain germplasm primarily as field collections, but greenhouses, nurseries, and cryopreservation are used by some. Pest and disease problems are an economic problem for most collections and affect a wide range of accessions. Loss of accessions due to these problems affects only two collections. Relatively few collections distribute germplasm beyond the country in which they are located. Most collections report having inadequate funding, and need new trained staff to better manage citrus germplasm. We conclude that a global citrus germplasm network is needed with resources to provide stable funding to important but imperilled collections.

TI  - Micronutrients prediction via pXRF spectrometry in Brazil: Influence of weathering degree
T2  - GEODERMA REGIONAL
AB  - Management of micronutrient levels in soils must be done carefully to avoid their deficiency or toxicity to plants. The laboratory determination of micronutrient contents is time-consuming, expensive and generates chemical wastes, making it difficult for soil surveys required in precision agriculture, especially in tropical countries. While proximal sensors like portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) spectrometry have been successfully used to predict contents of soil available macronutrient, little effort has focused on micronutrients, especially involving a large dataset, soils weathering degree and a practical application of the predictions. This study aimed to use pXRF data for the prediction of available micronutrients in 1514 samples from variable soil classes (from Entisols to Oxisols) from seven Brazilian states using machine learning algorithms and to assess the influence of soil weathering degree on such prediction models. The soil samples were collected from both surface (A) and subsurface (B or C) horizons of various soil classes under several land uses, and with varying parent materials. Available B, Cu, Fe, Mn, and Zn were predicted via stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR), support vector machine (SVM), extreme gradient boosting (XGB), and random forest (RF) algorithms and subsequently validated. The best prediction models were classified according to micronutrient availability classes (categorical validation). Adequate predictions were achieved for Cu: R2 = 0.80; RPD = 2.28; Mn: 0.68; 1.76; and Zn: 0.68; 1.70. Predictions of B, Cu, Fe, Mn, and Zn availability classes yielded overall accuracy of 0.90, 0.65, 0.67, 0.73, and 0.53, respectively. Summarily, pXRF data in conjunction with prediction models can be an effective and rapid method to determine available Cu, Mn, and Zn. Soil weathering degree must be considered on such predictions as they strongly influence model accuracy.

TI  - Active surveillance of American tegumentary leishmaniasis in endemic areas in rural Bolivia
T2  - REVISTA DA SOCIEDADE BRASILEIRA DE MEDICINA TROPICAL
AB  - Introduction: American tegumentary leishmaniasis (ATL), including mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (MCL) and localized cutaneous leishmaniasis (LCL), is endemic in Bolivia. We describe the results of active surveillance of ATL from 2001 to 2006 and assess demographic data related to ATL epidemiology in the Yungas valleys. Methods: Community-based active ATL surveillance was performed by the institutions SERVIR, CARITAS, and the Health Services Department of La Paz, whose files were reviewed retrospectively. A cross-sectional survey was carried out to assess demographic data in two communities. Results: Two thousand nine hundred nine cases of ATL were detected from 2001 to 2006: 2,488 (85.5%) corresponded to LCL and 421 (14.5%) to MCL. A reduction in the proportion of mucosal cases was observed between 2001 and 2006. The proportion of MCL cases increased with age and was higher among males (15.5% versus 12.1%, p=0.018). The rate of positivity via direct observation of the parasite in dermal scrapings and in parasite cultivation was significantly higher for LCL than for MCL (p<0.001 and p=0.009, respectively). The rate of reactivity in the leishmanin skin test was higher in the group with mucosal lesions (p=0.012). The cross-sectional survey showed that 40% of the families had emigrated from the Altiplano. Conclusions: It is necessary to undertake continuous case detection of ATL in the area, where the disease presents a high rate of mucosal cases. Increasing incidence seems to be associated with immigration and continuous deforestation to expand the crop-growing areas.

TI  - Evaluation of anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities from Strychnos icaja Baillon (Loganiaceae)
T2  - JOURNAL OF COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE RESEARCH
AB  - Anti-inflammatory agents have gained an increasing demand with the rising number of indications of inflammatory mediated diseases. Medicinal plants extract treats hnology; numerous diseases mediated by inflammation and remain a potent source of new anti-inflammatory agents and antioxidants. Strychnos icaja Baillon (Loganiaceae) is a tropical shrub common of Central Africa forest. Traditional usage of the Shrub in Gabon, involve haemorrhoids, ear infections, rheumatism and diabetes treatments. The objective of the present study is to analyse the different root's extract phenolic and alkaloids content, along with the evaluation of its in vitro anti-inflammatory and antioxidants activities. Phytochemical revealed the presence of alkaloids in the roots (0.660%). St (Strychnos) dichloromethane type extract highlights polyphenol content (total phenolic: 54.21 +/- 4.87 mgEAG/g; total flavonoids: 6.98 +/- 1.27 mgEQ/g; total tannins 46.42 +/- 1.03 mg EAT/g). St aqueous extract has a very low polyphenol content with (22.28 +/- 0.50 mgEAG/g; 1.29 +/- 0.45 mgEQ/g and 17.30 +/- 0.69 mg EAT/g) according to the above arrangement. Anti-inflammatory activities by inhibition of lipoxygenase and xanthine oxidase are also significant: St total alkaloids roots 94.33 +/- 0.16 % vs 77.74 +/- 0.14 % respectively; St dichloromethane 86.61 +/- 2.83% vs 65.19 +/- 5.25 %. Inhibition of both enzymes by St aqueous extract is deficient. DPPH test shows good antiradical activity. Antioxidant activity by the FRAP test, show that St total alkaloids of the roots have a value of 5.94 +/- 0.14mmol EAA/g that is significantly close from Ascorbic acid (5.86 +/- 0.51 mmol EAA/g). The different investigations show that Strychnos icaja has a good antioxidant activity and remarkable anti-inflammatory properties.

TI  - Parthenogenetic <i>vs</i>. sexual reproduction in oribatid mite communities
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB  - The dominance of sex in Metazoa is enigmatic. Sexual species allocate resources to the production of males, while potentially facing negative effects such as the loss of well-adapted genotypes due to recombination, and exposure to diseases and predators during mating. Two major hypotheses have been put forward to explain the advantages of parthenogenetic versus sexual reproduction in animals, that is, the Red Queen hypothesis and the Tangled Bank/Structured Resource Theory of Sex. The Red Queen hypothesis assumes that antagonistic predator-prey/ parasite-host interactions favor sex. The Structured Resource Theory of Sex predicts sexual reproduction to be favored if resources are in short supply and aggregated in space. In soil, a remarkable number of invertebrates reproduce by parthenogenesis, and this pattern is most pronounced in oribatid mites (Oribatida, Acari). Oribatid mites are abundant in virtually any soil across very different habitats, and include many sexual and parthenogenetic (thelytokous) species. Thereby, they represent an ideal model group to investigate the role of sexual versus parthenogenetic reproduction across different ecosystems and habitats. Here, we compiled data on oribatid mite communities from different ecosystems and habitats across biomes, including tropical rainforests, temperate forests, grasslands, arable fields, salt marshes, bogs, caves, and deadwood. Based on the compiled dataset, we analyzed if the percentage of parthenogenetic species and the percentage of individuals of parthenogenetic species are related to total oribatid mite density, species number, and other potential driving factors of the reproductive mode including altitude and latitude. We then interpret the results in support of either the Red Queen hypothesis or the Structured Resource Theory of Sex. Overall, the data showed that low density of oribatid mites due to harsh environmental conditions is associated with high frequency of parthenogenesis supporting predictions of the Structured Resource Theory of Sex rather than the Red Queen hypothesis.

TI  - Ecological relationships of <i>Haemagogus spegazzinii</i> (Diptera: Culicidae) in a semiarid area of Brazil
T2  - REVISTA DA SOCIEDADE BRASILEIRA DE MEDICINA TROPICAL
AB  - In t reduction: Haemagogus are mosquitoes with diurnal habits that live preferentially in forest areas. In Brazil, they are considered the primary vectors of wild yellow fever. Methods: The ecological relationships between Haemagogus spegazzinii, the environment, and some of its activities in the semiarid region of Rio Grande do Norte were analyzed by collecting eggs with ovitraps, actively searching in tree holes, capturing adults in Shannon traps, and conducting an investigation for viral infections. Results: A total of 2420 eggs, 271 immature specimens (larvae and pupae), and 206 adults were collected. Egg collection depended on rainfall and relative humidity, with oviposition occurring between January and May. Larvae were found in five plant species, including Tabebuia aurea (craibeira), with 160 larvae collected. We observed shared breeding sites between Hg. spegazzinii and the following species: Aedes albopictus, Aedes terrens, Culex spp., and Toxorhvnchites theobaldi. Adults exhibited greater activity between 5 pm and 6 pm, when 191 (92.7%) specimens were captured, while only 1 (0.5%) was collected between 7 pm and 8 pm. The relationship between Hg. spegazzinii and rainfall was significant, with positive correlations with accumulated rainfall 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 days before mosquito collection. We found that the species was infected with the DENV-2 virus. Conclusions: This work contributes new information on the bioecology of Hg. spegazzinii, with data on the main reproduction periods, oviposition, breeding sites, activity times, and the relationship between the species and meteorological variables in the Caatinga of northeastern Brazil.

TI  - History, current status, and collaborative research projects for <i>Bemisia tabaci</i>
T2  - CROP PROTECTION
CP  - 21st International Congress of Entomology
AB  - Bemisia tabaci was described over 100 years ago and has since become one of the most important pests worldwide in subtropical and tropical agriculture as well as in greenhouse production systems. It adapts easily to new host plants and geographical regions and has now been reported from all global continents except Antarctica. In the last decade, international transport of plant material and people have contributed to geographical spread, B. tabaci has been recorded from more than 600 plant species and there may be many additional hosts not yet formally documented. Biotypes have been identified in different areas of the world suggesting that B. tabaci may be a species-complex undergoing evolutionary change. These biotypes may exhibit differences in viruses transmitted and transmission efficiency, rates of development, endosymbionts, host utilization, and physiological host damage. Excessive B. tabaci induced losses worldwide occur in field, vegetable and ornamental crop production. Losses occur from plant diseases caused by B. tabaci transmitted viruses, direct feeding damage, plant physiological disorders, and honeydew contamination and associated fungal growth. The number of B. tabaci-transmitted plant viruses has increased, and total yield losses of important food and industrial crops has occurred. Effective control at present is dependent on insecticides. However, this has been achieved with more selective chemistries, use of action thresholds, and resistance management. Host plant resistance and various cultural methods are also components of developing integrated management systems. National and international collaborative projects have made significant progress towards improved characterization of the whitefly problem, increased research, development of management methods, transfer of technology to the agricultural communities, and information exchange. These projects, as well as intensive education. research and extension activities form the basis for biologically and ecologically based approaches to management. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI  - Reconstructing Satellite-Based Monthly Precipitation over Northeast China Using Machine Learning Algorithms
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Attaining accurate precipitation data is critical to understanding land surface processes and global climate change. The development of satellite sensors and remote sensing technology has resulted in multi-source precipitation datasets that provide reliable estimates of precipitation over un-gauged areas. However, gaps exist over high latitude areas due to the limited spatial extent of several satellite-based precipitation products. In this study, we propose an approach for the reconstruction of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3B43 monthly precipitation data over Northeast China based on the interaction between precipitation and surface environment. Two machine learning algorithms, support vector machine (SVM) and random forests (RF), are implemented to detect possible relationships between precipitation and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), land surface temperature (LST), and digital elevation model (DEM). The relationships between precipitation and geographical location variations based on longitude and latitude are also considered in the reconstruction model. The reconstruction of monthly precipitation in the study area is conducted in two spatial resolutions (25 km and 1 km). The validation is performed using in-situ observations from eight meteorological stations within the study area. The results show that the RF algorithm is robust and not sensitive to the choice of parameters, while the training accuracy of the SVM algorithm has relatively large fluctuations depending on the parameter settings and month. The precipitation data reconstructed with RF show strong correlation with in situ observations at each station and are more accurate than that obtained using the SVM algorithm. In general, the accuracy of the estimated precipitation at 1 km resolution is slightly lower than that of data at 25 km resolution. The estimation errors are positively related to the average precipitation.

TI  - Temporal and spatial activity-associated energy partitioning in free-swimming sea snakes
T2  - FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY
AB  - 1. Partitioning energy between critical basal functions and activity-associated behaviours is a primary determinant of animal survival. Consequently, habitat selection is likely to be driven by the efficiency with which resources can be acquired from a heterogeneous energy landscape.
   2. Determining how energy partitioning is achieved across temporal and spatial scales is particularly challenging in aquatic animals due to the logistical limitations in estimating field metabolic rates (FMR) while simultaneously examining habitat choice.
   3. Here, acoustic telemetry using accelerometers alongside bimodal respirometry were used to correlate vectorial dynamic body acceleration (VeDBA) with oxygen consumption rates (VeDBA) of sea snakes (Hydrophis curtus and Hydrophis elegans) across an ecologically relevant temperature range. Subsequently, VeDBA of free-roaming snakes was used to estimate activity-associated FMR within a near-shore environment over diel, seasonal and spatial scales.
   4. Diel changes in activity explained short-term patterns in FMR, whereas seasonal changes in water temperature drove long-term patterns. Spatial analyses demonstrated that activity-associated FMR was elevated in productive seagrass and mudflat habitats, indicative of a concentration of foraging efforts.
   5. Our findings illustrate for the first time how sea snakes partition activity-associated FMR across time and space, providing an approach by which we can monitor the impacts of, and vulnerabilities to, natural and anthropogenic disturbances like warming and trawl fisheries.

TI  - Caveats to quantifying ecosystem services: Fruit abortion blurs benefits from crop pollination
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
AB  - The recent trend to place monetary values on ecosystem services has led to studies on the economic importance of pollinators for agricultural crops. Several recent studies indicate regional, long-term pollinator declines, and economic consequences have been derived from declining pollination efficiencies. However, use of pollinator services as economic incentives for conservation must consider environmental factors such as drought, pests, and diseases, which can also limit yields. Moreover, "flower excess" is a well-known reproductive strategy of plants as insurance against unpredictable, external factors that limit reproduction. With three case studies on the importance of pollination levels for amounts of harvested fruits of three tropical crops (passion fruit in Brazil, coffee in Ecuador, and cacao in Indonesia) we illustrate how reproductive strategies and environmental stress can obscure initial benefits from improved pollination. By interpreting these results with findings from evolutionary sciences, agronomy, and studies on wild-plant populations, we argue that studies on economic benefits from pollinators should include the total of ecosystem processes that (1) lead to successful pollination and (2) mobilize nutrients and improve plant quality to the extent that crop yields indeed benefit from enhanced pollinator services. Conservation incentives that use quantifications of nature's services to human welfare will benefit from approaches at the ecosystem level that take into account the broad spectrum of biological processes that limit or deliver the Service.

TI  - Occurrence of <i>Triatoma costalimai</i> (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) in different environments and climatic seasons: a field study in the Brazilian savanna
T2  - REVISTA DA SOCIEDADE BRASILEIRA DE MEDICINA TROPICAL
AB  - Introduction: Trypanosoma cruzi-infected specimens of Triatoma costalimai have been detected in domiciliary units of Central Brazil, thereby maintaining the potential risk of vectorial transmission of Chagas disease. The aim of this study was to determine the occurrence and natural infection of T. costalimai in different environments (gallery forest, dry forest and peridomicile) and climatic seasons (wet and dry), in the municipality of Mambai, State of Goias, Brazil. Methods: Triatomines were captured in October 2010 and in June 2011, employing two different methods (manual capture and mouse-baited adhesive traps). The insects were later separated by sex and nymphal stage, counted and examined parasitologically by abdominal compression and microscopic analysis of feces. Results: Triatoma costalimai was found in three environments and in the two seasons studied. Overall, capture success of 900 traps and 60 blocks of rocks inspected was 5.8% and 11.7%, respectively. The occurrence of T. costalimai was higher among rocks in the peridomicile, where 97% of the 131 specimens were captured. The proportion of nymphs (98%) was much higher than that of adults, which were only detected in peridomicile. Most (95%) insects were captured during the wet season, with predominance of early-stage nymphs. None of the 43 specimens examined were infected by trypanosomatids. Conclusions: The results indicate a greater occurrence of T. costalimai in peridomiciliary environments and during the wet season in Mambai, Goias, highlighting the synanthropic behavior of this triatomine species in one area of the Brazilian savanna and the importance of entomological surveillance.

TI  - NICHE PARTITIONING AMONG WHITE-LIPPED PECCARIES (<i>TAYASSU PECARI</i>), COLLARED PECCARIES (<i>PECARI TAJACU</i>), AND FERAL PIGS (<i>SUS SCROFA</i>)
T2  - JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY
AB  - The introduction of a species into an ecosystem with species already occupying a similar trophic level is predicted to lead to a high degree of niche overlap. The feral pig (Sits scrofa), one of the world's worst invasive species, was introduced to the Pantanal about: 200 years ago and is thought to compete with the native white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari) and collared peccary (Pecari tajacu. Resource partitioning between the 3 species was examined, including analysis of fruit items and plants in fecal samples as well as encounter rates in different habitats, to help generate hypotheses about competitive interactions among the species. Overlaps in food resources and habitat use between feral pigs and peccaries were found to be lower than expected. In fact, niche overlap was highest between the native species. Results indicate that currently, feral pigs are not. a direct threat to the native peccaries in the Study area. Differences in morphology and behavior indicate possible mechanisms of niche partitioning between the species. Feral pigs may, nevertheless, impact the wildlife community in other ways as predators of eggs, by destruction of vegetation through rooting, or by functioning as disease reservoirs. Cattle-ranching activities may favor feral pigs and the current anthropogenic changes in the landscape could lead to changes in competitive dynamics between feral pigs and native species.

TI  - Invasive termites in a changing climate: A global perspective
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB  - Termites are ubiquitous insects in tropical, subtropical, and warm temperate regions and play an important role in ecosystems. Several termite species are also significant economic pests, mainly in urban areas where they attack human-made structures, but also in natural forest habitats. Worldwide, approximately 28 termite species are considered invasive and have spread beyond their native ranges, often with significant economic consequences. We used predictive climate modeling to provide the first global risk assessment for 13 of the world's most invasive termites. We modeled the future distribution of 13 of the most serious invasive termite species, using two different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, and two projection years (2050 and 2070). Our results show that all but one termite species are expected to significantly increase in their global distribution, irrespective of the climatic scenario and year. The range shifts by species (shift vectors) revealed a complex pattern of distributional changes across latitudes rather than simple poleward expansion. Mapping of potential invasion hotspots in 2050 under the RCP 4.5 scenario revealed that the most suitable areas are located in the tropics. Substantial parts of all continents had suitable environmental conditions for more than four species simultaneously. Mapping of changes in the number of species revealed that areas that lose many species (e.g., parts of South America) are those that were previously very species-rich, contrary to regions such as Europe that were overall not among the most important invasion hotspots, but that showed a great increase in the number of potential invaders. The substantial economic and ecological damage caused by invasive termites is likely to increase in response to climate change, increased urbanization, and accelerating economic globalization, acting singly or interactively.

TI  - ASSESSMENT OF CASSAVA ROOT AND STEM ROTS IN ECOZONES OF TOGO AND EVALUATION OF THE PATHOGEN VIRULENCE
T2  - PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
AB  - Among the diseases of cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz), root and stem rots are important in different ecozones of West Africa. This study on the prevalence of cassava root and stem rot diseases was carried out in forest and wet savanna ecozones of Togo and the causing pathogens were isolated, identified and pathologically characterized. Cassava rots were found in both the ecozones, but were more frequently observed in the forest than in the wet savanna zone. A total of 39 fungal strains were isolated from diseased root and stem samples collected from cassava fields. Botryodiplodia theobromae, Fusarium sp., Sclerotium rolfsii and Pythium sp. were the fungi isolated from the rotted cassava roots and stems. B. theobromae was the most frequently isolated fungus (51.3% of the isolated root rot pathogens), followed by Fusarium sp. (33.3% of the isolates), while S. rolfsii and Pythium sp., were less frequently found. Virulence tests on cassava stem cuttings and on cassava roots of field plants revealed only B. theobromae strains extremely virulent when inoculated into stem cuttings, whereas most of the fungi were highly virulent when inoculated into both cassava stem cuttings and roots of field plants, except S. rolfsii strains, which were less virulent when inoculated into stem cuttings. A pathogenic specialization of strains for roots or stems seemed to occur.

TI  - American cutaneous leishmaniasis on the northern coastline of the State of Sao Paulo, 1993 to 2005
T2  - REVISTA DA SOCIEDADE BRASILEIRA DE MEDICINA TROPICAL
AB  - American cutaneous leishmaniasis acquired epidemic characteristics on the northern coastline of the State of Sao Paulo beginning in the 1990s. From secondary data, a descriptive study of the disease in the four municipalities making up this region over the period from 1993 to 2005 was conducted. The frequency of phlebotomine capture in the probable transmission locations was analyzed. 689 autochthonous cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis were notified, with single and grouped cases, thus determining that the spatial distribution was heterogenous. There was synchronism and cyclicity of disease manifestation, at intervals of six to eight years. All ages were affected, with slight predominance among males, without association with any specific occupation. Among the 2,758 phlebotomines captured, Nyssomyia intermedia predominated (80.4%) inside homes and in areas surrounding them. The disease presented a transmission profile inside homes and in areas surrounding them, between the urban fringe and forests, and inside forests. In such cases, transmission would be more related to enzootic foci.

TI  - An Experimental Evaluation of Cross-Vane Panel Traps for the Collection of Sylvatic Triatomines (Hemiptera: Reduviidae)
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - Due to the limited understanding of the sylvatic cycle of Chagas disease transmission, an efficient method to attract and capture sylvatic triatomines (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) is essential to monitor human exposure risk. Current collection methods for sylvatic species, though effective, are labor- and time-intensive. This study evaluated whether modified cross-vane panel traps (commonly used in forest entomology) can be used to attract and capture flying life-stages of sylvatic triatomines and whether a commercially available lure is effective in attracting sylvatic triatomines in the field. We evaluated four trap treatments in both the wet and dry seasons in central Panama: a cross-vane panel trap fitted with an ultraviolet (UV) light, a cross-vane panel trap fitted with a commercially available human-volatile lure, a cross-vane panel trap fitted with both a UV light and a human-volatile lure, and a white sheet fitted with a UV light (a standard collection method) as a control. A total of 45 adult Rhodnius pallescens Barber were captured across 10 nights of trapping representing 112 trap-nights. There was a significant overall effect of trap type on collection success; sheet traps collected more triatomines than lure traps, and there were no differences between the sheet trap and the UV trap, nor between the sheet trap and the UV + lure trap. The lure-only trap did not capture any triatomines in this study. These results indicate that cross-vane panel traps with a UV light are as effective as a sheet trap but offer the advantage of requiring less time and effort to maintain and monitor.

TI  - Spatial clustering and risk factors of malaria infections in Bata district, Equatorial Guinea
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
AB  - Background: The transmission of malaria is intense in the majority of the countries of sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in those that are located along the Equatorial strip. The present study aimed to describe the current distribution of malaria prevalence among children and its environment-related factors as well as to detect malaria spatial clusters in the district of Bata, in Equatorial Guinea.
   Methods: From June to August 2013 a representative cross-sectional survey using a multistage, stratified, clusterselected sample was carried out of children in urban and rural areas of Bata District. All children were tested for malaria using rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs). Results were linked to each household by global position system data. Two cluster analysis methods were used: hot spot analysis using the Getis-Ord Gi statistic, and the SaTScan (TM) spatial statistic estimates, based on the assumption of a Poisson distribution to detect spatial clusters. In addition, univariate associations and Poisson regression model were used to explore the association between malaria prevalence at household level with different environmental factors.
   Results: A total of 1416 children aged 2 months to 15 years living in 417 households were included in this study. Malaria prevalence by RDTs was 47.53%, being highest in the age group 6-15 years (63.24%, p < 0.001). Those children living in rural areas were there malaria risk is greater (65.81%) (p < 0.001). Malaria prevalence was higher in those houses located < 1 km from a river and < 3 km to a forest (IRR: 1.31; 95% CI 1.13-1.51 and IRR: 1.44; 95% CI 1.25-1.66, respectively). Poisson regression analysis also showed a decrease in malaria prevalence with altitude (IRR: 0.73; 95% CI 0.62-0.86). A significant cluster inland of the district, in rural areas has been found.
   Conclusions: This study reveals a high prevalence of RDT-based malaria among children in Bata district. Those households situated in inland rural areas, near to a river, a green area and/or at low altitude were a risk factor for malaria. Spatial tools can help policy makers to promote new recommendations for malaria control.

TI  - Basidyomicetes of Costa Rica.: New <i>Exobasidium</i> species (Exobasidiaceae) and records of Cryptobasidiales
T2  - REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL
AB  - Six new species in the genus Exobasidium are described: E. aequatorianum n. sp., parasitic on Vaccinium crenatum (Don) Sleumer from Ecuador where it is widely distributed; E. arctostaphyli Harkn., found on Arctostaphylos arbutoides (Lindl.) Hemsl., and on Comarostaphylos costaricensis Small in Costa Rica is redescribed; E. jamaicense n. sp., on Lyonia jamaicensis (Swartz) D. Don from Jamaica and possibly throughout the Caribbean range of the host genus; E. disterigmicola n.sp., on Disterigma humboldtii (Kl.)Nied.,from the Talamanca Range, Costa Rica and possibly, throughout the range of its host, E. sphyrospermii II. sp.,on Sphyrospermum cordifolium Bentham in Costa Rica, E. poasanum n. sp., on Cavendishia bracteata (Ri & P.-ex J. St.-Hil.) Hoer., from the Poas massif in Costa Rica. Exobasidium escalloniae Gomez & Kisimova,described from Costa Rica, is now known to occur in Ecuador on the same host, Escallonia myrtilloides L.f. Exobasidium vaccinii (Fkl.) Wor. is here reported from Vaccinium floribundum H.B.K. from various Ecuadorean localities, and E. pernettyae n. sp. is described as a parasite of Pernettya prostrata (Cav.) DC in Costa Rica. With the exception of Escallonia, of saxifragaceous affinities, all hosts belong in the Ericaceae. Exobasidium arctostaphyli is a first record for the neotropical region. With the exception of E. jamaicense, ndt seen in the wild by us, all others have been found associated with small slugs (Mollusca: Limacidae) which are suspected to be one of the vectors of the parasite. Some biogeographical considerations are presented.-The Cryptobasidiaceae Clinoconidium bullatum Syd., not collected since first described in 1925, and Clinoconidium farinosum (P Henn.) Pat., are both parasites of Lauraceae, Cinnamomum sp. and Ocotea monteverdensis Burger, respectively, and were found in the Monteverde Reserve, Costa Rica. Drepanoconis larviformis (Speg.) Speg. is reported as a parasite of Aiouea costaricensis (Mez) Kosterm. from the cloud forests of San Gerardo de Dota, Costa Rica. Clinoconidium farinosum and Drepanoconis larviformis constitute new records for Central America.

TI  - New classification of natural breeding habitats for Neotropical anophelines in the Yanomami Indian Reserve, Amazon Region, Brazil and a new larval sampling methodology
T2  - MEMORIAS DO INSTITUTO OSWALDO CRUZ
AB  - Here we present the first in a series of articles about the ecology of immature stages of anophelines in the Brazilian Yanomami area. We propose a new larval habitat classification and a new larval sampling methodology. We also report some preliminary results illustrating the applicability of the methodology based on data collected in the Brazilian Amazon rainforest in a longitudinal study of two remote Yanomami communities, Parafuri and Toototobi. In these areas, we mapped and classified 112 natural breeding habitats located in low-order river systems based on their association with river flood pulses, seasonality and exposure to sun. Our classification rendered seven types of larval habitats: lakes associated with the river, which are subdivided into oxbow lakes and nonoxbow lakes, flooded areas associated with the river, flooded areas not associated with the river, rainfall pools, small forest streams, medium forest streams and rivers. The methodology for larval sampling was based on the accurate quantification of the effective breeding area, taking into account the area of the perimeter and subtypes of microenvironments present per larval habitat type using a laser range finder and a small portable inflatable boat. The new classification and new sampling methodology proposed herein may be useful in vector control programs.

TI  - Mark-release-recapture of male <i>Aedes aegypti</i> (Diptera: Culicidae): Use of rhodamine B to estimate movement, mating and population parameters in preparation for an incompatible male program
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Rapid advances in biological and digital support systems are revolutionizing the population control of invasive disease vectors such as Aedes aegypti. Methods such as the sterile and incompatible insect techniques (SIT/IIT) rely on modified males to seek out and successfully mate with females, and in doing so outcompete the wild male population for mates. Currently, these interventions most frequently infer mating success through area-wide population surveillance and estimates of mating competitiveness are rare. Furthermore, little is known about male Ae. aegypti behaviour and biology in field settings. In preparation for a large, community scale IIT program, we undertook a series of mark- release-recapture experiments using rhodamine B to mark male Ae. aegypti sperm and measure mating interactions with females. We also developed a Spatial and Temporally Evolving Isotropic Kernel (STEIK) framework to assist researchers to estimate the movement of individuals through space and time. Results showed that similar to 40% of wild females captured daily were unmated, suggesting interventions will need to release males multiple times per week to be effective at suppressing Ae. aegypti populations. Males moved rapidly through the landscape, particularly when released during the night. Although males moved further than what is typically observed in females of the species, survival was considerably lower. These unique insights improve our understanding of mating interactions in wild Ae. aegypti populations and lay the foundation for robust suppression strategies in the future.
   Author summary Incompatible insect techniques for controlling populations of the dengue vector, Aedes aegypti, utilize the mating biology of adult male mosquitoes to achieve suppression through a sterilization process. As the study of Ae. aegypti control has typically focused on adult female mosquitoes, knowledge on male movement, survival and mating interactions in the field is lacking. Here we undertook several mark-release-recapture experiments on adult male Ae. aegypti in Innisfail, Australia, and measured important biological parameters. For the first time in large field experiments, we employed rhodamine B as a marker that when fed to adult males, identified both marked males and the wild females they mated with. We observed males moving further through the landscape, but surviving for a shorter period, than previous measurements undertaken on females in a field setting. A high proportion (similar to 40%) of unmated females suggests individuals are constantly available for mating. As such, sterile male strategies may need to release at regular intervals to achieve effective population suppression. The unique insights provided by this study will assist in designing future sterile male field interventions.

TI  - Effects of climate change on a mutualistic coastal species: Recovery from typhoon damages and risks of population erosion
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Presently, climate change has increased the frequency of extreme meteorological events such as tropical cyclones. In the western Pacific basin, these cyclones are called typhoons, and in this area, around Taiwan Island, their frequency has almost doubled since 2000. When approaching landmasses, typhoons have devastating effects on coastal vegetation. The increased frequency of these events has challenged the survival of coastal plant species and their posttyphoon recovery. In this study, a population of coastal gynodioecious Ficus pedunculosa var. mearnsii (Mearns fig) was surveyed for two years to investigate its recovery after Typhoon Morakot, which occurred in August 2009. Similar to all the Ficus species, the Mearns fig has an obligate mutualistic association with pollinating fig wasp species, which requires syconia (the closed Ficus inflorescence) to complete its life cycle. Moreover, male gynodioecious fig species produces both pollen and pollen vectors, whereas the female counterpart produces only seeds. The recovery of the Mearns fig was observed to be rapid, with the production of both leaves and syconia. The syconium: leaf ratio was greater for male trees than for female trees, indicating the importance of syconium production for the wasp survival. Pollinating wasps live for approximately 1 day; therefore, receptive syconia are crucial. Every typhoon season, few typhoons pass by the coasts where the Mearns fig grows, destroying all the leaves and syconia. In this paper, we highlight the potential diminution of the fig population that can lead to the extinction of the mutualistic pair of species. The effects of climate change on coastal species warrant wider surveys.

TI  - Potential risk sites and their relationship with dengue cases, Campinas municipality, Southeast Brazil
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Author summaryMany factors drive dengue circulation and seasonal patterns, such as environmental factors, including the urban landscape, which can provide suitable sites for the emergence and proliferation of Aedes aegypti. We aim to test if some places of interest identified by the Ministry of Health in Brazil affect dengue case distribution and the risk differently. We considered the Strategic Points (SPs) and Special Buildings (SBs) as reported by public health authorities. These are properties that can favor the proliferation of mosquitoes and favor human exposure to the dengue virus. We focused on the municipality of Campinas from 2013 to 2016. We assessed the distribution of dengue cases around these properties and the existence of a gradient in risk with increasing distance from these places using Stone's test. We found a correlation between the distance from these properties and dengue cases occurrences (for most sources investigated). Higher risk was always closer to the SPs and SBs, and the risk decreased as distance from these sources increased. Therefore, we emphasize the importance of public agents' survey work and the maintenance and improvement of the inspections already conducted in SPs/SBs properties.
   BackgroundAmong the main activities of dengue and vector control recommended by the Ministry of Health of Brazil is the inspection and monitoring of properties identified as Strategic Points (SPs) and Special Buildings (SBs). SPs are properties associated to hazard, where there is a concentration of suitable egg-laying containers for Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, while SBs have greater importance for human exposure to the dengue virus. ObjectivesTo investigate the effect of characteristics of the urban landscape on dengue incidence. Specifically, we tested if SPs and SBs affect dengue case distribution in Campinas, and if they do, if they affect the risk differently. We considered the period from 2013 to 2016. MethodsWe tested whether dengue cases were more numerous than expected in the vicinity of SPs and SBs, putative sources of risk, using the Negative Binomial models. We also tested the existence of a gradient in incidence with increasing distance to SPs and SBs by using Stone's test. ResultsThe Rate Ratios (RR) values were always higher closer to the SPs and SBs, and these values tended to decrease as distance from these sources increased. In general, RR values greater than one, which indicates a higher risk, were associated to the closest buffers from the SPs/SBs properties, until nearly 550 meters for the SPs and 650 meters for the SBs. Stone's test results indicated that for all years considered, there was a correlation between the distance from the SPs/SBs and dengue cases occurrences, except for SBs from 2016. For SPs the relationship is stronger than for SBs. DiscussionResults are coherent with other studies which found that these properties contribute to an increased risk of dengue transmission. We emphasize the importance of public agents' survey work and the importance to keep and improve the inspections in SPs/SBs recorded in Campinas.

TI  - Interventions to maximize facial cleanliness and achieve environmental improvement for trachoma elimination: A review of the grey literature
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   Efforts are underway to scale-up the facial cleanliness and environmental improvement (F&E) components of the World Health Organization's SAFE strategy for elimination of trachoma as a public health problem. Improving understanding of the F&E intervention landscape could inform advancements prior to scale-up, and lead to more effective and sustained behavior change.
   Methods/findings
   We systematically searched for relevant grey literature published from January 1965 through August 2016. Publications were eligible for review if they described interventions addressing F&E in the context of trachoma elimination programs. Subsequent to screening, we mapped attributes of F&E interventions. We then employed three behavior change frameworks to synthesize mapped data and identify potential intervention gaps. We identified 27 documents meeting inclusion criteria. With the exception of some recent programming, F&E interventions have largely focused on intermediate and distal antecedents of behavior change. Evidence from our analyses suggests many interventions are not designed to address documented determinants of improved F&E practices. No reviewed documents endorsed inclusion of intervention components related to behavioral maintenance or resilience-factors critical for sustaining improved behaviors.
   Conclusions
   If left unaddressed, identified gaps in intervention content may continue to challenge uptake and sustainability of improved F&E behaviors. Stakeholders designing and implementing trachoma elimination programs should review their F&E intervention content and delivery approaches with an eye toward improvement, including better alignment with established behavior change theories and empirical evidence. Implementation should move beyond information dissemination, and appropriately employ a variety of behavior change techniques to address more proximal influencers of change.

TI  - Fauna of phlebotomine sand flies (Diptera, Psychodidae) in areas with endemic American cutaneous leishmaniasis in the State of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ENTOMOLOGIA
AB  - Fauna of phlebotomine sand flies (Diptera, Psychodidae) in areas with endemic American cutaneous leishmaniasis in the State of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. The aim of this study was to investigate the ecological aspects of the main vectors of American cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL) in four monitoring stations situated in the municipalities of Navirai, Nova Andradina, Novo Horizonte do Sul and Rio Verde de Mato Grosso. For each monitoring station, the captures of sand flies were undertaken each month from July 2008 to June 2010 using CDC and Shannon traps. The CDC traps were installed simultaneously for three consecutive nights in three collection sites: intradomicile, peridomicile and edge of the forest. A Shannon trap was installed from dusk to 10 pm, inside the forest, one night per month. A total of 7,651 sand flies belonging to nine genera and twenty-nine species were captured. Nyssomyia neivai (52.95%), Psathyromyia hermanlenti (10.91%), Psathyromyia runoides (9.16%), Nyssomyia whitmani (7.95%), Psathyromyia aragaoi (4. 89%), Nyssomyia antunesi (3.14%) and Evandromyia bourrouli (2.20%) were the most frequent species. Approximately 65% of the sand flies were collected in the forest environment. The municipalities presented significantly different indexes of species diversity. Navirai presented the lowest species diversity index, however, it showed the highest abundance. Novo Horizonte do Sul had the highest species diversity index, but the lowest abundance (< 5%). It is noteworthy the occurrence of vector species of Leishmania in the areas studied, especially in Navirai, where Ny. neivai presented high frequencies which may explain the increased number of ACL cases in this municipality.

TI  - <i>Litomosoides</i> sp. (Filarioidea: Onchocercidae) Infection in Frugivorous Bats (<i>Artibeus</i> spp.): Pathological Features, Molecular Evidence, and Prevalence
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE
AB  - Bats can host pathogenic organisms such as viruses and fungi, but little is known about the pathogenicity of their parasites. Hemoparasites are frequently recorded in Neotropical bats, particularly Litomosoides (Filarioidea: Onchocercidae), but their pathogenic effect on bats is scarcely known. In this work, Litomosoides microfilariae were identified in four (8%) out of 51 sampled frugivorous bats belonging to three different species: Artibeus aztecus, Artibeus jamaicensis, and Artibeus lituratus, which are located in Yautepec, Morelos, Mexico. Two infected animals showed weakness, tachypnoea, and ecchymosis on their wings. In these animals, histopathology revealed microfilariae in the blood vessels of the lung, liver, and spleen. Both animals presented exudative pneumonia with congestion and concomitant edema, in addition to moderate arterial hypertrophy. Parasitemia was quantified in blood samples of the infected animals (>3000 parasites/mL). Phylogenetic analysis placed the obtained sequence inside the Litomosoides genus, reaching over 98% identity to the related species. Due to the relevance of bats in ecosystems, any new record of their parasite repertoire offers noteworthy insights into our understanding of the ecology and impact of new parasite species in bats.

TI  - EUCALYPT ALTERNATIVES TO ACACIA MANGIUM IN WET TROPICS
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL FOREST SCIENCE
AB  - Acacia mangium was planted on a large scale in the 1990s as it was thought to be the solution for afforestation in Sarawak. However, the trees are now being decimated by fungal diseases which attack its stem and its roots. The genetic variability of the species is limited and thus, there is little hope of saving the species through selection for resistance or tolerance. Hybridisation with A. auriculiformis holds some promise though, as witnessed in Vietnam. Selected hybrids show resistance to some of the diseases, grow well and can easily be propagated by vegetative means. The switch to A. crassicarpa presently holds much promise for poor and peat soils and some disease resistance, and there may be a few different acacia species still available for testing. Nevertheless, controlled hybridisation of the acacias is not easily accomplished. Except for the hybrid mentioned above, vegetative propagation is not easy, such as is with the eucalypts. The eucalypts (E. pellita, E. deglupta, E. brassiana, E. tereticornis var. tereticornis, possibly also E. leptophleba, especially Papua Island and northern Australian provenances) are a good starting point for eucalyptus cultivation in equatorial climates like Sarawak, along with the use of hybridisation and vegetative propagation. These species can form the pillar for selection, formation of landraces, hybridisation and vegetative propagation for the humid and hot equatorial climate. Eucalypts are more demanding on soil quality, but easy to hybridise and amenable to vegetative propagation and with a wide array of wood qualities. Their gene pools and the clones obtained can be widened with genetic inputs of a variety of other species being bred into eucalypts in sub-tropical regions where they are extremely successful. A wide genetic base and quick replacement for more productive and resistant clones form one of the bases for successful short-rotation forestry. About 25 additional species are suitable for hybridisation. Possibilities within the genus Corymbia are briefly discussed in this paper.

TI  - CERATOCYSTIS WILT OF ACACIA MANGIUM IN SABAH: UNDERSTANDING THE DISEASE AND REDUCING ITS IMPACT
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL FOREST SCIENCE
AB  - A canker and wilt disease caused by the fungal pathogen Ceratocystis manginecans has devastated Acacia mangium plantations in Southeast Asia. The disease develops when the pathogen enters wounds of the stems of the trees. The wounds are caused by wind damage, branch pruning, animal feeding and borer infestation. Various insects, including nitidulid beetles and scolytine wood borers, have been shown to be closely associated with the development of this disease, although a vector relationship has not been established. The disease has never been found on the roots of trees and isolations from soil in heavily infested plantations have failed to yield cultures of C. manginecans. Research was initiated in 2012 has focused on developing an inoculation protocol to select A. mangium with tolerance to infection by C. manginecans. In order to achieve this, an isolate of the pathogen identified using DNA sequencing technology and having a high level of aggressiveness was selected. Preliminary trials showed that inoculations need to be conducted on established trees with welldeveloped vascular tissues, ideally one-year-old, and that tests on small plants are meaningless. The ideal inoculation technique involved inserting a single plug of C. manginecans mycelia into wounds made on the stems of one-year-old trees and monitoring the results during the subsequent 12 months, at which time most trees would have died. Over a period of approximately eight years, inoculations were performed on 6 000 such trees representing 140 A. mangium families. The small number of surviving trees was retained by grafting and subsequent vegetative propagation. Re-inoculation of these putatively tolerant trees has led to the identification of approximately 50 clones having high levels of disease tolerance. These trees can now be used to establish seed orchards and for hybridisation with Acacia auriculiformis, which is known to be substantially less susceptible to C. manginecans than A. mangium. The results suggest that it may be possible to pursue plantation forestry utilising A. mangium, most likely as a hybrid partner with A. auriculiformis.

TI  - Sand Flies (Diptera: Psychodidae) in a Cerrado Area of the Maranhao State, Brazil
T2  - NEOTROPICAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - The present paper aims to increase the knowledge on the sand fly fauna in the cerrado areas of Maranhao state in urban, rural and forest environments. The research was carried out from October 2007 to September 2008, between 18:00h and 06: 00h, in the municipality of Chapadinha, northeast Maranhao. For insect sampling, CDC light traps were set up in peridomicile and domicile areas of urban and rural zones as well as in Cerrado and Gallery forests. The total of 1,401 specimens belonging to 17 species were sampled, all within the genus Lutzomyia. Lutzomyia longipalpis (Lutz & Neiva) (52.5%), Lu. evandroi (Costa Lima & Antunes) (18.3%), Lu. whitmani (Antunes & Coutinho) (12.1%), Lu. lenti (Mangabeira) (4.7%) and Lu. termitophila (Martins, Falcao & Silva) (4.0%) were the most frequently collected. From an epidemiological viewpoint, five from all of the collected species are vectors of leishmaniasis: Lu. longipalpis, Lu. whitmani, Lu. flaviscutellata (Mangabeira), Lu. gomezi (Nitzulescu) and Lu. chagasi (Costa Lima). Lutzomyia chagasi was registered for the first time in Maranhao state and Lu. saulensis (Floch & Abonnenc), Lu. monstruosa (Floch & Abonnenc) and Lu. gomezi were found for the first time in the eastern part of the state, since they had been reported only in the Amazonian region of Maranhao. Regarding to the studied environments, the urban chicken house had the highest number of specimens collected (801), while the Gallery Forest was the most diverse (15 species). This study demonstrates that the northeast cerrado exhibits a mixed sand fly fauna characterized by an extremely important species vectors assortment involved in the epidemiological cycle of leishmaniasis in Maranhao state.

TI  - Characterization of host-fungus interactions among wood decay fungi associated with <i>Khaya senegalensis</i> (Desr.) A. Juss (Meliaceae) in Singapore
T2  - FOREST PATHOLOGY
AB  - Tree pruning creates wounds that are amenable for wood decay fungi colonization. To characterize the dynamic host-fungus interactions at this location in Senegal mahogany (Khaya senegalensis), in vitro and in vivo pathogenicity tests were conducted with wood decay fungi associated with this tropical tree species. Fomitiporella caryophylii, Hymenochaete murina and Phellinus noxius isolates were included in this experiment following their frequent isolation from Senegal mahogany pruning wounds. The evaluated isolates demonstrated unique host interactions in laboratory tests that suggest equally divergent prognoses for living Senegal mahoganies affected by these fungi. Although all evaluated fungal isolates successfully breached naturally induced reaction zones, P. noxius alone caused significant mass loss to incubated wood blocks. In addition, P. noxius caused extensive wood decay after inoculation in living hosts, successfully illustrating Koch's postulates for this host-fungus relationship. The wood decay ability, invasiveness and facultative parasitism demonstrated by P. noxius suggest its dominant role in wood decay columns below pruning wounds on living Senegal mahoganies. These results highlight the importance of characterizing specific host-fungus interactions and their implications for wood decay severity below pruning wounds in living trees.

TI  - The role of body size and shape in understanding competitive interactions within a community of Neotropical dung beetles
T2  - JOURNAL OF INSECT SCIENCE
AB  - Geometric morphometrics is helpful for understanding how body size and body shape influence the strength of inter-specific competitive interactions in a community. Dung beetles, characterized by their use of decomposing organic material, provide a useful model for understanding the structuring of ecological communities and the role of competition based on their size and morphology. The relationship between body size and shape in a dung beetle community from the Atlantic Forest in Serra do Japi, Brazil was analyzed for 39 species. Fifteen anatomical landmarks on three-dimensional Cartesian coordinates were used to describe both the shape and the size of the body of each species on the basis of the centroid located along homologous points in all of the species. The first vector of a principal components analysis explained 38.5% of the morphological variation among species, and represents a gradient of body shape from elongated, flattened bodies with narrow abdomen to rounded or convex bodies. The second component explained 17.8% of the remaining variation in body shape, which goes from species with an abdomen that is larger than the elytra to species with constricted abdomens and large elytra. The relationship between body size and shape was analyzed separately for diurnal and nocturnal species. In both guilds not only were there differences in body size, but also in body shape, suggesting a reduction in their level of competition.

TI  - Diversity in the invasive cacao pathogen <i>Moniliophthora roreri</i> is shaped by agriculture
T2  - PLANT PATHOLOGY
AB  - Frosty pod rot disease of cacao (FPR), caused by the fungus Moniliophthora roreri, has severely impacted the production of cocoa in Latin America since its discovery. Prior to the 1950s, FPR was known only from Colombia and Ecuador. However, beginning in the 1970s, its geographical range has dramatically expanded throughout most of the cacao-producing regions of the Americas. The origin of the pathogen remains unknown. In this study, we evaluated the genetic diversity of M. roreri from areas spanning, as much as possible, its current geographical range using simple-sequence repeat markers and a publicly available single-nucleotide polymorphism data set. Two hotspots of genetic diversity were found: coastal Ecuador and the inter-Andean Magdalena Valley of Colombia, neither of which correspond to the Amazonian origin of the host. However, both areas were early centres of intense cultivation of cacao. Our results indicate that M. roreri was introduced into both areas from its centre of origin, where intensive cacao cultivation probably led to the increase of inoculum and further dissemination of the disease. Current invasions can be traced to two genotypes responsible for all known instances of the pathogen in Central America, the Caribbean, Peru and Bolivia. We also report for the first time M. roreri in Maynas (Peruvian Amazon), which is probably the result of a recent introduction from Colombia.

TI  - Synanthropy of Sarcophagidae (Diptera) in southeastern Brazil
T2  - NEOTROPICAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - Sarcophagidae (Diptera) are potential vectors of several pathogens. They are also very important in forensic entomology, providing basic information on the circumstances of death. The objective of this study was to determine the synanthropic index of adult Sarcophagidae collected in Rio Claro, state of So Paulo, southeastern Brazil. Sampling occurred between September 2009 and August 2010. Traps baited with sardines, beef liver, or minced meat were set for five consecutive days per month in three distinct ecological areas representing urban, rural, and forest environments. A total of 440 specimens of sarcophagids were collected. The most abundant species was Peckia (Sarcodexia) lambens (Wiedemann), followed by Oxysarcodexia thornax (Walker), Peckia (Euboettcheria) collusor (Curran & Walley), Peckia (Euboettcheria) sp., and Peckia (Pattonella) intermutans (Walker). The only species with positive synanthropic index values were O. thornax and P. (S.) lambens, which demonstrated a greater preference for inhabited areas. Peckia (Euboettcheria) florencioi (Prado & Fonseca), P. (P.) intermutans, and Peckia (Euboettcheria) australis (Townsend) were only found in the forested area, which demonstrates their importance in forensic entomology because of their preference for a particular type of environment. The greatest number of sarcophagids was found in the forest environment; however, only the forest and rural areas were significantly different in Sarcophagidae abundance.

TI  - Tick-borne pathogens in neotropical animals in Trinidad, West Indies
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
AB  - Background: Ticks are important vectors of many pathogens that have contributed to the morbidity and mortality of humans and domestic animals worldwide. Wildlife species have also been implicated as reservoir hosts of a variety of tick-borne pathogens. The objective of this study was to determine which tick-transmitted pathogens were present in the animals harvested from the forest in Trinidad for human consumption.
   Methods: Thin blood smears from 43 neotropical animals were examined microscopically for tick-borne pathogens. Additionally, DNA extraction and PCR amplification of the 16S rRNA gene were used for amplification of Anaplasma and Ehrlichia while the gltA gene was used for Bartonella, and Rickettsia spp. and the 18S rRNA gene for Babesia, Hepatozoon and Theileria species.
   Results: Pathogen DNA was amplified from four samples (a deer, collared peccary and two agoutis). Sequencing of the amplified products from the deer and collared peccary revealed 99.8% homology to Anaplasma bovis and 98.8% homology to Ehrlichia canis, respectively. Sequences from two agoutis revealed 90.4% homology to Theileria spp. DNA of Hepatozoon spp., Bartonella spp. Babesia spp. and Rickettsia spp. was not detected in any of the screened samples. An incidental finding in this study was the presence of bacteria in the blood of animals.
   Conclusions: The results indicate that the DNA of tick-transmitted pathogens is present at a frequency of about 10% in the study population and suggests that neotropical mammals may serve as a source for the potential transmission of tick-borne pathogens to domestic animals and humans. In addition, physicians and hunters should be aware of the symptoms associated with zoonotic tick-borne pathogens so that these infections can be recognised, diagnosed and treated promptly. Bacteria present in carcasses can pose a food safety hazard and hunters should be trained in proper harvesting and handling of carcasses.

TI  - Malaria Ecotypes and Stratification
T2  - ADVANCES IN PARASITOLOGY, VOL 78
AB  - To deal with the variability of malaria, control programmes need to stratify their malaria problem into a number of smaller units. Such stratification may be based on the epidemiology of malaria or on its determinants such as ecology. An ecotype classification was developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) around 1990, and it is time to assess its usefulness for current malaria control as well as for malaria modelling on the basis of published research. Journal and grey literature was searched for articles on malaria or Anopheles combined with ecology or stratification.
   It was found that all malaria in the world today could be assigned to one or more of the following ecotypes: savanna, plains and valleys; forest and forest fringe; foothill; mountain fringe and northern and southern fringes; desert fringe; coastal and urban. However, some areas are in transitional or mixed zones; furthermore, the implications of any ecotype depend on the biogeographical region, sometimes subregion, and finally, the knowledge on physiography needs to be supplemented by local information on natural, anthropic and health system processes including malaria control.
   Ecotyping can therefore not be seen as a shortcut to determine control interventions, but rather as a framework to supplement available epidemiological and entomological data so as to assess malaria situations at the local level, think through the particular risks and opportunities and reinforce intersectoral action. With these caveats, it does however emerge that several ecotypic distinctions are well defined and have relatively constant implications for control within certain biogeographic regions. Forest environments in the Indo-malay and the Neotropics are, with a few exceptions, associated with much higher malaria risk than in adjacent areas; the vectors are difficult to control, and the anthropic factors also often converge to impose constraints. Urban malaria in Africa is associated with lower risk than savanna malaria; larval control may be considered though its role is not so far well established. In contrast, urban malaria in the Indian subcontinent is associated with higher risks than most adjacent rural areas, and larval control has a definite, though not exclusive, role.
   Simulation modelling of cost-effectiveness of malaria control strategies in different scenarios should prioritize ecotypes where malaria control encounters serious technical problems. Further field research on malaria and ecology should be interdisciplinary, especially with geography, and pay more attention to juxtapositions and to anthropic elements, especially migration.

TI  - Evaluation of the population of feral pigs (<i>Sus scrofa</i>) and their impact on the Sierra La Laguna biosphere reserve, Baja California Sur, Mexico
T2  - TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE
AB  - The feral pig (Sus scrofa) is an exotic, invasive species that has major impacts on natural ecosystems. Its presence in the Baja California Peninsula dates from the 18th century. We determined its relative abundance and distribution in the "Sierra La Laguna" Biosphere Reserve" (REBISLA), as well as a preliminary analysis of its diet and impact to the soils and vegetation. We applied interviews to the local residents and realized 16 routes, each a kilometer long in different vegetation types and collected data at 75 points. The impact on the vegetation and soil ground was measured in 40 quadrants (each 25 m(2)), where the impact of feral pigs on perennial plants and the soil surface was recorded. We took samples of the seeds and soil in 60 quadrants (each 1 m(2)), some containing evidence of feral pig and others did not. We analyzed the stomach contents of eight feral pigs. The feral pig in the reserve is common at moderate levels of impact. The most impacted vegetation is the pine-oak forest. The feral pig population is very dynamic, related to climatic factors, such as extreme droughts. Escaped pigs from small, local farms are constantly entering the reserve. One problem in monitoring the impact of feral pigs is their high mobility in their search for food and water. Continue monitoring multi-seasonally and multi-annual is recommended to determine if their presence represents a danger to the vegetation.

TI  - Genome and Transcriptome Analysis of the Fungal Pathogen <i>Fusarium oxysporum</i> f. sp <i>cubense</i> Causing Banana Vascular Wilt Disease
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Background: The asexual fungus Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (Foc) causing vascular wilt disease is one of the most devastating pathogens of banana (Musa spp.). To understand the molecular underpinning of pathogenicity in Foc, the genomes and transcriptomes of two Foc isolates were sequenced.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Genome analysis revealed that the genome structures of race 1 and race 4 isolates were highly syntenic with those of F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici strain Fol4287. A large number of putative virulence associated genes were identified in both Foc genomes, including genes putatively involved in root attachment, cell degradation, detoxification of toxin, transport, secondary metabolites biosynthesis and signal transductions. Importantly, relative to the Foc race 1 isolate (Foc1), the Foc race 4 isolate (Foc4) has evolved with some expanded gene families of transporters and transcription factors for transport of toxins and nutrients that may facilitate its ability to adapt to host environments and contribute to pathogenicity to banana. Transcriptome analysis disclosed a significant difference in transcriptional responses between Foc1 and Foc4 at 48 h post inoculation to the banana 'Brazil' in comparison with the vegetative growth stage. Of particular note, more virulence-associated genes were up regulated in Foc4 than in Foc1. Several signaling pathways like the mitogen-activated protein kinase Fmk1 mediated invasion growth pathway, the FGA1-mediated G protein signaling pathway and a pathogenicity associated two-component system were activated in Foc4 rather than in Foc1. Together, these differences in gene content and transcription response between Foc1 and Foc4 might account for variation in their virulence during infection of the banana variety 'Brazil'.
   Conclusions/Significance: Foc genome sequences will facilitate us to identify pathogenicity mechanism involved in the banana vascular wilt disease development. These will thus advance us develop effective methods for managing the banana vascular wilt disease, including improvement of disease resistance in banana.

TI  - Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in central Bolivia: Relationships between reservoir hosts, habitats, and viral genotypes
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - In August 2002, two cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) were confirmed in Mineros and Concepcion, within the Santa Cruz Department of Bolivia. Extensive alteration of the native ecosystem, from dense forest to pasture or sugarcane, had occurred in both regions. An ecologic assessment of reservoir species associated with the human disease identified a single hantavirus antibody-positive Oligoryzonzys microtis from Mineros and three hantavirus antibody-positive Calomys callosits from Concepcion. In Mineros, the virus from the O. microtis was 90% similar to sequences published for Rio Mamore virus. Viral nucleotide sequences from two C. callosits were 87-88% similar to the sequence of Laguna Negra virus. The viral sequence from the C. callosus was 99% identical to viral sequences obtained from the HPS patient in this area, implicating C. callosits as the host and Laguna Negra virus as the agent responsible for the HPS case near Concepcion.

TI  - Ecosystem services provided by bromeliad plants: A systematic review
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB  - The unprecedented loss of biological diversity has negative impacts on ecosystems and the associated benefits which they provide to humans. Bromeliads have high diversity throughout the Neotropics, but they have been negatively affected by habitat loss and fragmentation, climate change, invasive species, and commercialization for ornamental purpose. These plants provide direct benefits to the human society, and they also form microecosystems in which accumulated water and nutrients support the communities of aquatic and terrestrial species, thus maintaining local diversity. We performed a systematic review of the contribution of bromeliads to ecosystem services across their native geographical distribution. We showed that bromeliads provide a range of ecosystem services such as maintenance of biodiversity, community structure, nutrient cycling, and the provisioning of food and water. Moreover, bromeliads can regulate the spread of diseases, and water and carbon cycling, and they have the potential to become important sources of chemical and pharmaceutical products. The majority of this research was performed in Brazil, but future research from other Neotropical countries with a high diversity of bromeliads would fill the current knowledge gaps and increase the generality of these findings. This systematic review identified that future research should focus on provisioning, regulating, and cultural services that have been currently overlooked. This would enhance our understanding of how bromeliad diversity contributes to human welfare, and the negative consequences that loss of bromeliad plants can have on communities of other species and the healthy functioning of the entire ecosystems.

TI  - Mixed mating strategies and pollination by insects and wind in coconut palm (<i>Cocos nucifera</i> L. (Arecaceae)):: importance in production and selection
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - 1 Coconut is one of the most important tropical crops. It is threatened by Lethal yellowing disease. Production and selection by breeding require pollination, yet little is known of the pollination requirements and breeding system of this palm.
   2 This study was carried out from 1999 to 2001 in coconut plantations represented by five coconut ecotypes commonly found in Mexico. It is the first Study in the Neotropics on pollination and the breeding system of this paint.
   3 Hymenoptera were the most numerous and diverse visitors to coconut flowers. The greatest period of insect abundance Occurred during the rainy season (July to October). Insect abundance on the flowers correlated highly and positively with precipitation.
   4 The abundance of visitors to pistillate flowers did not vary with season but there were significant differences between palm ecotypes; the most insect-visited flowers were of the Atlantic Tall ecotype.
   5 The introduced honeybee (Apis mellifera) had the most appropriate foraging behaviour, visiting both pistillate and staminate flowers. These insects were probably the most efficient pollinators as they carry pollen on their ventral surface. Ants were present on flowers day and night but had no effect on pollination.
   6 Pollination experiments indicated a mixed mating strategy: self-pollination by geitenogamy produced almost 19% of the fruit set, but cross-pollination (xenogamy) was the most important contribution (c. 30%). Anemophilous cross-pollination only accounted for 10% of fruit set, whereas entomophily became the most important pollination mechanism under Yucatan conditions.
   7 As coconut palm grows naturally on the oceanic strand in a wide variety of seasonal conditions of wind and rain, we suggest that they may have evolved pollination, breeding and mating systems that ensure fruit production under a wide variety of conditions, while maximizing the probability of cross-pollination.

TI  - The HIV epidemic in the amazon basin is driven by prototypic and recombinant HIV-1 subtypes B and F
T2  - JOURNAL OF ACQUIRED IMMUNE DEFICIENCY SYNDROMES
AB  - This paper describes genetic subtypes of HIV-1 found in blood samples from 31 HIV-1-infected people who visited the Counseling and Testing AIDS Center of Institute de Medicina Tropical in Manaus, Brazil. Manaus, the main city in Brazil's Amazon Basin, is also the closest urban connection for more than 100,000 Indians living in the rain forests of this region. Although to date there is no evidence of increased incidence of HIV-1 infection among the indigenous population, our understanding of both the prevalence and nature of the epidemic in the region as a whole is limited. From the 31 samples analyzed by C2V3 sequencing, we found almost equal proportions of HIV-1 strains belonging to subtype B (n = 16; 51.6%) and subtype F (n = 15; 48.4%), a finding that differs from results from previous studies conducted in urban areas of southeastern Brazil. We also observed the presence of the GWGR amino-acid sequence in the critical tetra-peptide crown of the env V3 loop in the HIV-1 subtype B samples analyzed. Among these samples, we also found 14 mosaic genomes (45.16%) in which different combinations of subtypes B, C, and F were identified between the p24 gag, pro, and env regions. Our data support the hypothesis that the Amazonian HIV-1 infections linked to the urban epidemic in southeastern Brazil. The genetic diversity and the prevalence of mosaic genomes among the isolates in our study confirm an integral role of recombination in the complex Brazilian epidemic.

TI  - Spatial heterogeneity of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome is driven by environmental factors and rodent community composition
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is a rodent-borne disease caused mainly by two hantaviruses in China: Hantaan virus and Seoul virus. Environmental factors can significantly affect the risk of contracting hantavirus infections, primarily through their effects on rodent population dynamics and human-rodent contact. We aimed to clarify the environmental risk factors favoring rodent-to-human transmission to provide scientific evidence for developing effective HFRS prevention and control strategies. The 10-year (2006-2015) field surveillance data from the rodent hosts for hantavirus, the epidemiological and environmental data extracted from satellite images and meteorological stations, rodent-to-human transmission rates and impacts of the environment on rodent community composition were used to quantify the relationships among environmental factors, rodent species and HFRS occurrence. The study included 709 cases of HFRS. Rodent species in Chenzhou, a hantavirus hotspot, comprise mainly Rattus norvegicus, Mus musculus, R. flavipectus and some other species (R. losea and Microtus fortis calamorum). The rodent species played different roles across the various land types we examined, but all of them were associated with transmission risks. Some species were associated with HFRS occurrence risk in forest and water bodies. R. norvegicus and R. flavipectus were associated with risk of HFRS incidence in grassland, whereas M. musculus and R. flavipectus were associated with this risk in built-on land. The rodent community composition was also associated with environmental variability. The predictive risk models based on these significant factors were validated by a good-fit model, where: cultivated land was predicted to represent the highest risk for HFRS incidence, which accords with the statistics for HFRS cases in 2014-2015. The spatial heterogeneity of HFRS disease may be influenced by rodent community composition, which is associated with local environmental conditions. Therefore, future work should focus on preventing HFRS is moist, warm environments.

TI  - Six years of fruit fly surveys in Bangladesh: a new species, 33 new country records and discovery of the highly invasive <i>Bactrocera carambolae</i> (Diptera, Tephritidae)
T2  - ZOOKEYS
AB  - We engaged in six years of snap-shot surveys for fruit flies in rural environments and ten protected forest areas of Bangladesh, using traps baited with male lures (cue-lure, methyl eugenol, zingerone). Our work has increased the recorded number of species of Tephritidae in the country from seven to 37. We summarize these surveys and report eight new country occurrence records, and a new species (Zeugodacus madhupuri Leblanc & Doorenweerd, sp. nov.) is described. The highlight among the new records is the discovery, and significant westward range extension, of Bactrocera carambolae Drew & Hancock, a major fruit pest detected in the Chattogram and Sylhet Divisions. We rectify the previously published erroneous record of Bactrocera bogorensis (Hardy), which was based on a misidentification of Zeugodacus diaphorus (Hendel). We also report the occurrence in Bangladesh of nine other Tephritidae, the rearing of three primary fruit fly parasitoids from Zeugodacus, and records of non-target attraction to fruit fly lures.

TI  - Visceral leishmaniasis in an environmentally protected area in southeastern Brazil: Epidemiological and laboratory cross-sectional investigation of phlebotomine fauna, wild hosts and canine cases
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   Leishmaniasis is a rapidly expanding zoonosis that shows increasing urbanization. Concern exists regarding the role of wildlife in visceral leishmaniasis (VL) transmission, due to frequent natural or anthropogenic environmental changes that facilitate contact between wildlife, humans and their pets. The municipality of Campinas, in southeastern Brazil, initially recorded VL in 2009, when the first autochthonous case was confirmed in a dog living in an upscale residential condominium, located inside an environmentally protected area (EPA). Since then, disease transmission remains restricted to dogs inhabiting two geographically contiguous condominiums within the EPA.
   Methodology/Principal findings
   We conducted a cross-sectional study of the VL focus to investigate Leishmania spp. infection in domestic dogs, wild mammals and sand flies using molecular tools and recommended serological techniques. Canine seroprevalences of 1.5% and 1.2% were observed in 2013 and 2015, respectively. Six insect species, confirmed or suspected vectors or potential transmitters of Leishmania, were identified. Two specimens of the main L. (L.) infantum vector in Brazil, Lutzomyia longipalpis, were captured in the EPA. Natural infection by L. (L.) infantum was recorded in one Expapillata firmatoi specimen and two Pintomyia monticola. Natural infection by L. (L.) infantum and Leishmania subgenus Viannia was also detected in two white-eared opossums (Didelphis albiventris), a known reservoir of VL. Geographical coordinates of each sampling of infected animals were plotted on a map of the EPA, demonstrating proximity between these animals, human residences, including the dogs positive for VL, and forest areas.
   Conclusions/Significance
   The EPA, which is inhabited by humans, has an active VL focus. The risk of establishing and maintaining disease transmission foci in similar scenarios, i.e. wild areas that undergo environmental modifications, is evident. Moreover, different epidemiological profiles of VL must be included to elaborate prevention and control measures that consider the particularities of each transmission area.

TI  - Monitoring three-decade dynamics of citrus planting in Southeastern China using dense Landsat records
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
AB  - Across Southeastern China, the expansion of citrus plantation has underpinned substantial economic development at the expense of forest cover and associated ecosystem services. The high-order complexity of citrus planting dynamics requires more detailed observations. To achieve this goal, we developed a novel monitoring scheme by integrating multi-epoch land cover classification and continuous change detection on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform using all available Landsat archives (1986-2018). First, a stable/changed area masking approach was adopted. Then, the GEE-based Continuous Change Detection and Classification (GEE-CCDC) algorithm was applied to detect the timing and position of citrus planting-related land cover changes. Finally, the effectiveness of the scheme was validated both spatially and temporally. We applied the proposed scheme in Xunwu, a typical County in Southeastern China where continuous expansion was disrupted by an outbreak of Huanglongbing (HLB, a destructive citrus disease). The validation results indicate that the multiepoch classification effectively identified the stable, abandoned, and newly cultivated areas related to citrus planting. Within these areas, our monitoring of citrus planting dynamics had an overall temporal accuracy of 90.59% and a mean detection date deviation of 13.21 days (leading). Based on the change detection results, we found a two-stage change pattern, namely a continuous expansion period (1986-2016) followed by a disturbance period (2017-2018). Moreover, almost half of the orchards were cultivated in regions with an elevation and slope of 301-400 m and 11-20 degrees. During the continuous expansion period, a total of 497.85 km(2) natural lands were converted for citrus planting. Affected by the HLB outbreak, both orchard abandonment (114.66 km(2)) and new orchard cultivation (36.87 km(2)) were detected during the disturbance period. The proposed scheme offers a useful tool for cash crops management, and highlights the value of dense satellite data in monitoring the extent of ongoing human appropriation of natural ecosystems at a large scale and long-term.

TI  - Analysis of mitochondrial enzymatic activity in blood lymphomonocyte fractions during infection with different <i>Trypanosoma cruzi</i> strains
T2  - REVISTA DO INSTITUTO DE MEDICINA TROPICAL DE SAO PAULO
AB  - Proinflammatory and inflammatory mediators induced by Trypanosoma cruzi infection increase the oxidative stress, generating toxicity for cells targeting mitochondria of different tissues. We studied the activity of citrate synthase and complexes I-IV of respiratory chain in mitochondria of blood lymphomonocyte fraction, from albino Swiss mice infected with different isolates of T cruzi, during Chagas disease evolution. Complexes I-IV were modified in infected groups (p<0.05) in all the stages, and an inflammatory process of different magnitudes was detected in the heart and skeletal muscle according to the isolate. The citrate synthase activity presented modifications in the SGO Z12 and the Tulahuen group (p<0.05). Hearts showed fiber fragmentation and fibrosis; skeletal muscle presented inflammatory infiltrates and in the Tulahuen infected group, there were also amastigote nests. The inflammatory processes produced an oxidative stress that induced different alterations of mitochondrial enzymes activities in the lymphomonocyte fraction that can be detected by a simple blood extraction, suggesting that they could be used as disease markers, especially in the indeterminate phase of Chagas disease.

TI  - Evaluating spatiotemporal dynamics of snakebite in Sri Lanka: Monthly incidence mapping from a national representative survey sample
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   Snakebite incidence shows both spatial and temporal variation. However, no study has evaluated spatiotemporal patterns of snakebites across a country or region in detail. We used a nationally representative population sample to evaluate spatiotemporal patterns of snakebite in Sri Lanka.
   Methodology
   We conducted a community-based cross-sectional survey representing all nine provinces of Sri Lanka. We interviewed 165 665 people (0.8% of the national population), and snakebite events reported by the respondents were recorded. Sri Lanka is an agricultural country; its central, southern and western parts receive rain mainly from Southwest monsoon (May to September) and northern and eastern parts receive rain mainly from Northeast monsoon (November to February). We developed spatiotemporal models using multivariate Poisson process modelling to explain monthly snakebite and envenoming incidences in the country. These models were developed at the provincial level to explain local spatiotemporal patterns.
   Principal findings
   Snakebites and envenomings showed clear spatiotemporal patterns. Snakebite hotspots were found in North-Central, North-West, South-West and Eastern Sri Lanka. They exhibited biannual seasonal patterns except in South-Western inlands, which showed triannual seasonality. Envenoming hotspots were confined to North-Central, East and South-West parts of the country. Hotspots in North-Central regions showed triannual seasonal patterns and South-West regions had annual patterns. Hotspots remained persistent throughout the year in Eastern regions. The overall monthly snakebite and envenoming incidences in Sri Lanka were 39 (95%CI: 38-40) and 19 (95%CI: 13-30) per 100 000, respectively, translating into 110 000 (95%CI: 107 500-112 500) snakebites and 45 000 (95%CI: 32 000-73 000) envenomings in a calendar year.
   Conclusions/significance
   This study provides information on community-based monthly incidence of snakebites and envenomings over the whole country. Thus, it provides useful insights into healthcare decision-making, such as, prioritizing locations to establish specialized centres for snakebite management and allocating resources based on risk assessments which take into account both location and season.
   Author summary
   Snakebite envenoming is a neglected tropical disease which mainly affects people living in rural areas of the tropics. Snakebite can result in in mild, moderate or severe envenomation, psychological disturbances, long-term disability, and deaths. Snakebite incidence demonstrates both spatial variation and seasonal patterns in many countries, but there have been no previous in-depth evaluations of spatiotemporal patterns of snakebite risk at a country level. We undertook an island-wide community survey to determine the spatiotemporal patterns of snakebite in the country. Both snakebites and snakebite envenomings showed clear spatiotemporal patterns where certain hotspots persisted throughout the year while others showed dynamic changes within a year. We found that the monthly snakebite incidence was 39 per 100,000 and envenoming incidences was 19 per 100,000 in Sri Lanka. We developed monthly snakebite and snakebite envenoming risk maps to identify snakebite hotspots and cold spots in the country. These maps provide useful insights into healthcare decision-making, such as, prioritizing locations to establish specialized centres for snakebite management and allocating resources based on risk assessments which consider both location and season. Our methodology demonstrates a general approach to model times and places of individual events and address the effects of variable survey effort and recall bias associated with epidemiological surveys.

TI  - Value and Limitations of Broad Brush Surveys Used in Community-Randomized Trials in Southern Africa
T2  - QUALITATIVE HEALTH RESEARCH
AB  - We describe and reflect on a rapid qualitative survey approach called "Broad Brush Survey" (BBS) used in six community-randomized trials (CRTs)/studies in Zambia and South Africa (2004-2018) to document, compare, classify, and communicate community features systematically for public health and multidisciplinary research ends. BBS is based on a set sequence of participatory qualitative methods and fieldwork carried out prior to a CRT intervention and/or research by social scientists to generate rapid community profiles using four key indicators: physical features, social organization, networks, and community narratives. Profiling makes apparent similarities and differences, enabling comparison across communities and can be facilitated by an ideal model of open-closed systems. Findings have provided practical outputs (e.g., community profiles) and academic opportunities (e.g., community typologies). The BBS approach enables complex social landscapes to be incorporated in CRTs. This method has proven to be useful, adaptable and to have multidisciplinary appeal.

TI  - Density-dependent parasite establishment suggests infection-associated immunosuppression as an important mechanism for parasite density regulation in onchocerciasis
T2  - TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
CP  - Meeting of the Royal-Society-of-Tropical-Medicine-and-Hygiene
AB  - The modulation of human immune response by filarial parasites has yielded contradictory experimental findings and attracted much controversy. We address the unresolved question of acquisition, establishment and accumulation of Onchocerca volvulus by using a modelling approach that relates computer simulations to cross-sectional data concerning parasite burdens in 913 West African onchocerciasis patients. It is shown that the acquisition of O. volvulus is not constant with host age; instead, the analysis of age profiles of parasite burdens strongly indicate the operation of immunosuppressive processes within the human host, associated with the presence of adult parasites or microfilariae. It is suggested that these processes suppress immunity against incoming infective larvae (L3), which themselves act as an immune modulating component once they have successfully overcome the barrier of concomitant immunity. Suppression of parasite-specific immunity leads to parasite establishment rates which increase along with the parasite burden, but which hardly depend on hyperendemic annual transmission potentials. Children, still immunocompetent due to low parasite burdens, acquire 0.1-0.5 adult female parasites per year, whereas older people, immunosuppressed due to high burdens, acquire 2-4 adult female parasites per year. Differences in parasite establishment between the forest and the savannah strains O. volvulus are quantified and dynamic aspects of density-dependent parasite establishment discussed.

TI  - Review of the Minimus Complex of <i>Anopheles</i>, main malaria vector in Southeast Asia:: from taxonomic issues to vector control strategies
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE & INTERNATIONAL HEALTH
AB  - BACKGROUND The Minimus Complex of Anopheles subgenus Cellia is composed of two sibling species, A and C, on the Southeast Asian mainland, and a third allopatric species E that occurs in the Ryukyu Archipelago (Japan), a malaria-free region. Anopheles minimus s.l. is considered to be one of the main malaria vector in the hilly forested regions of Southeast Asia. Despite a large number of studies over its range of distribution, it is difficult to have a global view of the ecological and bionomical characteristics of the individual species as different identification methods were used, generally without specific identification of the sibling species.
   OBJECTIVES (1) To review the main malaria studies on An. minimus s.l.; (2) to discuss recently published data on the biology and ecology of each sibling species; and (3) to identify gaps in our understanding of the Minimus Complex.
   REVIEW RESULTS Major biological and ecological trends are addressed, such as the high plasticity of trophic behaviour and the sympatry of species A and C over the Southeast Asian mainland. Despite the availability of rapid molecular identification methods, we still lack important information concerning the biological characteristics of each sibling species. These gaps must be filled in the future because An. minimus species A and C may exhibit different abilities to transmit malaria.
   CONCLUSION We expect that entomological surveys will employ molecular methods to clearly identify these two species, and thus elucidate the biological characteristics of each species. As a consequence, current vector control strategies will be improved by targeting the most efficient vectors.

TI  - <i>Leucocytozoon pterotenuis</i> sp nov (Haemosporida, Leucocytozoidae): description of the morphologically unique species from the Grallariidae birds, with remarks on the distribution of <i>Leucocytozoon</i> parasites in the Neotropics
T2  - PARASITOLOGY RESEARCH
AB  - We describe morphologically unique Leucocytozoon pterotenuis sp. nov. (Haemosporida, Leucocytozoidae), the first reported leucocytozoid species developing in fusiform host cell found in a Neotropical passeriform bird. The type host of this parasite is the Chestnut-crowned Antpitta (Grallaria ruficapilla, Grallariidae), an elusive native passerine bird whose natural history remains, to a large degree, unexplored. This bird was captured in Palacio forest in the damping zone of Chingaza National Natural Park, Cundinamarca, Colombia, at 2900 m above sea level (asl). Gametocytes of the new species develop both in roundish and fusiform host cells. This parasite is readily morphologically distinguishable from the described Leucocytozoon species because its host cells possess the narrow (needle-like) spindle-shaped processes, which length markedly exceeds their width. Additionally, the host cell nucleus markedly extends into the processes. Phylogenetic relationships were constructed based on a fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene and the complete mitochondrial genome. Phylogenetic analysis placed the lineage of L. pterotenuis in different positions depending on the length of the sequence analyzed that is likely due to poor sampling of Leucocytozoon species, especially from rare or non-passerine hosts, as well as a paucity of complete mitochondrial sequences of these parasites. Available data indicate that Leucocytozoon parasites are distributed mainly in mountain regions of the Neotropics where unique morphological forms have been recently discovered. To a better knowledge of the diversity of Leucocytozoon spp. and their host-vector-parasite interactions in Neotropical countries, additional deep and intensive samplings are needed, particularly in orders different to Passeriformes.

TI  - <i>Aedes aegypti</i> in Senegal:: Genetic diversity and genetic structure of domestic and sylvatic populations
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Aedes aegypti is the main vector of dengue viruses. The epidemiology of dengue fever remains poorly understood in Senegal. A sylvatic transmission seems to predominate. However, despite the sylvatic circulation of the dengue virus and the presence of vectors in urban areas, only sporadic cases have been reported. Ae. aegypti is a polytypic species. In Senegal, a purely sylvatic form is found in the forest gallery areas and a domestic form is found in the villages in savannah and sahelian areas and in urban areas. Using allozymes, we analyzed the genetic diversity and the genetic structure of Ae. aegypti populations differing in their ecological characteristics. Populations from Senegal were significantly structured but with a low level of genetic differentiation. Ae. aegypti from the "domestic" populations show a decreased genetic diversity and a lower genetic differentiation compared with "sylvatic" populations. These findings suggest that environmental conditions, ecological factors, and human activities may impact the genetic structure of Ae. aegypti populations in Senegal.

TI  - Pathology of natural <i>Przhevalskiana silenus</i> infestation in goats
T2  - TROPICAL BIOMEDICINE
AB  - Among the arthropods causing diseases to animals, myiasis causes a broad range of infestations depending on the location of larvae and its developmental stages on the body of the host. These infestations reduce host physiological functions, destroy host tissues and cause significant economic losses to livestock worldwide. This study was conducted to find out the pathological changes of goats tissue infested with Przhevalskiana silenus. Goat warble fly infestation (GWFI), improperly named goat hypodermosis, is a myiasis caused by larvae of P. silenus. Out of 16,250 goats examined in the slaughter house in the studied area, 433 (2.67%) were infested with warble fly. The minimum and maximum rate of infectivity was 7 and 84 with an average of 32.4 warbles per animal. Histopathological examinations were carried out on the infested subcutaneous tissues. Infiltration of the mononuclear cell types, tissue necrosis, pyogranulomatous reaction, hyalinization, mineralization, muscle fragmentation, oedema, and hyperemia of arterioles and capillaries were the most important microscopic findings associated with different developmental stages of P. silenus instars in the goats. The results of this survey indicated that GWF is a widespread infestation in Shiraz, Fars Province, southern part of Iran.

TI  - Comments on the genus <i>Diplura</i> C. L. Koch, 1850, with description of two new species (Araneae, Mygalomorphae, Dipluridae)
T2  - ZOOKEYS
AB  - Two new species of Diplura C. L. Koch 1850 are described from Brazil: Diplura mapinguari sp. n., from the state of Rondonia in southeastern Amazonia, northern Brazil, and Diplura rodrigoi sp. n., known from southeastern and central west regions of Brazil. Diplura rodrigoi sp. n. is morphologically similar to D. lineata (Lucas, 1857), D. sanguinea (F. O. Pickard-Cambridge, 1896), and D. mapinguari sp. n. Comments on diagnostic characters of Diplura are included. The synonymy of D. maculata (Mello-Leitao, 1927) with D. catharinensis (Mello-Leitao, 1923) is corroborated. A classification of color pattern of the dorsum of the abdomen is given.

TI  - Geographical origin identification of Hainan camellia oil based on fatty acid composition and near infrared spectroscopy combined with chemometrics
T2  - JOURNAL OF FOOD COMPOSITION AND ANALYSIS
AB  - Ensuring the authenticity of the original production region is of utmost importance in safeguarding the reputation and ensuring the quality and safety of Hainan camellia oil, which possesses unique quality and commands a higher price than camellia oil from other main producing areas in China. This study explored the potential of fatty acid composition and near infrared (NIR) spectra for geographical traceability of Hainan camellia oil. The relative content of 16 fatty acids in camellia oil samples was determined using gas chromatography (GC), and the spectral information of the samples was obtained using NIR spectroscopy. The data were then analyzed using chemometrics methods, comparing the classification abilities of partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithms. The results demonstrated that the SVM model based on the fatty acid composition, the CNN model based on the NIR spectra, and the CNN model based on data fusion achieved prediction accuracies of 97.08%, 97.92%, and 98.75%, respectively, enabling high-precision identification of the geographical origin of Hainan camellia oil. This study reveals that the fatty acid composition and NIR spectra can serve as accurate tools for identifying the geographical origin of camellia oil.

T2  - JOURNAL OF INORGANIC BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Sixteen novel mononuclear Cu-II, Co-II, Zn-II, and Ni-II complexes of the biologically active ligand clotrimazole (cloth) of the forms [M(clotri)(2)Cl-2]center dot nH(2)O (1-4), [M(clotri)(2)Br-2]center dot nH(2)O (5-7), [M(clotri)(3)Br-2] (8), [M(clotri)(3)NO3]NO3 center dot nH(2)O (9, 11), [M(clotri)(3)(NO3)(2)]center dot nH(2)O (10), and [M(clotri)(3)(OH2)(2)NO3]NO3 center dot nH(2)O (12) were synthesized and fully characterized. Dinuclear [Cu-2(clotri)(4)mu(2)-Cl-4]center dot 2H(2)O (1a) and [Cu-2(clotri)(4)mu(2)-Br-2]center dot 2H(2)O (5b) as well as tetranuclear [Cu-4(clotri)(4)mu(4)-Br-6 mu(4)-O] (5a) complexes were also isolated. Complexes 1-7,9, and 11 present a tetrahedral geometry; complex 8 exhibits a pentacoordinated structure; complexes la, 10 and 12 an octahedral geometry. X-ray crystal structures of [Cu(clotri)(2)Cl-2](1), [Cu(clotri)(2)(EtOH)Cl-2] (1.EtOH), [Zn(clotri)(2)Cl-2] (3), [Zn(clotri)(2)Br-2] (7), and (Cu-4(clotri)(4)mu(4)-Br-6 mu(4)-O] (5a) were obtained. Complexes 1-12 were tested for cytotoxic activity against the human carcinoma cell lines HeLa (cervix-uterine), PO (prostate), and HCT-15 (colon) displaying IC50 values <30 mu W. Confocal microscopy and nuclear dying (DAPI) for complex 1 showed condensation of cromatin and nuclear membrane fragmentation. Immunocytochemical detection/expression of biomarkers suggests that complexes 1 and 9 induce cell death via apoptosis. TUNEL assay detected DNA fragmentation in HeLa cells, resulting from apoptotic signaling cascades induced by Cu-II complexes 1 and 9. H-1 NMR studies of the Zn-II complexes showed that they can bind to nucleotides. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Phlebotomine fauna (Diptera: Psychodidae) in a <i>campina</i> reserve in the State of Amazonas, and its epidemiological importance
T2  - REVISTA DA SOCIEDADE BRASILEIRA DE MEDICINA TROPICAL
AB  - Introduction: In Brazil, the largest diversity of phlebotomines is found in the Amazon region, particularly in undisturbed terra-firma forest. However, the phlebotomine fauna in other ecosystems of this region is still not well known. Methods: In order to investigate the phlebotomine fauna of another Amazon ecosystem, collections were made using CDC light traps in the campina/campinarana ecosystems in the periurban zone of the city of Manaus. Results: Eight hundred and fourteen phlebotomines of 26 species were captured, of which the most abundant were: Lutzomyia flaviscutellata (64.5%); Lutzomyia georgii (14%); Lutzomyia olmeca nociva (8.1%); Lutzomyia furcata (3.2%); Lutzomyia monstruosa (1.3%); Lutzomyia umbratilis (1.1%); and others (7.8%). Conclusions: The campina/campinarana ecosystems showed great epidemiological importance because of the high abundance of Lutzomyia flaviscutellata and Lutzomyia olmeca nociva, which are both vectors of Leishmania (Leishmania) amazonensis. Based on this information, it will be possible to outline goals for parasitological studies and raise awareness among researchers and students who are constantly exposed in these areas while conducting research work, regarding the possible risk of contamination by Leishmania.

TI  - Long-term trends in habitat selection by Kentucky Warblers
T2  - AUK
AB  - Microhabitat selection of the Kentucky Warbler (Oporornis formosus), a forest-interior Neotropical migrant, was examined using a geographical information system. The distribution of territorial male Kentucky Warblers was mapped within a 460-ha study area in northwestern Virginia from 1979 through 1992. Each annual distribution of territories was compared, using logistic regression, to a random distribution of territories with respect to habitat features codified within a vector-based geographical information system. Kentucky Warblers selected forested areas with cove hardwoods and avoided oak/hickory overstory. The warblers also were found more often in areas that contained streams and in areas with low white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) densities. Since 1979 there have been significant shifts in Kentucky Warbler use of habitat at this site, resulting in fewer territories within oak/hickory and edge habitats.

TI  - Can machine learning models predict maternal and newborn healthcare providers' perception of safety during the COVID-19 pandemic? A cross-sectional study of a global online survey
T2  - HUMAN RESOURCES FOR HEALTH
AB  - Background Maternal and newborn healthcare providers are essential professional groups vulnerable to physical and psychological risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. This study uses machine learning algorithms to create a predictive tool for maternal and newborn healthcare providers' perception of being safe in the workplace globally during the pandemic. Methods We used data collected between 24 March and 5 July 2020 through a global online survey of maternal and newborn healthcare providers. The questionnaire was available in 12 languages. To predict healthcare providers' perception of safety in the workplace, we used features collected in the questionnaire, in addition to publicly available national economic and COVID-19-related factors. We built, trained and tested five machine learning models: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), XGBoost, CatBoost and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for classification and regression. We extracted from RF models the relative contribution of features in output prediction. Results Models included data from 941 maternal and newborn healthcare providers from 89 countries. ML models performed well in classification and regression tasks, whereby RF had 82% cross-validated accuracy for classification, and CatBoost with 0.46 cross-validated root mean square error for regression. In both classification and regression, the most important features contributing to output prediction were classified as three themes: (1) information accessibility, clarity and quality; (2) availability of support and means of protection; and (3) COVID-19 epidemiology. Conclusion This study identified salient features contributing to maternal and newborn healthcare providers perception of safety in the workplace. The developed tool can be used by health systems globally to allow real-time learning from data collected during a health system shock. By responding in real-time to the needs of healthcare providers, health systems could prevent potential negative consequences on the quality of care offered to women and newborns.

TI  - Understorey environments influence functional diversity in tank-bromeliad ecosystems
T2  - FRESHWATER BIOLOGY
AB  - 1. A substantial fraction of the freshwater available in neotropical forests is impounded within the rosettes of bromeliads that form aquatic islands in a terrestrial matrix. The ecosystem functioning of bromeliads is known to be influenced by the composition of the contained community but it is not clear whether bromeliad food webs remain functionally similar against a background of variation in the understorey environment.
   2. We considered a broad range of environmental conditions, including incident light and incoming litter, and quantified the distribution of a very wide range of freshwater organisms (from viruses to macroinvertebrates) to determine the factors that influence the functional structure of bromeliad food webs in samples taken from 171 tank-bromeliads.
   3. We observed a gradient of detritus-based to algal-based food webs from the understorey to the overstorey. Algae, rotifers and collector and predatory invertebrates dominated bromeliad food webs in exposed areas, whereas filter-feeding insects had their highest densities in shaded forest areas. Viruses, bacteria and fungi showed no clear density patterns. Detritus decomposition is mainly due to microbial activity in understorey bromeliads where filter feeders are the main consumers of microbial and particulate organic matter (POM). Algal biomass may exceed bacterial biomass in sun-exposed bromeliads where amounts of detritus were lower but functional diversity was highest.
   4. Our results provide evidence that tank-bromeliads, which grow in a broad range of ecological conditions, promote aquatic food web diversity in neotropical forests. Moreover, although bromeliad ecosystems have been categorised as detritus-based systems in the literature, we show that algal production can support a non-detrital food web in these systems.

TI  - Hierarchical dynamic models for multivariate times series of counts
T2  - STATISTICS AND ITS INTERFACE
AB  - In several application areas, we see the need for accurate statistical modeling of multivariate time series of counts as a function of relevant covariates. In ecology, count responses on species abundance are observed over several time periods at several locations, and the covariates that influence the abundance may be location-specific and/or time-varying. This paper describes a Bayesian framework for estimation and prediction by assuming a multivariate Poisson sampling distribution for the count responses and by fitting a hierarchical dynamic model. Our modeling incorporates the temporal dependence as well as dependence between the components of the response vector.

TI  - EVALUATING APPROACHES FOR DEVELOPING ELITE <i>ACACIA</i> HYBRID CLONES IN VIETNAM: TOWARDS AN UPDATED STRATEGY
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL FOREST SCIENCE
AB  - Acacia hybrid (A. mangium x A. auriculiformis) clones are planted on a large scale in Vietnam and it is desirable to expand the genetic base beyond the 10 commercial clones that comprise most of the plantation estate. Two approaches for developing elite clones from new Acacia hybrid genotypes derived from open-pollinated pure-species seedlots were compared. Method 1 involved identifying candidates in the nursery on the basis of seedling morphology followed by field trials of about 5000 putative hybrid seedlings. At 2 years, the best 3% of seedling candidates were reselected, captured and propagated for clonal screening trials. Method 2 captured and then clonally tested all putative hybrid genotypes identified on their morphology in pure-species field progeny trials at age 2 years. Method 1 was found to be much more effective at identifying promising new clones. Eighty-one of 196 candidate clones from this method had stem diameters at 2-3 years greater than or equal to the mean of commercial clone controls included in the clone trials. Method 2 yielded only 13 similarly promising new clones from 262 candidates. Maternal parents of both species yielded promising new clones. Overall timelines and a strategy are proposed and discussed for developing new elite Acacia hybrid clones, superior not only in growth but also in disease tolerance, wind-firmness and other important traits.

TI  - y <i>Cyperus articulatus</i> L. (Cyperaceae) Rhizome Essential Oil Causes Cell Cycle Arrest in the G<sub>2</sub>/M Phase and Cell Death in HepG2 Cells and Inhibits the Development of Tumors in a Xenograft Model
T2  - MOLECULES
AB  - Cyperus articulatus L. (Cyperaceae), popularly known in Brazil as "priprioca" or "piriprioca", is a tropical and subtropical plant used in popular medical practices to treat many diseases, including cancer. In this study, C. articulatus rhizome essential oil (EO), collected from the Brazilian Amazon rainforest, was addressed in relation to its chemical composition, induction of cell death in vitro and inhibition of tumor development in vivo, using human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells as a cell model. EO was obtained by hydrodistillation using a Clevenger-type apparatus and characterized qualitatively and quantitatively by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and gas chromatography with flame ionization detection (GC-FID), respectively. The cytotoxic activity of EO was examined against five cancer cell lines (HepG2, HCT116, MCF-7, HL-60 and B16-F10) and one non-cancerous one (MRC-5) using the Alamar blue assay. Cell cycle distribution and cell death were investigated using flow cytometry in HepG2 cells treated with EO after 24, 48 and 72 h of incubation. The cells were also stained with May-Grunwald-Giemsa to analyze the morphological changes. The anti-liver-cancer activity of EO in vivo was evaluated in C.B-17 severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice with HepG2 cell xenografts. The main representative substances of this EO sample were muskatone (11.6%), cyclocolorenone (10.3%), alpha-pinene (8.26%), pogostol (6.36%), alpha-copaene (4.83%) and caryophyllene oxide (4.82%). EO showed IC50 values for cancer cell lines ranging from 28.5 mu g/mL for HepG2 to >50 mu g/mL for HCT116, and an IC50 value for non-cancerous of 46.0 mu g/mL (MRC-5), showing selectivity indices below 2-fold for all cancer cells tested. HepG2 cells treated with EO showed cell cycle arrest at G(2)/M along with internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. The morphological alterations included cell shrinkage and chromatin condensation. Treatment with EO also increased the percentage of apoptotic-like cells. The in vivo tumor mass inhibition rates of EO were 46.5-50.0%. The results obtained indicate the anti-liver-cancer potential of C. articulatus rhizome EO.

TI  - Chronic epididymitis due to <i>Chlamydia trachomatis</i> LGV-L2 in an HIV-negative heterosexual patient: a case report
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Chlamydia trachomatis is an obligate intracellular pathogen and the leading bacterial cause of sexually transmitted infections worldwide. Chlamydia trachomatis genovars L1-L3 are responsible for lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV), an invasive sexually transmitted disease endemic in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, South America, the Caribbean, India and South East Asia. The typical signs and symptoms of C. trachomatis LGV urogenital infections in men include herpetiform ulcers, inguinal buboes, and/or lymphadenopathies. Since 2003, endemic cases of proctitis and proctocolitis caused by C. trachomatis LGV emerged in Europe, mainly in HIV-positive men who have sex with men (MSM). Scarce data have been reported about unusual clinical presentations of C. trachomatis LGV urogenital infections. Herein, we report a case of a 36-year-old heterosexual, HIV-negative male declaring he did not have sex with men or trans women, who presented to the Urology and Andrology outpatient clinic of a healthcare center from Cordoba, Argentina, with intermittent testicular pain over the preceding 6 months. Doppler ultrasound indicated right epididymitis and funiculitis. Out of 17 sexually transmitted infections (STIs) investigated, a positive result was obtained only for C. trachomatis. Also, semen analysis revealed oligoasthenozoospermia, reduced sperm viability as well as increased sperm DNA fragmentation and necrosis, together with augmented reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and the presence of anti-sperm IgG autoantibodies. In this context, doxycycline 100 mg/12 h for 45 days was prescribed. A post-treatment control documented microbiological cure along with resolution of clinical signs and symptoms and improved semen quality. Strikingly, sequencing of the ompA gene revealed C. trachomatis LGV L2 as the causative uropathogen. Remarkably, the patient did not present the typical signs and symptoms of LGV. Instead, the infection associated with chronic testicular pain, semen inflammation and markedly reduced sperm quality. To our knowledge, this is the first reported evidence of chronic epididymitis due to C. trachomatis LGV L2 infection in an HIV-negative heterosexual man. These findings constitute important and valuable information for researchers and practitioners and highlight that C. trachomatis LGV-L2 should be considered as putative etiologic agent of chronic epididymitis, even in the absence of the typical LGV signs and symptoms.

TI  - Signs and symptoms to determine if a patient presenting in primary care or hospital outpatient settings has COVID-19
T2  - COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS
AB  - Background
   COVID-19 illness is highly variable, ranging from infection with no symptoms through to pneumonia and life-threatening consequences. Symptoms such as fever, cough, or loss of sense of smell (anosmia) or taste (ageusia), can help flag early on if the disease is present. Such information could be used either to rule out COVID-19 disease, or to identify people who need to go for COVID-19 diagnostic tests. This is the second update of this review, which was first published in 2020.
   Objectives
   To assess the diagnostic accuracy of signs and symptoms to determine if a person presenting in primary care or to hospital outpatient settings, such as the emergency department or dedicated COVID-19 clinics, has COVID-19.
   Search methods
   We undertook electronic searches up to 10 June 2021 in the University of Bern living search database. In addition, we checked repositories of COVID-19 publications. We used artificial intelligence text analysis to conduct an initial classification of documents. We did not apply any language restrictions.
   Selection criteria
   Studies were eligible if they included people with clinically suspected COVID-19, or recruited known cases with COVID-19 and also controls without COVID-19 from a single-gate cohort. Studies were eligible when they recruited people presenting to primary care or hospital outpatient settings. Studies that included people who contracted SARS-CoV-2 infection while admitted to hospital were not eligible. The minimum eligible sample size of studies was 10 participants. All signs and symptoms were eligible for this review, including individual signs and symptoms or combinations. We accepted a range of reference standards.
   Data collection and analysis
   Pairs of review authors independently selected all studies, at both title and abstract, and full-text stage. They resolved any disagreements by discussion with a third review author. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias using the QUADAS-2 checklist, and resolved disagreements by discussion with a third review author. Analyses were restricted to prospective studies only. We presented sensitivity and specificity in paired forest plots, in receiver operating characteristic (ROC) space and in dumbbell plots. We estimated summary parameters using a bivariate random-effects meta-analysis whenever five or more primary prospective studies were available, and whenever heterogeneity across studies was deemed acceptable.
   Main results
   We identified 90 studies; for this update we focused on the results of 42 prospective studies with 52,608 participants. Prevalence of COVID-19 disease varied from 3.7% to 60.6% with a median of 27.4%. Thirty-five studies were set in emergency departments or outpatient test centres (46,878 participants), three in primary care settings (1230 participants), two in a mixed population of in- and outpatients in a paediatric hospital setting (493 participants), and two overlapping studies in nursing homes (4007 participants). The studies did not clearly distinguish mild COVID-19 disease from COVID-19 pneumonia, so we present the results for both conditions together.
   Twelve studies had a high risk of bias for selection of participants because they used a high level of preselection to decide whether reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing was needed, or because they enrolled a non-consecutive sample, or because they excluded individuals while they were part of the study base. We rated 36 of the 42 studies as high risk of bias for the index tests because there was little or no detail on how, by whom and when, the symptoms were measured. For most studies, eligibility for testing was dependent on the local case definition and testing criteria that were in effect at the time of the study, meaning most people who were included in studies had already been referred to health services based on the symptoms that we are evaluating in this review.
   The applicability of the results of this review iteration improved in comparison with the previous reviews. This version has more studies of people presenting to ambulatory settings, which is where the majority of assessments for COVID-19 take place. Only three studies presented any data on children separately, and only one focused specifically on older adults.
   We found data on 96 symptoms or combinations of signs and symptoms. Evidence on individual signs as diagnostic tests was rarely reported, so this review reports mainly on the diagnostic value of symptoms. Results were highly variable across studies. Most had very low sensitivity and high specificity. RT-PCR was the most often used reference standard (40/42 studies).
   Only cough (11 studies) had a summary sensitivity above 50% (62.4%, 95% CI 50.6% to 72.9%)); its specificity was low (45.4%, 95% CI 33.5% to 57.9%)). Presence of fever had a sensitivity of 37.6% (95% CI 23.4% to 54.3%) and a specificity of 75.2% (95% CI 56.3% to 87.8%). The summary positive likelihood ratio of cough was 1.14 (95% CI 1.04 to 1.25) and that of fever 1.52 (95% CI 1.10 to 2.10). Sore throat had a summary positive likelihood ratio of 0.814 (95% CI 0.714 to 0.929), which means that its presence increases the probability of having an infectious disease other than COVID-19.
   Dyspnoea (12 studies) and fatigue (8 studies) had a sensitivity of 23.3% (95% CI 16.4% to 31.9%) and 40.2% (95% CI 19.4% to 65.1%) respectively. Their specificity was 75.7% (95% CI 65.2% to 83.9%) and 73.6% (95% CI 48.4% to 89.3%). The summary positive likelihood ratio of dyspnoea was 0.96 (95% CI 0.83 to 1.11) and that of fatigue 1.52 (95% CI 1.21 to 1.91), which means that the presence of fatigue slightly increases the probability of having COVID-19.
   Anosmia alone (7 studies), ageusia alone (5 studies), and anosmia or ageusia (6 studies) had summary sensitivities below 50% but summary specificities over 90%. Anosmia had a summary sensitivity of 26.4% (95% CI 13.8% to 44.6%) and a specificity of 94.2% (95% CI 90.6% to 96.5%). Ageusia had a summary sensitivity of 23.2% (95% CI 10.6% to 43.3%) and a specificity of 92.6% (95% CI 83.1% to 97.0%). Anosmia or ageusia had a summary sensitivity of 39.2% (95% CI 26.5% to 53.6%) and a specificity of 92.1% (95% CI 84.5% to 96.2%). The summary positive likelihood ratios of anosmia alone and anosmia or ageusia were 4.55 (95% CI 3.46 to 5.97) and 4.99 (95% CI 3.22 to 7.75) respectively, which is just below our arbitrary definition of a 'red flag', that is, a positive likelihood ratio of at least 5. The summary positive likelihood ratio of ageusia alone was 3.14 (95% CI 1.79 to 5.51).
   Twenty-four studies assessed combinations of different signs and symptoms, mostly combining olfactory symptoms. By combining symptoms with other information such as contact or travel history, age, gender, and a local recent case detection rate, some mu ltivariable prediction scores reached a sensitivity as high as 90%.
   Authors' conclusions
   Most individual symptoms included in this review have poor diagnostic accuracy. Neither absence nor presence of symptoms are accurate enough to rule in or rule out the disease. The presence of anosmia or ageusia may be useful as a red flag for the presence of COVID-19. The presence of cough also supports further testing. There is currently no evidence to support further testing with PCR in any individuals presenting only with upper respiratory symptoms such as sore throat, coryza or rhinorrhoea.
   Combinations of symptoms with other readily available information such as contact ortravel history, or the local recent case detection rate may prove more useful and should be further investigated in an unselected population presenting to primary care or hospital outpatient settings.
   The diagnostic accuracy of symptoms for COVID-19 is moderate to low and anytesting strategy using symptoms as selection mechanism will result in both large numbers of missed cases and large numbers of people requiring testing. Which one of these is minimised, is determined by the goal of COVID-19 testing strategies, that is, controlling the epidemic by isolating every possible case versus identifying those with clinically important disease so that they can be monitored or treated to optimise their prognosis. The former will require a testing strategy that uses very few symptoms as entry criterion for testing, the latter could focus on more specific symptoms such as fever and anosmia.

TI  - Goat pox virus isolated from an outbreak at Akola, Maharashtra (India) phylogenetically related to Chinese strain
T2  - TROPICAL ANIMAL HEALTH AND PRODUCTION
AB  - In this study, we investigated a goat pox outbreak that occurred in an organized goat farm in a village named Yerenda near Akola, Maharashtra, India during 2007-2008. The outbreak involved in 175 goats including kids of local nondescript breeds with a morbidity, mortality, and case fatality rate, respectively, of 20%, 11.4%, and 60%. The goat pox virus (GTPV) antigen/nucleic acid in the clinical samples was detected by CIE and PCRs whereas virus-specific antibody was detected by using SNT and indirect ELISA. From classical clinical signs coupled with epidemiological details and various diagnostic assays, the causative agent of the outbreaks, GTPV was identified, successfully isolated in Vero cells and characterized. Further, sequence analysis of P32 envelope protein gene revealed that this isolate phylogenetically related closely to Chinese strain.

TI  - Coral reef restoration efforts in Latin American countries and territories
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Coral reefs worldwide are degrading due to climate change, overfishing, pollution, coastal development, coral bleaching, and diseases. In areas where the natural recovery of an ecosystem is negligible or protection through management interventions insufficient, active restoration becomes critical. The Reef Futures symposium in 2018 brought together over 400 reef restoration experts, businesses, and civil organizations, and galvanized them to save coral reefs through restoration or identify alternative solutions. The symposium highlighted that solutions and discoveries from long-term and ongoing coral reef restoration projects in Spanish-speaking countries in the Caribbean and Eastern Tropical Pacific were not well known internationally. Therefore, a meeting of scientists and practitioners working in these locations was held to compile the data on the extent of coral reef restoration efforts, advances and challenges. Here, we present unpublished data from 12 coral reef restoration case studies from five Latin American countries, describe their motivations and techniques used, and provide estimates on total annual project cost per unit area of reef intervened, spatial extent as well as project duration. We found that most projects used direct transplantation, the coral gardening method, micro-fragmentation or larval propagation, and aimed to optimize or scale-up restoration approaches (51%) or provide alternative, sustainable livelihood opportunities (15%) followed by promoting coral reef conservation stewardship and re-establishing a self-sustaining, functioning reef ecosystems (both 13%). Reasons for restoring coral reefs were mainly biotic and experimental (both 42%), followed by idealistic and pragmatic motivations (both 8%). The median annual total cost from all projects was $93,000 USD (range: $10,000 USD-$331,802 USD) (2018 dollars) and intervened a median spatial area of 1 ha (range: 0.06 ha-8.39 ha). The median project duration was 3 years; however, projects have lasted up to 17 years. Project feasibility was high with a median of 0.7 (range: 0.5-0.8). This study closes the knowledge gap between academia and practitioners and overcomes the language barrier by providing the first comprehensive compilation of data from ongoing coral reef restoration efforts in Latin America.

TI  - The Role of Climate Variability in the Spread of Malaria in Bangladeshi Highlands
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Background: Malaria is a major public health problem in Bangladesh, frequently occurring as epidemics since the 1990s. Many factors affect increases in malaria cases, including changes in land use, drug resistance, malaria control programs, socioeconomic issues, and climatic factors. No study has examined the relationship between malaria epidemics and climatic factors in Bangladesh. Here, we investigate the relationship between climatic parameters [rainfall, temperature, humidity, sea surface temperature (SST), El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)], and malaria cases over the last 20 years in the malaria endemic district of Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT).
   Methods and Principal Findings: Monthly malaria case data from January 1989 to December 2008, monthly rainfall, temperature, humidity sea surface temperature in the Bay of Bengal and ENSO index at the Nino Region 3 (NINO3) were used. A generalized linear negative binomial regression model was developed using the number of monthly malaria cases and each of the climatic parameters. After adjusting for potential mutual confounding between climatic factors there was no evidence for any association between the number of malaria cases and temperature, rainfall and humidity. Only a low NDVI was associated with an increase in the number of malaria cases. There was no evidence of an association between malaria cases and SST in the Bay of Bengal and NINO3.
   Conclusion and Significance: It seems counterintuitive that a low NDVI, an indicator of low vegetation greenness, is associated with increases in malaria cases, since the primary vectors in Bangladesh, such as An. dirus, are associated with forests. This relationship can be explained by the drying up of rivers and streams creating suitable breeding sites for the vector fauna. Bangladesh has very high vector species diversity and vectors suited to these habitats may be responsible for the observed results.

TI  - Ploidy versus gender effects on inheritance of quantitative traits in <i>Musa</i> species
T2  - AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF CROP SCIENCE
AB  - Several factors including ploidy and genome composition influence the inheritance of agronomic traits in Musa populations. Research results have indicated that gender determines the inheritance of quantitative traits in this species, but whether inheritance patterns are ploidy-dependent or gender-dependent is not known. The present research is therefore aimed at evaluating the agronomic performance of progenies of 4x -2x versus 2x - 4x crosses in Musa, in other to understand how gender or ploidy affect the inheritance of quantitative traits in inter-ploidy crosses. The study was carried out at the High Rainfall Station of the International Institute for Tropical Agriculture (IITA), Onne in Southeastern Nigeria. Data on phenotypic performances of progenies of 4x -2x and 2x - 4x crosses were collected for two seasons and analysed. The 4x -2x crosses produced predominantly 3x progenies, whereas 2x - 4x crosses gave mostly 2x progenies. The diploid progenies of 2x - 4x crosses were shorter plants, took shorter time to flower and produced smaller bunches. The breeding values for the two groups were higher in the ratoon, than plant crop cycle. Complex microsporogenesis was observed in the parents of higher ploidy level (e. g. 4x) and may have resulted in production of predominantly monoploid gametes, n = 1x = 1C. Crosses between 4x and 2x parents, therefore, produced predominantly 3x progenies in 4x -2x direction, but 2x progenies in 2x - 4x direction. Gender and ploidy determined the inheritance of characters in Musa, but with a preponderance of ploidy. The decision on the ploidy of individuals to serve as female or male parents in crosses is therefore critical.

TI  - Barriers to dog rabies vaccination during an urban rabies outbreak: Qualitative findings from Arequipa, Peru
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   Canine rabies was reintroduced to the city of Arequipa, Peru in March 2015. The Ministry of Health has conducted a series of mass dog vaccination campaigns to contain the outbreak, but canine rabies virus transmission continues in Arequipa's complex urban environment, putting the city's 1 million inhabitants at risk of infection. The proximate driver of canine rabies in Arequipa is low dog vaccination coverage. Our objectives were to qualitatively assess barriers to and facilitators of rabies vaccination during mass campaigns, and to explore strategies to increase participation in future efforts.
   Methodology/Principal findings
   We conducted 8 focus groups (FG) in urban and peri-urban communities of Mariano Melgar district; each FG included both sexes, and campaign participants and non-participants. All FG were transcribed and then coded independently by two coders. Results were summarized using the Social Ecological Model. At the individual level, participants described not knowing enough about rabies and vaccination campaigns, mistrusting the campaign, and being unable to handle their dogs, particularly in peri-urban vs. urban areas. At the interpersonal level, we detected some social pressure to vaccinate dogs, as well as some disparaging of those who invest time and money in pet dogs. At the organizational level, participants found the campaign information to be insufficient and ill-timed, and campaign locations and personnel inadequate. At the community level, the influence of landscape and topography on accessibility to vaccination points was reported differently between participants from the urban and peri-urban areas. Poor security and impermanent housing materials in the peri-urban areas also drives higher prevalence of guard dog ownership for home protection; these dogs usually roam freely on the streets and are more difficult to handle and bring to the vaccination points.
   Conclusions
   A well-designed communication campaign could improve knowledge about canine rabies. Timely messages on where and when vaccination is occurring could increase dog owners' perception of their own ability to bring their dogs to the vaccination points and be part of the campaign. Small changes in the implementation of the campaign at the vaccination points could increase the public's trust and motivation. Location of vaccination points should take into account landscape and community concerns.

AB  - We evaluated a recombinant antigen (OC 3.6 cDNA) expressed in pMAL TM vector for the diagnosis of onchocerciasis in children living in an endemic focus of forest-type onchocerciasis in Nigeria. Using the Western blot with the maltose-binding fusion protein as antigen, 91 per cent of mf-positive children and 24 per cent of endemic normal children were positive. Furthermore, age was not a limitation to the assay. The practical limitations of the assay for field diagnosis of onchocerciasis is discussed.

TI  - Mapping the Geographical Distribution of Lymphatic Filariasis in Zambia
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background Past case reports have indicated that lymphatic filariasis (LF) occurs in Zambia, but knowledge about its geographical distribution and prevalence pattern, and the underlying potential environmental drivers, has been limited. As a background for planning and implementation of control, a country-wide mapping survey was undertaken between 2003 and 2011. Here the mapping activities are outlined, the findings across the numerous survey sites are presented, and the ecological requirements of the LF distribution are explored.
   Methodology/Principal findings Approximately 10,000 adult volunteers from 108 geo-referenced survey sites across Zambia were examined for circulating filarial antigens (CFA) with rapid format ICT cards, and a map indicating the distribution of CFA prevalences in Zambia was prepared. 78% of survey sites had CFA positive cases, with prevalences ranging between 1% and 54%. Most positive survey sites had low prevalence, but six foci with more than 15% prevalence were identified. The observed geographical variation in prevalence pattern was examined in more detail using a species distribution modeling approach to explore environmental requirements for parasite presence, and to predict potential suitable habitats over unsurveyed areas. Of note, areas associated with human modification of the landscape appeared to play an important role for the general presence of LF, whereas temperature (measured as averaged seasonal land surface temperature) seemed to be an important determinant of medium-high prevalence levels.
   Conclusions/significance LF was found to be surprisingly widespread in Zambia, although in most places with low prevalence. The produced maps and the identified environmental correlates of LF infection will provide useful guidance for planning and start-up of geographically targeted and cost-effective LF control in Zambia.
   Author Summary Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a debilitating mosquito borne parasitic infection which worldwide affects more than 120 million people. It is also widespread in Sub-Saharan Africa. A World Health Organization coordinated Global Programme to Eliminate LF has targeted LF for elimination as a public health problem by the year 2020, with annual mass drug administration (MDA) being the primary measure for this endeavor. An important first step before initiating MDA is the geographical mapping of infection in order to delimit the target areas. Past case reports have indicated that LF occurs in Zambia, but knowledge on its distribution and prevalence has been limited. Here we report on a country-wide survey carried out to map the geographical distribution and prevalence pattern across Zambia by screening adult volunteers for specific circulating filarial antigens (CFA). The CFA prevalences observed at the numerous survey sites are presented and mapped to give an indication of LF distribution in the country. The observed geographical variation is furthermore examined using a species distribution modeling approach to explore environmental requirements for LF presence, and to predict potential suitable habitats over unsurveyed areas. The findings provide a firm background for planning and start-up of LF control in Zambia.

TI  - Chikungunya fever: CNS infection and pathologies of a re-emerging arbovirus
T2  - PROGRESS IN NEUROBIOLOGY
AB  - Chikungunya virus (CHIN) is transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes and causes an acute symptomatic illness with fever, skin rash, and incapacitating arthralgia, which can evolve into chronic rheumatoid arthritis in elderly patients. This is a tropical disease originally described in central/east Africa in the 1960s, but its 2004 re-emergence in Africa and rapid spread in lands in and around the Indian Ocean (Reunion island, India, Malaysia) as well as Europe (Italy) led to almost 6 million cases worldwide. The risk of importation and spreading diseases with long-term sequelae is even greater today given the global distribution of the vectors (including in the Americas), increased tourism and the apparent capacity of CHIKV to produce high levels of viremia (10(9)-10(12) virus/ml of blood) and new mutants. CHIKV-associated neuropathology was described early in the 1960s, but it is the unprecedented incidence rate in Indian Ocean areas with efficient clinical facilities that allowed a better description of cases with severe encephalitis, meningoencephalitis, peripheral neuropathies and deaths among newborns (mother-to-child infection), infants and elderly patients. Death rates following CHIKV infection were estimated at 1:1000 cases in la Reunion's outbreak. These clinical observations have been corroborated by experimental infection in several mouse models, leading to CNS pathologies. We further describe in this review the capacity of CHIN to infect neurons and glial cells, delineate the fundamental innate (intrinsic) immune defence mechanisms to protect from infection and argue about the possible mechanisms involved in the encephalopathy.

TI  - Major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC Iα) of Japanese flounder (<i>Paralichthys olivaceus</i>) plays a critical role in defense against intracellular pathogen infection
T2  - FISH & SHELLFISH IMMUNOLOGY
AB  - The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is a highly polymorphic region of the vertebrate genome that plays a critical role in initiating immune responses towards invading pathogens. It is well known that MHC I molecules play a central role in the immune response to viruses. However, rare literatures were reported the role of MHC I in the resistance to intracellular bacteria. Sequences of MHC I alpha were identified in multiple teleost species, including Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus), however, the immunological function of MHC I alpha remain largely unknown. In this study, we examined the expression profile and biological activity of an MHC I alpha homologue, PoMHC I alpha, from P. olivaceus. Structural analysis showed that PoMHC I alpha possesses conserved structural characteristics of MHC I alpha proteins, including MHC_I domain, IGc1 domain, transmembrane region. Expression of PoMHC I alpha was upregulated in a time-dependent manner by extracellular and intracellular bacterial pathogens and viral pathogen infection. Different expression patterns were exhibited in response to the infection of different types of microbial pathogens in different immune tissues. Recombinant PoMHC I alpha increased the capability of host cells to defense against intracellular pathogen Edwardsiella tarda infection and enhanced the expression of immune related genes. The knockdown of PoMHC I alpha attenuated the ability of cells to eliminate E. tarda, which was sustained by the in vivo results that overexpression of PoMHC Ia alpha promoted the host defense against invading E. tarda. Antigen uptake assay indicated PoMHC I alpha participated in cells antigen presentation. Collectively, this study is the first report that MHC I alpha plays an important role in immune defense against intracellular bacterial pathogen in teleost. Taken together, these findings add new insights into the biological function of teleost MI-IC I alpha and emphasize the importance of MHC I gene products for the control of E. tarda infection.

TI  - Mapping the Expansion of Boom Crops in Mainland Southeast Asia Using Dense Time Stacks of Landsat Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - We performed a multi-date composite change detection technique using a dense-time stack of Landsat data to map land-use and land-cover change (LCLUC) in Mainland Southeast Asia (MSEA) with a focus on the expansion of boom crops, primarily tree crops. The supervised classification was performed using Support Vector Machines (SVM), which are supervised non-parametric statistical learning techniques. To select the most suitable SMV classifier and the related parameter settings, we used the training data and performed a two-dimensional grid search with a three-fold internal cross-validation. We worked in seven Landsat footprints and found the linear kernel to be the most suitable for all footprints, but the most suitable regularization parameter C varied across the footprints. We distinguished a total of 41 LCLUCs (13 to 31 classes per footprint) in very dynamic and heterogeneous landscapes. The approach proved useful for distinguishing subtle changes over time and to map a variety of land covers, tree crops, and transformations as long as sufficient training points could be collected for each class. While to date, this approach has only been applied to mapping urban extent and expansion, this study shows that it is also useful for mapping change in rural settings, especially when images from phenologically relevant acquisition dates are included.

Extracts were also tested for their cytotoxic activities on a mamalian cell line (Vero) to determine their selectivity towards the parasite. For the first time, antitrypanosomal activity was identified in the leaves of Dyera costulata and the whole plant of Crymbopogon nardus with IC50 values of 0.58 +/- 0.01 mu g mL(-1) (selectivity index, SI > 169) and 0.31 +/- 0.03 mu g mL(-1) (SI > 323) respectively. These plants could be attractive candidates for treatment of sleeping sickness.

TI  - Metagenomic analysis reveals novel dietary-related viruses in the gut virome of marmosets hybrids (Callithrix jacchus x Callithrix penicillata), Brazil
T2  - VIRUS RESEARCH
AB  - Viral metagenomics has contributed enormously to the characterization of a wide range of viruses infecting animals of all phyla in the last decades. Among Neotropical primates, especially those introduced, knowledge about viral diversity remains poorly studied. Therefore, using metagenomics based on virus enrichment, we explored the viral microbiota present in the feces of introduced common marmosets (Callithrix sp.) in three locations from the Silva Jardim region in the State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Fecal samples were collected from nine marmosets, pooled into three sample pools, and sequenced on Illumina MiSeq platform. Sequence reads were analyzed using a viral metagenomic analysis pipeline and two novel insect viruses belonging to the Parvoviridae and Baculoviridae families were identified. The complete genome of a densovirus (Parvoviridae family) of 5,309 nucleotides (nt) was obtained. The NS1 and VP1 proteins share lower than 32% sequence identity with the corresponding proteins of known members of the subfamily Densovirinae. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that this virus represents a new genus, provisionally named Afoambidensovirus due to its discovery in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. The novel species received the name Afoambidensovirus incertum 1. The complete circular genome of a baculovirus of 107,191 nt was also obtained, showing 60.8% sequence identity with the most closely related member of the Baculoviridae family. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that this virus represents a new species in the Betabaculovirus genus, provisionally named Betabaculovirus incertum 1. In addition, sequences from several families of arthropods in the three pools evaluated were characterized (contigs ranging from 244 to 6,750 nt), corroborating the presence of possible insect hosts with which these new viruses may be associated. Our study expands the knowledge about two viral families known to infect insects, an important component of the marmosets' diet. This identification in hosts' feces samples demonstrates one of the many uses of this type of data and could serve as a basis for future research characterizing viruses in wildlife using noninvasive samples.

TI  - Productivity of <i>Eucalyptus pellita</i> in Sumatra: <i>Acacia mangium</i> Legacy, Response to Phosphorus, and Site Variables for Guiding Management
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - We report on experimental studies conducted in South Sumatra with interrelated objectives to (i) examine the trends in production covering 30 years, including three rotations of Acacia mangium followed by Eucalyptus pellita which replaced A. mangium for managing the widespread threat of diseases; (ii) understand the effects of inter-rotation slash and litter management applied to acacia (legacy effects) on E. pellita growth; (iii) assess the long term changes in the top soil layer arising from above; (iv) evaluate, through a network of experiments, across the landscape, the nature and extent of growth responses to additional phosphorus. This data was also used to explore some of the critical site and stand variables which determine the variations in productivity and responses to management. The current growth rates of E. pellita are lower than those achieved in A. mangium. The management-legacy effects by conserving site resources provides a sustainable base for the growth of E. pellita, but for further increase in productivity, additional management actions are necessary. Changes in soil pH, carbon, N and extractable P were relatively small after four rotations. Supply of P at planting gave wood volume gains at harvest, ranging from 16 to 66% across sites. The plinthite layer in the soil profile was related to productivity, with higher growth rates of E. pellita occurring when the plinthite was at deeper layers. There is much scope for increasing productivity per unit area in this landscape, and available knowledge can be synthesized into a package of best practices for application. Management should aim to improve the quality of inter-rotation management to ensure more than 90% survival, and fast growth rates during the first 2 years. We provide a framework for further research and for refining management to produce the much needed additional domestic wood supply for the local industry.

TI  - A new scenario of bioprospecting of Hymenoptera venoms through proteomic approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF VENOMOUS ANIMALS AND TOXINS INCLUDING TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Venoms represent a huge and essentially unexplored reservoir of bioactive components that may cure diseases that do not respond to currently available therapies. This review select advances reported in the literature from 2000 to the present about the new scenario of Hymenoptera venom composition. On account of new technologies in the proteomic approach, which presents high resolution and sensitivity, the combination of developments in new instruments, fragmentation methods, strategic analysis, and mass spectrometry have become indispensable tools for interrogation of protein expression, molecule interaction, and post-translational modifications. Thus, the biochemical characterization of Hymenoptera venom has become a major subject of research in the area of allergy and immunology, in which proteomics has been an excellent alternative to assist the development of more specific extracts for diagnosis and treatment of hypersensitive patients to Hymenoptera venoms.

TI  - First Report of Widespread Wild Populations of <i>Triatoma infestans</i> (Reduviidae, Triatominae) in the Valleys of La Paz, Bolivia
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Wild populations of Triatoma infestans, the main vector of Chagas disease in the Southern Cone countries, may be involved in reinfestation of human dwellings, limiting the success of vector-control campaigns in Bolivia. Knowledge of the distribution of these populations remains incomplete. We report here the detection of T infestans wild populations in large areas in the department of La Paz, Bolivia. Among 18 sylvatic areas investigated, 17 were positive with T infestans specimens. The infection rate of captured T infestans with Trypanosoma cruzi was 85.7% in adult specimens. These results expand the geographical distribution of wild populations of T. infestans; it may be distributed throughout the Inter-Andean Dry Forest eco-region of Bolivia. The current information allows us to propose the hypothesis that a sylvatic origin of the reinfestation is located in the valleys of La Paz.

TI  - Phytoplasma from little leaf disease affected sweetpotato in Western Australia: detection and phylogeny
T2  - ANNALS OF APPLIED BIOLOGY
AB  - Symptoms of leaf and stem chlorosis and plant stunting were common in sweetpotato plants (Ipomoea batatas) in farmers' fields in two widely separated locations, Kununurra and Broome, in the tropical Kimberley region in the state of Western Australia in 2003 and 2004. In the glasshouse, progeny plants developed similar symptoms characteristic of phytoplasma infection, consisting of chlorosis and a stunted, bushy appearance as a result of proliferation of axillary shoots. The same symptoms were reproduced in the African sweetpotato cv. Tanzania grafted with scions from the plant Aus1 with symptoms and in which no viruses were detected. PCR amplification with phytoplasma-specific primers and sequencing of the 16S-23S rRNA gene region from two plants with symptoms, Aus1 (Broome) and Aus142A (Kununurra), revealed highly identical sequences. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequences obtained from previously described sweetpotato phytoplasma and inclusion of other selected phytoplasma for comparison indicated that Aus1 and Aus142A belonged to the Candidatus Phytoplasma aurantifolia species (16SrII). The 16S genes of Aus1 and Aus142A were almost identical to those of sweet potato little leaf (SPLL-V4) phytoplasma from Australia (99.3%-99.4%) but different from those of the sweetpotato phytoplasma from Taiwan (95.5%-95.6%) and Uganda (SPLL-UG, 90.0%-90.1%). Phylogenetically, Aus1, Aus142A and a phytoplasma previously described from sweetpotato in the Northern Territory of Australia formed a group distinctly different from other isolates within Ca. Phytoplasma aurantifolia species. These findings indicate that novel isolates of the 16SrII-type phytoplasma pose a potential threat to sustainable sweetpotato production in northern Australia.

TI  - Effect of environmental variables and <i>kdr</i> resistance genotype on survival probability and infection rates in <i>Anopheles gambiae</i> (<i>s.s.</i>)
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
AB  - Background: Environmental factors, especially ambient temperature and relative humidity affect both mosquitoes and malaria parasites. The early part of sporogony is most sensitive and is affected by high temperatures and temperature fluctuation immediately following ingestion of an infectious blood meal. The aim of this study was to explore whether environmental variables such as temperature, together with the presence of the kdr insecticide resistance mutations, have an impact on survival probability and infection rates in wild Anopheles gambiae (s.s.) exposed and unexposed to a pyrethroid insecticide.
   Methods:Anopheles gambiae (s.s.) were collected as larvae, reared to adults, and fed on blood samples from 42 Plasmodium falciparum-infected local patients at a health facility in mid-western Uganda, then exposed either to nets treated with sub-lethal doses of deltamethrin or to untreated nets. After seven days, surviving mosquitoes were dissected and their midguts examined for oocysts. Prevalence (proportion infected) and intensity of infection (number of oocysts per infected mosquito) were recorded for each group. Mosquito mortality was recorded daily. Temperature and humidity were recorded every 30 minutes throughout the experiments.
   Results: Our findings indicate that apart from the effect of deltamethrin exposure, mean daily temperature during the incubation period, temperature range during the first 24 hours and on day 4 post-infectious feed had a highly significant effect on the risk of infection. Deltamethrin exposure still significantly impaired survival of kdr homozygous mosquitoes, while mean daily temperature and relative humidity during the incubation period independently affected mosquito mortality. Significant differences in survival of resistant genotypes were detected, with the lowest survival recorded in mosquitoes with heterozygote L1014S/L1014F genotype.
   Conclusions: This study confirmed that the early part of sporogony is most affected by temperature fluctuations, while environmental factors affect mosquito survival. The impact of insecticide resistance on malaria infection and vector survival needs to be assessed separately for mosquitoes with different resistance mechanisms to fully understand its implications for currently available vector control tools and malaria transmission.

T2  - REVISTA DO INSTITUTO DE MEDICINA TROPICAL DE SAO PAULO
AB  - We analyzed the sandflies around houses and domestic animal shelters located in residences close to forests in localities on the banks of the Araguari River, Uberlandia, MG, from February 2003 to November 2004. The phlebotomines were captured in the peridomiciliary area, where Shannon traps were utilized in the peridomicile and CDC traps in animal shelters. 2,783 specimens of sandflies were captured, 2,140 females (76.9%) and 643 males (23.1%), distributed between 17 species. The most abundant species was Nyssomyia neivai (88.1%), followed by Nyssomyia whitmani (3.1%). The presence of Lutzomyia longipalpis was also confirmed, it is the main vector of Leishmania (L.) infantum chagasi which causes visceral leishmaniasis. The presence of species involved in the transmission of leishmaniases in the municipality of Uberlandia is cause for concern. The presence of L. longipalpis indicates that its urbanization may not have been aleatory and instead occurred through the destruction of wild ecotopes. More studies of their occupation in anthropic environments need to be made.

TI  - Transplanting Palms
T2  - HORTTECHNOLOGY
CP  - Workshop on Recent Advances in Palm Horticulture
AB  - The optimum time to transplant palms (Arecaceae) is at the beginning of the warm season in temperate climates or at the beginning of the rainy season in tropical climates if irrigation is unavailable. Careful and proper handling, including covering and protecting the leaves and root ball during transplanting to protect them from injury and drying out and immediate planting upon arrival at the new site, helps to ensure rapid and successful establishment. A root ball extending out from the trunk for 30 cm appears to be adequate for most solitary-stemmed species. Larger root balls may be necessary for multistemmed or unusually tall or large specimens. Tying up leaves facilitates handling during digging, transport, and planting, but it is best to untie them after planting. In most instances leaf removal during transplanting does not appear to be advantageous, and it is probably best to remove leaves only when they die and turn brown. Too deep or too shallow planting lowers transplant success and stresses palms, making them susceptible to diseases, disorders, and pests. Amending the backfill when transplanting palms is not beneficial in most cases. However, mulch applied around the base of the palm after transplanting can enhance growth. Keeping the soil, backfill, and surrounding site soil evenly moist helps to ensure successful establishment.

TI  - The introduction of dengue follows transportation infrastructure changes in the state of Acre, Brazil: A network-based analysis
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Human mobility, presence and passive transportation of Aedes aegypti mosquito, and environmental characteristics are a group of factors which contribute to the success of dengue spread and establishment. To understand this process, we assess data from dengue national and municipal basins regarding population and demographics, transportation network, human mobility, and Ae. aegypti monitoring for the Brazilian state of Acre since the first recorded dengue case in the year 2000 to the year 2015. During this period, several changes in Acre's transport infrastructure and urbanization have been started. To reconstruct the process of dengue introduction in Acre, we propose an analytic framework based on concepts used in malaria literature, namely vulnerability and receptivity, to inform risk assessments in dengue-free regions as well as network theory concepts for disease invasion and propagation. We calculate the probability of dengue importation to Acre from other Brazilian states, the evolution of dengue spread between Acrean municipalities and dengue establishment in the state. Our findings suggest that the landscape changes associated with human mobility have created favorable conditions for the establishment of dengue virus transmission in Acre. The revitalization of its major roads, as well as the increased accessibility by air to and within the state, have increased dengue vulnerability. Unplanned urbanization and population growth, as observed in Acre during the period of study, contribute to ideal conditions for Ae. aegypti mosquito establishment, increase the difficulty in mosquito control and consequently its local receptivity.

TI  - Population structure of the malaria vector <i>Anopheles darlingi</i> in Rondonia, Brazilian Amazon, based on mitochondrial DNA
T2  - MEMORIAS DO INSTITUTO OSWALDO CRUZ
AB  - Anopheles darlingi is the most important Brazilian malaria vector, with a widespread distribution in the Amazon forest. Effective strategies for vector control could be better developed through knowledge of its genetic structure and gene flow among populations, to assess the vector diversity and competence in transmitting Plasmodium. The aim of this study was to assess the genetic diversity of An. darlingi collected at four locations in Porto Velho, by sequencing a fragment of the ND4 mitochondrial gene. From 218 individual mosquitoes, we obtained 20 different haplotypes with a diversity index of 0.756, equivalent to that found in other neotropical anophelines. The analysis did not demonstrate significant population structure. However, haplotype diversity within some populations seems to be over-represented, suggesting the presence of sub-populations, but the presence of highly represented haplotypes complicates this analysis. There was no clear correlation among genetic and geographical distance and there were differences in relation to seasonality, which is important for malarial epidemiology.

TI  - Malaria vectors in South America: current and future scenarios
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
AB  - Background: Malaria remains a significant public health issue in South America. Future climate change may influence the distribution of the disease, which is dependent on the distribution of those Anopheles mosquitoes competent to transmit Plasmodium falciparum. Herein, predictive niche models of the habitat suitability for P. falciparum, the current primary vector Anopheles darlingi and nine other known and/or potential vector species of the Neotropical Albitarsis Complex, were used to document the current situation and project future scenarios under climate changes in South America in 2070.
   Methods: To build each ecological niche model, we employed topography, climate and biome, and the currently defined distribution of P. falciparum, An. darlingi and nine species comprising the Albitarsis Complex in South America. Current and future (i.e., 2070) distributions were forecast by projecting the fitted ecological niche model onto the current environmental situation and two scenarios of simulated climate change. Statistical analyses were performed between the parasite and each vector in both the present and future scenarios to address potential vector roles in the dynamics of malaria transmission.
   Results: Current distributions of malaria vector species were associated with that of P. falciparum, confirming their role in transmission, especially An. darlingi, An. marajoara and An. deaneorum. Projected climate changes included higher temperatures, lower water availability and biome modifications. Regardless of future scenarios considered, the geographic distribution of P. falciparum was exacerbated in 2070 South America, with the distribution of the pathogen covering 35-46 % of the continent. As the current primary vector An. darlingi showed low tolerance for drier environments, the projected climate change would significantly reduce suitable habitat, impacting both its distribution and abundance. Conversely, climate generalist members of the Albitarsis Complex showed significant spatial and temporal expansion potential in 2070, and we conclude these species will become more important in the dynamics of malaria transmission in South America.
   Conclusions: Our data suggest that climate and landscape effects will elevate the importance of members of the Albitarsis Complex in malaria transmission in South America in 2070, highlighting the need for further studies addressing the bionomics, ecology and behaviours of the species comprising the Albitarsis Complex.

TI  - The relative importance of key meteorological factors affecting numbers of mosquito vectors of dengue fever
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Author summaryThe study and control of the numbers of Aedes albopictus, the main vector of dengue fever in China, is crucial for the prevention and control of this mosquito-borne disease. Due to the major impact of rainfall and temperature on mosquito population sizes, we built a mathematical model based on the life cycle of mosquitoes and meteorological and mosquito vector monitoring data in Guangdong Province. Through this model, we explored the effects of temperature, rainfall and their distribution characteristics on the development of the mosquito population and found that they had different effects on the developing stages of mosquitoes in different periods and different locations. Moreover, according to the established meteorological indicators and their importance ranking, it was found that for most areas of Guangdong Province, rainfall was more important than the temperature distribution and the evenness of rainfall distribution, and that the peak rainfall in summer was the best predictor of mosquito population development. In addition, we also developed a method to utilize previous experience in mosquito control, which together with the above conclusions will be of great help in the design of future mosquito vector control strategies and the prediction and early warning of mosquito-borne diseases.
   Although single factors such as rainfall are known to affect the population dynamics of Aedes albopictus, the main vector of dengue fever in Eurasia, the synergistic effects of different meteorological factors are not fully understood. To address this topic, we used meteorological data and mosquito-vector association data including Breteau and ovitrap indices in key areas of dengue outbreaks in Guangdong Province, China, to formulate a five-stage mathematical model for Aedes albopictus population dynamics by integrating multiple meteorological factors. Unknown parameters were estimated using a genetic algorithm, and the results were analyzed by k-Shape clustering, random forest and grey correlation analysis. In addition, the population density of mosquitoes in 2022 was predicted and used for evaluating the effectiveness of the model. We found that there is spatiotemporal heterogeneity in the effects of temperature and rainfall and their distribution characteristics on the diapause period, the numbers of peaks in mosquito densities in summer and the annual total numbers of adult mosquitoes. Moreover, we identified the key meteorological indicators of the mosquito quantity at each stage and that rainfall (seasonal rainfall and annual total rainfall) was more important than the temperature distribution (seasonal average temperature and temperature index) and the uniformity of rainfall annual distribution (coefficient of variation) for most of the areas studied. The peak rainfall during the summer is the best indicator of mosquito population development. The results provide important theoretical support for the future design of mosquito vector control strategies and early warnings of mosquito-borne diseases.

TI  - Pollinator-dependent crops in Brazil yield nearly half of nutrients for humans and livestock feed
T2  - GLOBAL FOOD SECURITY-AGRICULTURE POLICY ECONOMICS AND ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Animal pollination services provide multiple benefits to humanity as they contribute to 35% of global food production and directly account for up to 40% of the dietary nutrient supply to humanity worldwide. Population declines of vertebrate and invertebrate pollination vectors may threaten human nutrition and well-being, particularly where agriculture relies heavily on animal pollinators. We examined the relative differences in nutrient concentrations of 45 leading crops produced throughout Brazil, the world's largest tropical agricultural producer and exporter. We also estimated the overall reductions in nutrient yields under different scenarios of pollinator declines, based on annual agricultural production. Of the 45 top-ranking crops, 29 and 16 were classified as pollinator-dependent and non-dependent, respectively. Pollinator-dependent crops provided 47% of all dietary nutrients supplied in 2017, which had significantly higher concentrations of lipids, vitamin B9, and potassium, while pollinator non-dependent crops provided higher carbohydrate content. Under either a best- or worst-case pollinator declines scenario, we estimate overall nutritional losses of 7.9% and 29.5%, respectively. These losses ranged from 4% to 18% for all macronutrients, 6.8%-26.2% for all minerals, and 2.4%-31.5% for all vitamins. We emphasize the need for land-use strategies that sustain, if not increase pollinator abundance and species diversity to ensure agricultural viability and future food security.

TI  - Kerteszia subgenus of <i>Anopheles</i> associated with the Brazilian Atlantic rainforest:: current knowledge and future challenges
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
AB  - Background: The Atlantic rainforest ecosystem, where bromeliads are abundant, provides an excellent environment for Kerteszia species, because these anophelines use the axils of those plants as larval habitat. Anopheles (K.) cruzii and Anopheles (K.) bellator are considered the primary vectors of malaria in the Atlantic forest. Although the incidence of malaria has declined in some areas of the Atlantic forest, autochthonous cases are still registered every year, with Anopheles cruzii being considered to be a primary vector of both human and simian Plasmodium.
   Methods: Recent publications that addressed ecological aspects that are important for understanding the involvement of Kerteszia species in the epidemiology of malaria in the Atlantic rainforest in the Neotropical Region were analysed.
   Conclusion: The current state of knowledge about Kerteszia species in relation to the Atlantic rainforest ecosystem was discussed. Emphasis was placed on ecological characteristics related to epidemiological aspects of this group of mosquitoes. The main objective was to investigate biological aspects of the species that should be given priority in future studies.

TI  - Arthropod and fungal herbivory at the dawn of angiosperm diversification: The Rose Creek plant assemblage of Nebraska, USA
T2  - CRETACEOUS RESEARCH
AB  - Quantitative studies rarely address arthropod herbivory on early angiosperms. We assessed arthropod herbivory from highly sampled, abundant, diverse, and well preserved Early Cretaceous (late Albian) Rose Creek plant assemblage of southeastern Nebraska, USA. We examined 2084 specimens representing 49 species/morphotypes of which 21 are angiosperms of Austrobaileyales, Chloranthales, Laurales, Magnoliales, and Eurosidae. We used six metrics to assess arthropod herbivory. Richness metrics were damage type (DT) richness, component community structure, and DT host-plant specialization level; intensity metrics were DT frequency, herbivorized surface area, and feeding event occurrences. Eleven functional feeding groups (FFGs) and 114 DTs were present; 87.3% were angiosperm interactions; and 3.14% of surface area was herbivorized. NMDS ordinations show herbivore component communities are distinctive on particular plant lineages, based on herbivorized surface area. Four mostly quantitative measures indicate that piercing-and-sucking and pathogens were the most highly ranked FFGs; mining, hole feeding, galling, and margin feeding were middle ranked; oviposition, surface feeding, and skel-etonization were low ranked; and seed predation and borings were inconsequential. Component com-munity structure of the three most intensively herbivorized hosts, a chloranthalean and two lauralean species, parallel that of a modern fern and four angiosperm species. DT specificities on plant hosts across the assemblage are generalists (64.10%), intermediates (17.95%), and specialists (17.95%). Mining and pathogens lacked whereas gallers were enriched in specialists. Most plant hosts display substantial herbivory richness and intensity, buttressed by distinct herbivore component communities of highly herbivorized species. The Rose Creek herbivory index approximates 0.72% of modern warm-temperate and 0.44% of tropical forests. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Do Monkeypox Exposures Vary by Ethnicity? Comparison of Aka and Bantu Suspected Monkeypox Cases
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - In 2017, a monkeypox outbreak occurred in Likouala Department, Republic of the Congo. Many of the affected individuals were of Aka ethnicity, hunter-gatherers indigenous to Central Africa who have worse health outcomes in comparison with other forest-dwelling peoples. To test the hypothesis that Aka people have different risk factors for monkeypox, we analyzed questionnaire data for 39 suspected cases, comparing Aka and Bantu groups. Aka people were more likely to touch animal urine/feces, find dead animals in/around the home, eat an animal that was found dead, or to have been scratched or bitten by an animal (P < 0.05, all variables). They were also more likely to visit the forest >= once/week, sleep outside, or sleep on the ground (P < 0.001, all variables), providing opportunities for contact with monkeypox reservoirs during the night. The Aka and possibly other vulnerable groups may warrant special attention during educational and health promotion programs.

TI  - Evaluation of antitrypanosomal properties and apoptotic effects of ochrolifuanine from Dyera costulata (Miq.) Hook.f against Trypanosoma brucei brucei
T2  - TROPICAL BIOMEDICINE
AB  - Trypanosoma brucei parasites are flagellated kinetoplastid protozoan which is responsible for Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT). Current chemotherapy drugs have a number of side effects and drug resistance has emerged as a major issue in current treatment. Active bisindole alkaloid compound ochrolifuanine was previously isolated from the leaves of Dyera costulata. In vitro antitrypanosomal activity of ochrolifuanine against Trypanosoma brucei brucei strain BS221 showed strong activity with an IC50 value of 0.05 +/- 0.01 mu g/ml. We compared the effect of ochrolifuanine and reference compound staurosporine in T. b. brucei apoptosis. The apoptosis-inducing activity of ochrolifuanine was evaluated using TUNEL assay and cell cycle analysis. Trypanosoma brucei brucei was shown to undergo apoptotic cells death as demonstrated by the appearance of several conical hallmarks of apoptosis. Ochrolifuanine was found to induce apoptosis in parasites in a dose-and time-dependent manner. The cell cycle study revealed 0.025 and 0.05 mu g/ml of ochrolifuanine arrested the growth of T. b. brucei at two different growth phases (G0/G1 and in S phases). While at concentration 0.10 mu g/ml arrested at the G2/M phase. In conclusion, the results indicate that ochrolifuanine displayed an antitrypanosomal effect on T. b. brucei by inducing apoptosis cell death and causing the arrest of parasite cells at different growth phases. The results suggested that ochrolifuanine may be a promising lead compound for the development of new chemotherapies for African trypanosomiasis.

TI  - Stable infection of primates with <i>Trypanosoma cruzi</i> I and II
T2  - PARASITOLOGY
AB  - In order to better comprehend the putative association between genotype Trypanosoma cruzi I I and primates, an evaluation of the infection in free ranging primates and specimens born in captivity from different geographical areas, the Amazon and the Atlantic forest, was carried out. Seroprevalences of the T. cruzi infection among the primates was similar in both biomes (45.5% and 46%). The parasites were isolated from 8 and 4 different species of primates, respectively from the Amazon and Atlantic forest. Multi-locus enzyme electrophoresis (MLEE) typed the isolates from Amazon as zymoderne 1. Mini-exon gene analysis characterized all these isolates as T. cruzi 1, the main genotype circulating in the region. In the Atlantic forest, primates infected with TCI and TCII, as well as a mixed infection (TCI and TCII), were detected. These findings prove that primates may maintain stable infections by both genotypes. Moreover, data show that T. cruzi can occur in a wide range of primate genera, independent of their social behaviour, niches or habitats. Considering the high seroprevalence and stability of T. cruzi infection among the primates, these animals play an important role in the maintenance of the parasite in nature.

TI  - <i>Vigna</i> spp. Root-Nodules Harbor Potentially Pathogenic Fungi Controlled By Co-habiting Bacteria
T2  - CURRENT MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - This study aimed to isolate, identify, and evaluate the pathogenicity of nodule-borne fungi of asymptomatic Vigna spp. plants, grown in soils from preserved tropical dry forests (Caatinga) areas and identify the occurrence of co-habiting bacteria from these plants, and which have potential to control the co-occurring pathogenic fungi. Fungi and bacteria were isolated from three Vigna species (V. unguiculata, V. radiata, and V. mungo), grown in soil samples collected in five preserved Caatinga areas (Northeastern, Brazil). All fungi and selected bacteria were phylogenetically characterized by the sequencing of ITS1-5.8S-ITS2, and the 16S rRNA gene, respectively. The pathogenicity of fungi in cowpea seeds germination was evaluated throughout the inoculation experiment in Petri dishes and pots containing sterile substrate. The potential of nodule-borne bacteria to control pathogenic fungi in cowpea was assessed in a pot experiment with a sterilized substrate by the co-inoculation of fungi and bacteria isolated from the respective individual plants and soils. The 23 fungal isolates recovered were classified within the genera Fusarium, Macrophomina, Aspergillus, Cladosporium, and Nigrospora. The inoculation of fungi in cowpea seeds reduced the emergence of seeds in Petri dishes and pots. Twenty-four bacteria (Agrobacterium sp., Bradyrhizobium sp., Bacillus sp., Enterobacter sp., Pseudomonas sp., Paraburkholderia sp., and Rhizobium sp.) inhibited the harmful effects of Macrophomina sp. and Fusarium sp., increasing the germination and emergency of potted cowpea plants, highlighting the strains Agrobacterium sp. ESA 686 and Pseudomonas sp. ESA 732 that controlled, respectively, the Fusarium sp. ESA 771 and Macrophomina sp. ESA 786 by 100 and 84.6% of efficiency.

TI  - Pumas <i>Puma concolor</i> as ecological brokers: a review of their biotic relationshipsPalabras clave
T2  - MAMMAL REVIEW
AB  - The puma Puma concolor is the fourth largest wild felid and the most widespread native terrestrial mammal of the Americas. We synthesised published literature documenting the biotic interactions of pumas, in order to: 1) advance our understanding of the ecological roles pumas play in natural systems, and 2) support strategic decision-making about conservation investments, public education, and whole-ecosystem conservation management. We divided puma biotic interactions into five categories: 1) diet and prey regulation, 2) fear effects on prey (including trophic cascades), 3) effects via carrion production, 4) effects on other carnivores, and 5) ecosystem services. We reviewed 162 studies that met our search criteria, which described 543 ecological interactions between pumas and 485 other species. Puma diet and prey regulation was the most common research topic. The geographic distribution of research was highly skewed towards the USA and Canada, and research in Tropical moist forests was underrepresented. We found a steep increase in the number of scientific publications exploring the biotic interactions associated with pumas over time, but publications that reported effect sizes or measured the strength of interactions did not increase as quickly. We noted numerous gaps in our knowledge of puma biotic interactions and found few well-controlled studies of prey fear effects, trophic cascades, or ecosystem services. We conclude that pumas are influential ecological actors in natural systems and important brokers of energy and nutrients throughout ecosystems in the Western Hemisphere, linking disparate species from many trophic levels. Ultimately, we found evidence for investing in and prioritising the protection and restoration of puma populations to conserve biodiversity in the Americas.

TI  - Leptospirosis as a tick-borne disease? Detection of <i>Leptospira</i> spp. in <i>Ixodes ricinus</i> ticks in eastern Poland
T2  - ANNALS OF AGRICULTURAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICINE
AB  - A total of 836 unfed Ixodes ricinus ticks were collected from 2 forested areas of the Lublin region in eastern Poland. Of these, 540 ticks were collected in area 'A', exposed to flooding from the Vistula river, while the remaining 296 ticks were collected in suburban area 'B', not exposed to flooding. Ticks were examined by nested-PCR for the presence of DNA of Leptospira spp. and of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, including its genospecies. The presence of the Leptospira spp. DNA was found in the examined specimens of Ixodes ricinus. The infection rate was much greater in area 'A' exposed to flooding, compared to unexposed area 'B' (15.6% vs. 1.4%, p<0.0001). A significant difference was noted in the case of all developmental stages. For the total results, the prevalence of Leptospira spp. in nymphs (16.9%) was two-fold greater (p<0.01) than in females and males (7.9% and 7.1%, respectively). The total prevalence of B. burgdorferi sensu lato in examined ticks amounted to 24.3%. Altogether, the genospecies Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto was detected most often. No correlation was found to exist between the presence of Leptospira spp. and B. burgdorferi sensu lato in the examined ticks, which indicates that the detection of Leptospira in ticks was not due to a false-positive cross-reaction with DNA of B. burgdorferi. In conclusion, this study shows for the first time the presence of Leptospira spp. in Ixodes ticks and marked frequency of the occurrence of these bacteria in ticks. This finding has significant epidemiological implications by indicating the possibility of the transmission of leptospirosis by Ixodes ricinus, the commonest tick species in Europe and most important vector of numerous pathogens.

TI  - Defence transcriptome assembly and pathogenesis related gene family analysis in <i>Pinus tecunumanii</i> (low elevation)
T2  - BMC GENOMICS
AB  - Background: Fusarium circinatum is a pressing threat to the cultivation of many economically important pine tree species. Efforts to develop effective disease management strategies can be aided by investigating the molecular mechanisms involved in the host-pathogen interaction between F. circinatum and pine species. Pinus tecunumanii and Pinus patula are two closely related tropical pine species that differ widely in their resistance to F. circinatum challenge, being resistant and susceptible respectively, providing the potential for a useful pathosystem to investigate the molecular responses underlying resistance to F. circinatum. However, no genomic resources are available for P. tecunumanii. Pathogenesis-related proteins are classes of proteins that play important roles in plant-microbe interactions, e.g. chitinases; proteins that break down the major structural component of fungal cell walls. Generating a reference sequence for P. tecunumanii and characterizing pathogenesis related gene families in these two pine species is an important step towards unravelling the pine-F. circinatum interaction.
   Results: Eight reference based and 12 de novo assembled transcriptomes were produced, for juvenile shoot tissue from both species. EvidentialGene pipeline redundancy reduction, expression filtering, protein clustering and taxonomic filtering produced a 50 Mb shoot transcriptome consisting of 28,621 contigs for P. tecunumanii and a 72 Mb shoot transcriptome consisting of 52,735 contigs for P. patula. Predicted protein sequences encoded by the assembled transcriptomes were clustered with reference proteomes from 92 other species to identify pathogenesis related gene families in P. patula, P. tecunumanii and other pine species.
   Conclusions: The P. tecunumanii transcriptome is the first gene catalogue for the species, representing an important resource for studying resistance to the pitch canker pathogen, F. circinatum. This study also constitutes, to our knowledge, the largest index of gymnosperm PR-genes to date.

TI  - Helminths found in marmosets (<i>Callithrix penicillata</i> and <i>Callithrix jacchus</i>) introduced to the region of occurrence of golden lion tamarins (<i>Leontopithecus rosalia</i>) in Brazil
T2  - VETERINARY PARASITOLOGY
AB  - The introduction of exotic species can increase the risk of extinction of native species through the introduction of new diseases, predation or resource competition. The marmosets Callithrix penicillata and Callithrix jacchus and hybrids of these two species have been introduced to privately owned forests in the lowland Atlantic forest of the Rio de Janeiro State in Brazil, the region of occurrence of the endangered golden lion tamarin, Leontopithecus rosalia. Because the ecology and biology of the marmosets and tamarins is similar, there is a reasonable risk that the marmosets would transmit pathogens such as endo parasites. The objective of this study was to identify the helminth fauna present in the introduced marmosets through an analysis of fecal samples of wild caught animals, and to evaluate the parasitological profile according to age, sex and geographical location. Eggs belonging to the Acanthocephala and Nematoda were found in the feces. One nematode egg type was identified as being Primasubulura jacchi. The ocurrence of nematodes was higher in males, acanthocephala were found in all age groups and sexes and P. jacchi was found with higher frequency in adult females. The geographic distribution analysis revealed that some of the forests had a higher predominance of parasites. Little is known about the pathology of parasites in free living Neotropical mammals, and this knowledge would be necessary to infer about the risk (form a parasitological standpoint) that the marmoset presence represents for the survival of the endangered golden lion tamarin.

TI  - The use of T-DNA tagging to isolate mutants of <i>Colletotrichum gloeosporioides</i> and <i>Colletotrichum acutatum</i> with reduced virulence against <i>Hevea brasiliensis</i>
T2  - FOREST PATHOLOGY
AB  - Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation (ATMT) is being increasingly recognized as an effective insertional mutagenesis tool in studies of filamentous fungi for gene discovery and functional analysis. We developed and optimized ATMT for 2 Colletotrichum species, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides and Colletotrichum acutatum, the causative agents of Colletotrichum leaf disease in rubber trees in Southern China. A.tumefaciens strain AGL-1 carrying an ILV1 gene and a green fluorescent protein gene were used to transform the conidia of these 2 Colletotrichum species. The transformation efficiency was correlated with the co-cultivation duration and bacterial cell concentrations, which reached 300-400 transformants per 1x10(6) conidia after optimization. Southern blot analysis indicated that about 60.0% of the C.gloeosporioides transformants and 46.2% of the C.acutatum transformants had a single copy of T-DNA in their genomes. Fungal genomic DNA segments flanking the T-DNA were identified in the transformants through thermal asymmetrical interlaced polymerase chain reaction followed by sequencing. The flanking sequences from 4 C.acutatum and 7 C.gloeosporioides transformants showed moderate or weak homology to the NCBI database entries. Some sequences matching those reported virulence-related genes. The results suggest that the T-DNA inserted mutants banks constructed are useful for the discovery of new or important genes and to elucidate their function in the 2 Colletotrichum species.

TI  - Canine surveillance system for Lyme borreliosis in Wisconsin and northern Illinois: Geographic distribution and risk factor analysis
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - A seroprevalence survey for Borrelia burgdorferi was conducted among the healthy canine pet population in selected counties of Wisconsin and northern Illinois to determine the distribution of Lyme disease and associated risk factors. Information obtained for each dog included place of residence, Lyme disease vaccination status, history of travel and tick exposure, signalment, and medical history. Serum samples were screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and confirmed by an immunoblot procedure. Seroprevalence by county ranged 0-40%, With the highest estimates from west-central Wisconsin. The spatial pattern was significantly correlated with human incidence of Lyme disease and with abundance of the tick vector, Ixodes scapularis. A geographic information system (GIS) was used to integrate environmental data with the location of the residences of the dogs to determine environmental risk factors. Seropositivity among dogs was positively associated with increased tick exposure and time spent outdoors and negatively associated with vaccination against Lyme disease. Seropositivity was also associated with living in forested and urban areas, and on sandy, fertile soils. A canine surveillance system is a useful method for assessing the geographic distribution of Lyme disease, and in combination with a GIS, it can be effective in determining environmental factors associated with I. scapularis endemicity.

TI  - Traditional Uses, Phytochemistry and Biological Activities of <i>Alocasia</i> Species: A Systematic Review
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - The genus Alocasia (Schott) G. Don consists of 113 species distributed across Asia, Southeast Asia, and Australia. Alocasia plants grow in tropical and subtropical forests with humid lowlands. Featuring their large green heart-shaped or arrow-shaped ear leaves and occasionally red-orange fruit, they are very popular ornamental plants and are widely used as traditional medicines to treat various diseases such as jaundice, snake bite, boils, and diabetes. This manuscript critically analysed the distribution, traditional uses, and phytochemical contents of 96 species of Alocasia. The numerous biological activities of Alocasia species were also presented, which include anti-cancer, antidiabetic and antihyperglycaemic, antioxidant, antidiarrhoea, antimicrobial and antifungal, antiparasitic (antiprotozoal and anthelminthic), antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory, brine shrimp lethality, hepatoprotective, anti-hemagglutinin, anti-constipation and diuretic, and radioprotective activities as well as acute toxicity studies. Research articles were acquired by the accessing three scientific databases comprising PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar. For this review, specific information was obtained using the general search term "Alocasia ", followed by the "plant species names " and "phytochemical " or "bioactivity " or "pharmacological activity ". The accepted authority of the plant species was referred from . Scientific studies have revealed that the genus is mainly scattered throughout Asia. It has broad traditional benefits, which have been associated with various biological properties such as cytotoxic, antihyperglycaemic, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory. Alocasia species exhibit diverse biological activities that are very useful for medical treatment. The genus Alocasia was reported to be able to produce a strong and high-quality anti-cancer compound, namely alocasgenoside B, although information on this compound is currently limited. Therefore, it is strongly recommended to further explore the relevant use of natural compounds present in the genus Alocasia, particularly as an anti-cancer agent. With only a few Alocasia species that have been scientifically studied so far, more attention and effort is required to establish the link between traditional uses, active compounds, and pharmacological activities of various species of this genus.

TI  - Sampling methods for phlebotomine sandflies
T2  - MEDICAL AND VETERINARY ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - A review is presented of methods for sampling phlebotomine sandflies (Diptera: Psychodidae). Among similar to 500 species of Phlebotominae so far described, mostly in the New World genus Lutzomyia and the Old World genus Phlebotomus, about 10% are known vectors of Leishmania parasites or other pathogens. Despite being small and fragile, sandflies have a wide geographical range with species occupying a considerable diversity of ecotopes and habitats, from deserts to humid forests, so that suitable methods for collecting them are influenced by environmental conditions where they are sought. Because immature phlebotomines occupy obscure terrestrial habitats, it is difficult to find their breeding sites. Therefore, most trapping methods and sampling procedures focus on sandfly adults, whether resting or active. The diurnal resting sites of adult sandflies include tree holes, buttress roots, rock crevices, houses, animal shelters and burrows, from which they may be aspirated directly or trapped after being disturbed. Sandflies can be collected during their periods of activity by interception traps, or by using attractants such as bait animals, CO2 or light. The method of trapping used should: (a) be suited to the habitat and area to be surveyed, (b) take into account the segment of the sandfly population to be sampled (species, sex and reproduction condition) and (c) yield specimens of appropriate condition for the study objectives (e.g. identification of species present, population genetics or vector implication). Methods for preservation and transportation of sandflies to the laboratory also depend on the objectives of a particular study and are described accordingly.

TI  - <i>Amblyomma aureolatum</i> Genetic Diversity and Population Dynamics Are Not Related to Spotted Fever Epidemiological Scenarios in Brazil
T2  - PATHOGENS
AB  - Regional differences in tick-borne disease epidemiology may be related to biological variations between vector populations. Amblyomma aureolatum (Ixodida: Ixodidae), a neotropical tick, is known from several regions in Brazil. However, only in the metropolitan area of Sao Paulo (SP) state are there studies that establish its role as a vector of a pathogenic rickettsia (Rickettsia rickettsii). The aim of the study was to analyze the genetic diversity, population dynamics, and rickettsia infection in A. aureolatum populations from different spotted fever scenarios in Brazil. Samples were subjected to DNA extraction, amplification and sequencing of 12S rDNA, cytochrome oxidase subunit II and D-loop mitochondrial markers for tick population analyses, and gltA, htrA, ompA, and ompB genes for rickettsia researches. Of the 7-17 tick haplotypes identified, 5-13 were exclusive to each population and 2-12 for each epidemiological scenario, as well as three haplotypes shared by all populations. Amblyomma aureolatum populations are expanding, and do not appear to be genetically structured vis-a-vis the different epidemiological scenarios studied. Rickettsia bellii (in SP) and Rickettsia felis (in Santa Catarina) were identified as infecting A. aureolatum. No relationship between tick haplotypes and rickettsia types were observed.

TI  - Four cases of acute chagasic myocarditis in French Guiana
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - The authors report four cases of acute chagasic myocarditis which had been diagnosed and treated in Cayenne, French Guiana, in the past 6 years. This French territory, which has the highest standard of living in South America, should be considered an area of risk for sporadic Chagas disease with epidemiologic features similar to those of the disease found in dense Amazon forest areas. Appropriate measures must be taken to screen and promptly manage Chagas disease in the French Guiana population.

TI  - Nationwide Investigation of the Pyrethroid Susceptibility of Mosquito Larvae Collected from Used Tires in Vietnam
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Pyrethroid resistance is envisioned to be a major problem for the vector control program since, at present, there are no suitable chemical substitutes for pyrethroids. Cross-resistance to knockdown agents, which are mainly used in mosquito coils and related products as spatial repellents, is the most serious concern. Since cross-resistance is a global phenomenon, we have started to monitor the distribution of mosquito resistance to pyrethroids. The first pilot study was carried out in Vietnam. We periodically drove along the national road from the north end to the Mekong Delta in Vietnam and collected mosquito larvae from used tires. Simplified susceptibility tests were performed using the fourth instar larvae of Aedes aegypti, Aedes albopictus, and Culex quinquefasciatus. Compared with the other species, Ae. aegypti demonstrated the most prominent reduction in susceptibility. For Ae. aegypti, significant increases in the susceptibility indices with a decrease in the latitude of collection points were observed, indicating that the susceptibility of Ae. aegypti against d-allethrin was lower in the southern part, including mountainous areas, as compared to that in the northern part of Vietnam. There was a significant correlation between the susceptibility indices in Ae. aegypti and the sum of annual pyrethroid use for malaria control (1998-2002). This might explain that the use of pyrethroids as residual treatment inside houses and pyrethroid-impregnated bed nets for malaria control is attributable to low pyrethroid susceptibility in Ae. aegypti. Such insecticide treatment appeared to have been intensively administered in the interior and along the periphery of human habitation areas where, incidentally, the breeding and resting sites of Ae. aegypti are located. This might account for the strong selection pressure toward Ae. aegypti and not Ae. albopictus.

TI  - Betulin derivatives impair <i>Leishmania braziliensis</i> viability and host-parasite interaction
T2  - BIOORGANIC & MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY
AB  - Leishmaniasis is a public health problem in tropical and subtropical areas of the world, including Venezuela. The incidence of treatment failure and the number of cases with Leishmania-HIV co-infection underscore the importance of developing alternative, economical and effective therapies against this disease. The work presented here analyzed whether terpenoids derived from betulin are active against New World Leishmania parasites. Initially we determined the concentration that inhibits the growth of these parasites by 50% or IC50, and subsequently evaluated the chemotactic effect of four compounds with leishmanicidal activity in the sub-micromolar and micromolar range. That is, we measured the migratory capacity of Leishmania (V.) braziliensis in the presence of increasing concentrations of compounds. Finally, we evaluated their cytotoxicity against the host cell and their effect on the infectivity of L. (V.) braziliensis. The results suggest that (1) compounds 14, 17, 18, 25 and 27 are active at concentrations lower than 10 mu M; (2) compound 26 inhibits parasite growth with an IC50 lower than 1 mu M; (3) compounds 18, 26 and 27 inhibit parasite migration at pico-to nanomolar concentrations, suggesting that they impair host-parasite interaction. None of the tested compounds was cytotoxic against J774.A1 macrophages thus indicating their potential as starting points to develop compounds that might affect parasite-host cell interaction, as well as being leishmanicidal.

TI  - Cryobiotechnology for the long-term preservation of oak (<i>Quercus</i> sp.) genetic resources
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE III INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON PLANT CRYOPRESERVATION
CP  - 3rd International Symposium on Plant Cryopreservation (CryoSymp)
AB  - Oaks (genus Quercus) are dominant and iconic trees in most European, American, Asian and North African forests, from cool temperate to tropical environments. There are at least 600 species of Quercus globally with high ecological and economical importance. However, 45% of the species evaluated by IUCN are considered threatened, being affected by habitat destruction or diseases and pests, such as acute oak decline or chronic oak dieback in the UK. As a result, conservation of oaks is becoming increasingly important for many countries. Oak seeds are desiccation sensitive (i.e., recalcitrant), and conventional seed bank strategies are not suitable for their long-term preservation. Tissue culture is a useful tool for Quercus species conservation, supporting micropropagation and in vitro conservation. However, cryopreservation is accepted as the most favourable and cost-effective option for oak long-term conservation ex situ. Numerous tissues can be used as germplasm to preserve the genetic diversity of oaks, including winter dormant buds, shoot tips, plumules, embryogenic lines, somatic embryos and embryonic axes. Pollen cryopreservation could also be used as a complementary technology to support conservation and breeding programmes. Interestingly, whilst the seeds of oak are recalcitrant it appears that the pollen has much greater desiccation tolerance. Seed embryonic axes (with shoot and root meristems) are the preferred explants for oak preservation as high genetic diversity can be captured and axes can be grown into full plants with relatively simple micropropagation procedures. However, successful cryopreservation depends on controlling many factors, including physical damage to the embryo during excision, oxidative stress associated to excision and cryopreservation procedures, differential response of shoot and root meristems (within and amongst species) to the stresses imposed by partial desiccation and cooling, and the need to improve in vitro growth and acclimation procedures. Here we review the main cryobiotechnological options for the successful banking of species in the genus Quercus and the needs for future research are highlighted.

TI  - Spatial distribution of anopheline larval habitats in Western Kenyan highlands: Effects of land cover types and topography
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - The distributions of anopheline larval habitats were aggregated in valley bottoms in Kenya in both the rainy and dry seasons, although the degree of aggregation was higher in the dry season than in the rainy season. Larvae of the Anopheles gambiae complex larvae were found more frequently in habitats in farmlands and pastures. However, All, funestus larvae were found more frequently in natural swamps and pastures. Canopy cover was the only variable significantly associated with the occurrence of the An. gambiae complex and An.funestus. The average canopy cover was significantly less in the habitats with the An. gambiae complex and An. funestus larvae than those without the anopheline larvae. Thus, land cover types and topographic features showed important effects on the distribution of anoplieline larval habitats. These results suggest that clearing riparian forests would improve growing conditions of the An. gambiae complex and An. funestus larvae in Kenyan highlands.

TI  - Drainage canal impacts on smoke aerosol emissions for Indonesian peatland and non-peatland fires
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - Indonesia has experienced frequent fires due to the lowering of groundwater levels caused by drainage via extensive canal networks for agricultural development since the 1970s. However, the impact of canals on fire emissions is still poorly understood. Here we investigate canal impacts on smoke aerosol emissions for Indonesian peatland and non-peatland fires by quantifying the resulting changes of smoke aerosol emission coefficient (Ce) that represents total aerosol emissions released from per unit of fire radiative energy. First, we quantified the impacts of canal drainage and backfilling on water table depth (WTD) variations using field data and then expanded such impacts from field to regional scales by correlating field WTD to satellite terrestrial water storage (TWS) anomalies from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment. Second, we estimated Ce from fire radiative power and smoke-aerosol emission rates based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer active fire and multi-angle implementation of atmospheric correction aerosol products. Finally, we evaluated the Ce variation with TWS anomalies. The results indicate: (a) Ce is larger in peatland fires than in non-peatland fires; (b) Ce increases significantly as TWS anomalies decrease for both peatland and non-peatland fires; and (c) Ce changes at nearly twice the rate in peatland for a given TWS anomaly range as in non-peatland. These phenomena likely result from the different fuel types and combustion phases prevalent under different moisture conditions. These findings support the Indonesian government's recent peatland restoration policies and pave the way for improved estimation of tropical biomass burning emissions.

TI  - <i>Leishmania</i> (<i>L</i>.) <i>mexicana</i> Infected Bats in Mexico: Novel Potential Reservoirs
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Leishmania (Leishmania) mexicana causes cutaneous leishmaniasis, an endemic zoonosis affecting a growing number of patients in the southeastern states of Mexico. Some foci are found in shade-grown cocoa and coffee plantations, or near perennial forests that provide rich breeding grounds for the sand fly vectors, but also harbor a variety of bat species that live off the abundant fruits provided by these shade-giving trees. The close proximity between sand flies and bats makes their interaction feasible, yet bats infected with Leishmania (L.) mexicana have not been reported. Here we analyzed 420 bats from six states of Mexico that had reported patients with leishmaniasis. Tissues of bats, including skin, heart, liver and/or spleen were screened by PCR for Leishmania (L.) mexicana DNA. We found that 41 bats (9.77%), belonging to 13 species, showed positive PCR results in various tissues. The infected tissues showed no evidence of macroscopic lesions. Of the infected bats, 12 species were frugivorous, insectivorous or nectarivorous, and only one species was sanguivorous (Desmodus rotundus), and most of them belonged to the family Phyllostomidae. The eco-region where most of the infected bats were caught is the Gulf Coastal Plain of Chiapas and Tabasco. Through experimental infections of two Tadarida brasiliensis bats in captivity, we show that this species can harbor viable, infective Leishmania (L.) mexicana parasites that are capable of infecting BALB/c mice. We conclude that various species of bats belonging to the family Phyllostomidae are possible reservoir hosts for Leishmania (L.) mexicana, if it can be shown that such bats are infective for the sand fly vector. Further studies are needed to determine how these bats become infected, how long the parasite remains viable inside these potential hosts and whether they are infective to sand flies to fully evaluate their impact on disease epidemiology.

TI  - Rapid diagnostic tests and ELISA for diagnosing chronic Chagas disease: Systematic revision and meta-analysis
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Objective
   To determine the diagnostic validity of the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDT) among individuals with suspected chronic Chagas Disease (CD).
   Methodology
   A search was made for studies with ELISA and RDT assays validity estimates as eligibility criteria, published between 2010 and 2020 on PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and LILACS. This way, we extracted the data and assessed the risk of bias and applicability of the studies using the QUADAS-2 tool. The bivariate random effects model was also used to estimate the overall sensitivity and specificity through forest-plots, ROC space, and we visually assessed the heterogeneity between studies. Meta-regressions were made using subgroup analysis. We used Deeks' test to assess the risk of publication bias.
   Results
   43 studies were included; 27 assessed ELISA tests; 14 assessed RDTs; and 2 assessed ELISA and RDTs, against different reference standards. 51.2% of them used a non-comparative observational design, and 46.5% a comparative clinical design ("case-control" type). High risk of bias was detected for patient screening and reference standard. The ELISA tests had a sensitivity of 99% (95% CI: 98-99) and a specificity of 98% (95% CI: 97-99); whereas the Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDT) had values of 95% (95% CI: 94-97) and 97% (95% CI: 96-98), respectively. Deeks' test showed asymmetry on the ELISA assays.
   Conclusions
   ELISA and RDT tests have high validity for diagnosing chronic Chagas disease. The analysis of these two types of evidence in this systematic review and meta-analysis constitutes an input for their use. The limitations included the difficulty in extracting data due to the lack of information in the articles, and the comparative clinical-type design of some studies.

TI  - Correlation between annual activity patterns of venomous snakes and rural people in the Niger Delta, southern Nigeria
T2  - JOURNAL OF VENOMOUS ANIMALS AND TOXINS INCLUDING TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background: Venomous snakes are among the most serious health hazards for rural people in tropical regions of the world. Herein we compare the monthly activity patterns of eight venomous snake species (Elapidae and Viperidae) with those of rural people in the Niger Delta area of southern Nigeria, in order to identify the periods of highest potential risk for persons, and the human group actually at greater risk of snakebite.
   Results: We documented that above-ground activity of all venomous snakes peaked in the wet season, and that high snake activity and high human activity were most highly correlated between April and August. In addition, we documented that women and teenagers were at relatively higher risk of encountering a venomous snake than adult males, despite they are less often in the field than men.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that future programs devoted to mitigate the social and health effects of snakebites in the Niger Delta region should involve especially women and teenagers, with ad-hoc education projects if appropriate. We urge that international organizations working on social and health problems in the developing world, such as IRD, DFID, UNDP, should provide advice through specific programs targeted at especially these categories which have been highlighted in comparatively potential higher threat from snakebites than adult men.

TI  - Population dynamics of an endogenous meiotic drive system in <i>Aedes aegypti</i> in Trinidad
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - An endogenous meiotic drive system was previously reported to be segregating in the yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti L. (Diptera: Culicidae) population in Trinidad. The meiotic driver (M-D) is tightly linked to the male determining locus and selectively targets sensitive responders linked to the female determining allele, causing fragmentation of female gametes. This results in highly male-biased progeny. The M-D system was initially studied as a genetic tool for population control with limited success, but recently interest has focused on its potential for population replacement. This study examines the distribution and dynamics of the M-D system in Trinidad natural populations. We obtained ovitrap samples from seven geographically distinct regions and determined the allele frequencies of the driver (M-D) and sensitive (m(s)) versus insensitive (m(i)) responders, respectively. Frequencies of the M-D allele ranged from 0.1 to 0.5 and were low at the two major port cities, Port of Spain and San Fernando, suggesting the effects of frequent immigration by non-driving genotypes. Frequencies of the m(i) allele ranged from 0.4 to 0.7, suggesting the effects of strong selection by the driver. In addition, our results show that the driver and sensitivity of responders in the Trinidad populations are highly polymorphic. Continued studies of the dynamics of the M-D system in natural populations are critical to considerations of its use in population replacement.

TI  - Asymptomatic Natural Human Infections With the Simian Malaria Parasites Plasmodium cynomolgi and Plasmodium knowlesi
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB  - Background In Southeast Asia, Plasmodium knowlesi, a parasite of long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis), is an important cause of human malaria. Plasmodium cynomolgi also commonly infects these monkeys, but only one naturally acquired symptomatic human case has been reported previously.
   Methods Malariometric studies involving 5422 subjects (aged 6 months to 65 years) were conducted in 23 villages in Pailin and Battambang, western Cambodia. Parasite detection and genotyping was conducted on blood samples, using high-volume quantitative PCR (uPCR).
   Results Asymptomatic malaria parasite infections were detected in 1361 of 14732 samples (9.2%). Asymptomatic infections with nonhuman primate malaria parasites were found in 21 individuals living close to forested areas; P. cynomolgi was found in 11, P. knowlesi was found in 8, and P. vivax and P. cynomolgi were both found in 2. Only 2 subjects were female, and 14 were men aged 20-40 years. Geometric mean parasite densities were 3604 parasites/mL in P. cynomolgi infections and 52488 parasites/mL in P. knowlesi infections. All P. cynomolgi isolates had wild-type dihydrofolate reductase genes, in contrast to the very high prevalence of mutations in the human malaria parasites. Asymptomatic reappearance of P. cynomolgi occurred in 2 subjects 3 months after the first infection.
   Conclusions Asymptomatic naturally acquired P. cynomolgi and P. knowlesi infections can both occur in humans.
   Clinical Trials Registration NCT01872702.
   Epidemiological studies in western Cambodia identified 21 subjects with asymptomatic monkey malaria parasite infections (8 with P. knowlesi infection and 13 with P. cynomolgi infection). These parasites represented 1.9% of all identified malaria parasites.

TI  - Wild and Domestic Canids and Their Interactions in the Transmission Cycles of <i>Trypanosoma Cruzi</i> and <i>Leishmania</i> spp. in an Area of the Brazilian Cerrado
T2  - PATHOGENS
AB  - Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania spp. are parasites that infect multiple hosts including canids, considered bioaccumulators of parasites. Deforestation in the Cerrado biome has resulted in the exposure of wild canids to anthropized areas, where they may establish ecological and epidemiological relationships with domestic dogs. We evaluated the infection by trypanosomatids in canids from a Cerrado agroecosystem between 2013 and 2017. Samples of wild canids (blood, bone marrow and skin) and dogs (blood) were collected for parasitological, serological and molecular diagnosis. A total of 414 samples from wild (n = 131) and domestic (n = 283) canids were collected, including recaptures. We obtained five positive hemocultures from Lycalopex vetulus (n = 2), Cerdocyon thous (n = 1) and dogs (n = 2), all characterized as T. cruzi TcIII/V (18S rDNA) and TcIII/V/VI (gGAPDH); one positive skin fragment for Leishmania sp. (C. thous), one positive skin culture (Chrysocyon brachyurus) and one positive fresh blood examination from a dog. Infection by T. cruzi and Leishmania spp. was serologically confirmed in 18% and 4% of the canids, respectively. Active transmission was attested by seroconversion events and occurred despite the low rate of positive parasitological assays. Wild and domestic canids infected by both parasites were detected sharing the same areas, pointing to a possible spillover of parasites among them.

TI  - Emerging alphaviruses in the Americas: Chikungunya and Mayaro
T2  - REVISTA DA SOCIEDADE BRASILEIRA DE MEDICINA TROPICAL
AB  - Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and Mayaro virus (MAYV) are emergent arthropod-borne viruses that produce outbreaks of acute febrile illness with arthropathy. Despite their different continental origins, CHIKV and MAYV are closely related and are components of the Semliki Forest Complex of the Alphavirus (Togaviridae). MAYV and, more recently, CHIKV, which are both transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, have resulted in severe public health problems in the Americas, including Brazil. In this review, we present aspects of the pathogenesis, clinical presentation and treatment of febrile illnesses produced by CHIKV and MAYV. We also discuss the epidemiological aspects and effects related to the prophylaxis of infections by both viruses.

TI  - Malaria in Gold Miners in the Guianas and the Amazon: Current Knowledge and Challenges
T2  - CURRENT TROPICAL MEDICINE REPORTS
AB  - Purpose of Review Following Paraguay and Argentina, several countries from the Amazon region aim to eliminate malaria. To achieve this, all key affected and vulnerable populations by malaria, including people working on gold mining sites, must be considered. What is the situation of malaria in these particular settings and what are the challenges? This literature review aims to compile knowledge to answer these questions. Recent Findings The contexts in which gold miners operate are very heterogeneous: size and localization of mines, links with crime, administrative status of the mines and of the miners, mobility of the workers or national regulations. The number of malaria cases has been correlated with deforestation (Brazil, Colombia), gold production (Colombia), gold prices (Guyana), or location of the mining region (Peru, Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana). The burden of malaria in gold mines differs between territories: significant in Guyana, French Guiana, or Venezuela; lower in Brazil. AlthoughPlasmodiumvivaxcauses 75% of malaria cases in the Americas,P. falciparumis predominant in several gold mining regions, especially in the Guiana Shield. Because of the remoteness from health facilities, self-medication with under-the-counter antimalarials is frequent. This constitutes a significant risk for the emergence of newP. falciparumparasites resistant to antimalarial drugs. Because of the workers' mobility, addressing malaria transmission in gold mines is essential, not only for miners, but also to prevent the (re-)emergence of malaria. Strategies among these populations should be tailored to the context because of the heterogeneity of situations in different territories. The transnational environment favoring malaria transmission also requires transborder and regional cooperation, where innovative solutions should be considered and evaluated.

TI  - To core, or not to core: the impact of coring on tree health and a best-practice framework for collecting dendrochronological information from living trees
T2  - BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS
AB  - Trees are natural repositories of valuable environmental information that is preserved in the growth and structure of their stems, branches and roots. Dendrochronological analyses, based on the counting, crossdating and characterisation of incrementally formed wood rings, offer powerful insights for diverse fields including ecology, climatology and archaeology. The application of this toolset is likely to increase in popularity over coming decades due to advances in the field and a reduction in the cost of analyses. In research settings where the continued value ofliving trees subject to dendrochronological investigation is important, the use of an increment bore corer to extract trunk tissue is considered the best option to minimise negative impacts on tree health (e.g. stress and fitness). A small and fragmented body of literature, however, reports significant a:tier-effects, and in some cases.fatal outcomes, Irons this sampling technique. As it stands, the literature documenting increment bore coring (IBC) impacts lacks experimental consistency and is poorly replicated, making it difficult for prospective users of the method to assess likely tree responses to coring. This paucity of information has the potential to lead to destructive misuse of the method and also limits its safe implementation in circumstances where the risk of impacts may be appropriate. If IBC is to fulfil its potential as a method of choice across research fields, then we insist first address our limited understanding of IBC impacts and provide a.framework for its appropriate future use. Firstly, we review the historical context of studies examining the impacts of IBC on trees to identify known patterns, focal issues and biases in existing knowledge. IBC wound responses, particularly those that impact on lumber quality, have been the primary focus of prior studies. No universal treatment was identified that conclusively improved wound healing and few studies have linked wound responses to tree health impacts. Secondly, we build on literature insights using a theoretical approach to identify the most important factors to guide future research involving implementation of IBC, including innate tree characteristics and environmental fitctors. Thirdly, we synthesise and interrogate the quantitative data available through meta -analysis to identify risk factors Styr wound reactions. Although poor reporting standards, restricted scopes and a bias towards temperate ecosystems limited quantitative insight, we found that complete cambial wound closure could still harbour high rates of internal trunk decay, and that conditions favouring faster growth generally correlated with reduced indices of internal and external damage in broadleaved taxa. Filially, we propose a framework for guiding best -practice application of IBC to address knowledge gaps and maximise the utility of this method, including standardised reporting indices for identifying and minimising negative impacts on tree health. While IBC is an underutilised tool of ecological enquiry with broad applicability, the method will always incur some risk of negative impacts on the cored tree. We caution that the decision to core, or not to core, must be given careful consideration on a case -by -case basis. In time, we are confident that this choice will be better informed by evidence -based insight.

TI  - Anti-chikungunya virus seroprevalence in Indigenous groups in the Sao Francisco Valley, Brazil
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background Chikungunya fever (CHIKF) is a serious public health problem with a high rate of infection and chronic disabling manifestations that has affected more than 2 million people worldwide since 2005. In spite of this, epidemiological data on vulnerable groups such as Indigenous people are scarce, making it difficult to implement public policies in order to prevent this disease and assist these populations. Objective To describe the serological and epidemiological profile of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in two Indigenous populations in Northeast Brazil, as well as in an urbanized control community, and to explore associations between CHIKV and anthropometric variables in these populations. Methodology/Principal findings This is a cross-sectional ancillary study of the Project of Atherosclerosis among Indigenous Populations (PAI) that included people 30 to 70 years old, recruited from two Indigenous tribes (the less urbanized Fulni-o and the more urbanized Truka people) and an urbanized non-Indigenous control group from the same area. Subjects underwent clinical evaluation and were tested for anti-CHIKV IgG by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Serological profile was described according to ethnicity, sex, and age. The study population included 433 individuals distributed as follows: 109 (25 center dot 2%) Truka, 272 (62 center dot 8%) Fulni-o, and 52 (12%) from the non-Indigenous urbanized control group. Overall prevalence of CHIKV IgG in the study sample was 49.9% (216; 95% CI: 45 center dot 1-54 center dot 7). When the sample was stratified, positive CHIKV IgG was distributed as follows: no individuals in the Truka group, 78 center dot 3% (213/272; 95% CI: 72 center dot 9-83 center dot 1) in the Fulni-o group, and 5.8% (3/52; 95% CI: 1.21-16) in the control group. Conclusions/Significance Positive tests for CHIKV showed a very high prevalence in a traditional Indigenous population, in contrast to the absence of anti-CHIKV serology in the Truka people, who are more urbanized with respect to physical landscape, socio-cultural, and historical aspects, as well as a low prevalence in the non-Indigenous control group, although all groups are located in the same area.
   Author summary Chikungunya fever is a serious public health problem, with a high rate of infection and disease. Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a cosmopolitan virus, which has inflicted severe damage in 50 countries in the Americas and is responsible for chronic disabling manifestations. In spite of this, epidemiological data on vulnerable groups such as Indigenous people are scarce. We report on a cross-sectional study describing the seroprevalence of CHIKV in Indigenous groups in the Sao Francisco Valley, Brazil, in association with anthropometric data. The study population included 433 individuals distributed in the following ethnic groups: 109 (25.2%) Truka, 272 (62 center dot 8%) Fulni-o, and 52 (12%) from the non-Indigenous urbanized control group When the sample was stratified, positive CHIKV IgG was distributed as follows: no individuals in the Truka group, 213/272 (78.3%; 95% CI: 72 center dot 9-83 center dot 1) individuals in the Fulni-o group, and 3/52 (5.8%; 95% CI: 1 center dot 21-16) individuals in the control group. This study shows, for the first time, that CHIKV circulated in an Indigenous population (Fulni-o) in the Sao Francisco Valley, in 2016 and 2017. The finding strikingly differs from the absence of anti-CHIKV serology found in the Truka people and from the low prevalence in the urban region of Juazeiro, Bahia.

TI  - Natural <i>Plasmodium</i> infection in monkeys in the state of Rondonia (Brazilian Western Amazon)
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
AB  - Background: Simian malaria is still an open question concerning the species of Plasmodium parasites and species of New World monkeys susceptible to the parasites. In addition, the lingering question as to whether these animals are reservoirs for human malaria might become important especially in a scenario of eradication of the disease. To aid in the answers to these questions, monkeys were surveyed for malaria parasite natural infection in the Amazonian state of Rondonia, Brazil, a state with intense environmental alterations due to human activities, which facilitated sampling of the animals.
   Methods: Parasites were detected and identified in DNA from blood of monkeys, by PCR with primers for the 18S rRNA, CSP and MSP1 genes and sequencing of the amplified fragments. Multiplex PCR primers for the 18S rRNA genes were designed for the parasite species Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium malariae/Plasmodium brasilianum and Plasmodium simium.
   Results: An overall infection rate of 10.9% was observed or 20 out 184 monkey specimens surveyed, mostly by P. brasilianum. However, four specimens of monkeys were found infected with P. falciparum, two of them doubly infected with P. brasilianum and P. falciparum. In addition, a species of monkey of the family Aotidae, Aotus nigriceps, is firstly reported here naturally infected with P. brasilianum. None of the monkeys surveyed was found infected with P. simium/P. vivax.
   Conclusion: The rate of natural Plasmodium infection in monkeys in the Brazilian state of Rondonia is in line with previous surveys of simian malaria in the Amazon region. The fact that a monkey species was found that had not previously been described to harbour malaria parasites indicates that the list of monkey species susceptible to Plasmodium infection is yet to be completed. Furthermore, finding monkeys in the region infected with P. falciparum clearly indicates parasite transfer from humans to the animals. Whether this parasite can be transferred back to humans and how persistent the parasite is in monkeys in the wild so to be efficient reservoirs of the disease, is yet to be evaluated. Finding different species of monkeys infected with this parasite species suggests indeed that these animals can act as reservoirs of human malaria.

TI  - Slow sand filtration eradicates eucalypt clonal nursery plant pathogens from recycled irrigation water in Brazil
T2  - TROPICAL PLANT PATHOLOGY
AB  - Contaminated irrigation water constitutes one of the main sources of plant pathogens that can cause disease and lead to potentially significant production losses in forest nurseries. Recycling of contaminated irrigation water increases the risk of spreading diseases. The objective of this study was to evaluate a simple slow sand filtration treatment of irrigation water as a method for eradicating fungal and bacterial pathogens in eucalypt cutting nurseries. Pilot filter units were constructed from PVC pipes containing a 80 cm high layer of sand with grain size varying from 0.50 to 0.75 mm, drainage layers of 10 cm of fine gravel (4 mm) followed by a 15 cm layer of coarse gravel (8 mm), connected to a water outlet. The PVC pipe had space for a 150 mm water column above the sand layer and the filter had a flow rate of 100 to 300 L m(-2) h(-1). Eradication of the bacterial pathogen Ralstonia solanacearum, and the fungal pathogens Cylindrocladium candelabrum and Botrytis cinerea through the use of the filter was evaluated. Detection of bacteria in filter-treated irrigation water was performed through the micro drop method followed by PCR of colonies, while fungal pathogens were detected using a castorbean leaf biological bait method. Evaluations were performed daily 35 times for R. solanacearum, 25 times for C. candelabrum and 18 times for B. cinerea during a period of 12 months. After the last evaluation period, samples from various depths of the sand layer in the filters were taken and analyzed for the presence of the plant pathogens. The slow sand filters were able to remove B. cinerea and C. candelabrum spores with 100% efficiency while eradication of R. solanacearum colonies reached up to 99.6%. Colonies of Trichoderma sp. were found predominantly on the all filter layers. The results of this study show that slow sand filters are efficient for recycled water in eucalypt nurseries, especially in eradicating fungal pathogens.

TI  - Epidemiological characteristics and risk factors for cystic and alveolar echinococcosis in China: an analysis of a national population-based field survey
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
AB  - Background Human cystic and alveolar echinococcosis are neglected tropical diseases that WHO has prioritized for control in recent years. Both diseases impose substantial burdens on public health and the socio-economy in China. In this study, which is based on the national echinococcosis survey from 2012 to 2016, we aim to describe the spatial prevalence and demographic characteristics of cystic and alveolar echinococcosis infections in humans and assess the impact of environmental, biological and social factors on both types of the disease.Methods We computed the sex-, age group-, occupation- and education level-specific prevalences of cystic and alveolar echinococcosis at national and sub-national levels. We mapped the geographical distribution of echinococcosis prevalence at the province, city and county levels. Finally, by analyzing the county-level echinococcosis cases combined with a range of associated environmental, biological and social factors, we identified and quantified the potential risk factors for echinococcosis using a generalized linear model.Results A total of 1,150,723 residents were selected and included in the national echinococcosis survey between 2012 and 2016, of whom 4161 and 1055 tested positive for cystic and alveolar echinococcosis, respectively. Female gender, older age, occupation at herdsman, occupation as religious worker and illiteracy were identified as risk factors for both types of echinococcosis. The prevalence of echinococcosis was found to vary geographically, with areas of high endemicity observed in the Tibetan Plateau region. Cystic echinococcosis prevalence was positively correlated with cattle density, cattle prevalence, dog density, dog prevalence, number of livestock slaughtered, elevation and grass area, and negatively associated with temperature and gross domestic product (GDP). Alveolar echinococcosis prevalence was positively correlated with precipitation, level of awareness, elevation, rodent density and rodent prevalence, and negatively correlated with forest area, temperature and GDP. Our results also implied that drinking water sources are significantly associated with both diseases.Conclusions The results of this study provide a comprehensive understanding of geographical patterns, demographic characteristics and risk factors of cystic and alveolar echinococcosis in China. This important information will contribute towards developing targeted prevention measures and controlling diseases from the public health perspective.

TI  - Meristem culture of selected sweet potato (<i>Ipomoea batatas</i> L. Lam.) cultivars to produce virus-free planting material
T2  - JOURNAL OF HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE & BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB  - Sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas L. Lam.) is a staple root crop, consumed as a carbohydrate-rich food source in many tropical countries. The production and productivity of sweet potato is limited by several factors, mainly virus infections. This study was conducted to produce virus-free sweet potato planting material using meristem culture. Meristems without leaf primordia were excised from four virus-positive field-grown local sweet potato cultivars 'Bellela', 'Temesgen', 'LO-323', and 'Zapallo'. Meristems were cultured in Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with different combinations and concentrations of 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP), alpha-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA), and gibberellic acid (GA(3)) for shoot initiation. 'Bellela' and 'Temesgen' exhibited 100% shoot initiation on 5 mg l(-1) BAP, 0.01 mg l(-1) NAA, and 1 mg l(-1) GA(3), although the shoots were bushy. 'LO-323' showed 90% shoot initiation with the best shoot quality on 2 mg l(-1) BAP, 0.01 mg l(-1) NAA, and 1 mg l(-1) GA(3). Shoot tips and nodes from in vitro-grown plantlets were cultured on BAP (0, 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 mg l(-1)) or on BAP (0, 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 mg l(-1)) + kinetin (Kin; 0, 0.1, 0.5 or 1.0 mg l(-1)) for multiple shoot formation. The best shoot proliferation was obtained on MS + 0.5 mg l(-1) BAP + 0.5 mg l(-1) Kin. In vitro-grown shoots were cultured on MS medium containing 0.0, 0.01, 0.1, 0.5, or 1.0 mgl(-1) indole-3-butyric acid (IBA). The best root formation was obtained on IBA-free medium. The plantlets thus produced were tested for the presence of ten sweet potato viruses [Sweet potato chlorotic stunt virus (SPCSV), Sweet potato feathery mottle virus (SPFMV), Sweet potato mild mottle virus (SPMMV), Sweet potato chlorotic fleck virus (SPCFV), Sweet potato caulimo-like virus (SPCaLV), Sweet potato mild speckling virus (SPMSV), C-6 (a flexuous rod virus), Sweet potato latent virus (SwPLV), Sweet potato virus G (SPVG), and Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV)] using nitrocellulose membrane enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (NCM-ELISA). Ninety-nine percent of plantlets were free from all viruses.

TI  - CRlncRC: a machine learning-based method for cancer-related long noncoding RNA identification using integrated features
T2  - BMC MEDICAL GENOMICS
CP  - 29th Internatioinal Conference on Genome Informatics (GIW) - Medical Genomics
AB  - BackgroundLong noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are widely involved in the initiation and development of cancer. Although some computational methods have been proposed to identify cancer-related lncRNAs, there is still a demanding to improve the prediction accuracy and efficiency. In addition, the quick-update data of cancer, as well as the discovery of new mechanism, also underlay the possibility of improvement of cancer-related lncRNA prediction algorithm. In this study, we introduced CRlncRC, a novel Cancer-Related lncRNA Classifier by integrating manifold features with five machine-learning techniques.ResultsCRlncRC was built on the integration of genomic, expression, epigenetic and network, totally in four categories of features. Five learning techniques were exploited to develop the effective classification model including Random Forest (RF), Naive bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). Using ten-fold cross-validation, we showed that RF is the best model for classifying cancer-related lncRNAs (AUC=0.82). The feature importance analysis indicated that epigenetic and network features play key roles in the classification. In addition, compared with other existing classifiers, CRlncRC exhibited a better performance both in sensitivity and specificity. We further applied CRlncRC to lncRNAs from the TANRIC (The Atlas of non-coding RNA in Cancer) dataset, and identified 121 cancer-related lncRNA candidates. These potential cancer-related lncRNAs showed a certain kind of cancer-related indications, and many of them could find convincing literature supports.ConclusionsOur results indicate that CRlncRC is a powerful method for identifying cancer-related lncRNAs. Machine-learning-based integration of multiple features, especially epigenetic and network features, had a great contribution to the cancer-related lncRNA prediction. RF outperforms other learning techniques on measurement of model sensitivity and specificity. In addition, using CRlncRC method, we predicted a set of cancer-related lncRNAs, all of which displayed a strong relevance to cancer as a valuable conception for the further cancer-related lncRNA function studies.

TI  - <i>Rhipicephalus</i> (<i>Boophilus</i>) <i>microplus</i>: Rickettsiae infection in Brazil
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ACAROLOGY
AB  - The tick Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus has been considered a major pest of cattle in tropical regions of the world, inducing significant economic impact on livestock activity. In Brazil, the scenarios of Spotted Fever (SF) epidemic cycles involve Amblyomma sculptum and Amblyomma aureolatum, transmitting Rickettsia rickettsii, as well as Amblyomma ovale, transmitting R. parkeri strain Atlantic Rainforest. However, other potentially pathogenic species of Rickettsia, as well as new species of ticks with vector potential, have been reported for Brazil. Thus, during SF focus investigation and environmental surveillance performed by Brazilian National Network of Environment Surveillance for Tick-borne Diseases between 2011 to 2017, ectoparasites were collected from vertebrate hosts and the environment in rural and urban areas of different Brazilian biomes. Here we analysed Rickettsiae infection in Rh. microplus and possible roles of this tick species in the maintenance and circulation of Rickettsia sp. in SF endemic areas. Cattle tick samples were naturally infected with R. rickettsii, R. parkeri, R. felis, R. tamurae, R. rhipicephali and R. bellii. The data in this study demonstrate that Rh. microplus acquires Rickettsia infection, including pathogenic species, and indicates this tick as suggested marker of Rickettsiae potential presence or circulation.

TI  - Morphometric comparisons of the scanning electron micrographs of the eggs of <i>Anopheles (Nyssorhynchus) darlingi</i> Root (Diptera: Culicidae)
T2  - ACTA TROPICA
AB  - Anopheles darlingi Root is the principal vector of Plasmodium in Brazil, but its biological variability is not well known. Morphometric analyses of scanning electron microscopy images of the eggs of An. darlingi were conducted using individuals collected in nine states of Brazil (Acre, Amapa, Espirito Santo, Para, Parana, Rio de Janeiro, Rondonia, Sao Paulo, and Tocantins). Ten attributes of the eggs (seven continuous variables and three discrete variables) were respectively measured or counted and analyzed to determine if populations from different geographical regions or biomes could be distinguished. Univariate analysis showed that the eggs from Espirito Santo were the narrowest whereas representatives from Tocantins populations had the smallest floats. Results of multivariate analyses of continuous variables showed that the first principal component (PC1), mainly represented by all four float attributes, helped to differentiate populations. The second principal component (PC2) comprised roughly the length and width of the egg. PC1 of discrete variables corresponded to the number of ribs on the float whereas PC2 was approximately equivalent to the number of discs on the micropyle. Based on those variables (continuous and discrete separately), multivariate discriminant analysis indicated that eggs from individuals collected in Tocantins were distinct from the other populations. Among sampled localities, the one from the state of Tocantins was situated within the Cerrado biome whereas the locality from Sao Paulo state was at the border of Cerrado, within a transition zone of the Atlantic Forest biome. Generally, the climate in the Cerrado biome was more arid-than in areas of the Amazon and Atlantic Forest biomes, and the temperature had the highest range. Coincidentally, based on morphometric data, cluster analysis distinguished the population from Cerrado, Tocantins from all other populations. Results of multiple regression analysis of the variables showed no correlation between egg variables and latitude or climatic variables. We concluded that eggs were polymorphic and that some morphological patterns were regional. Although no environmental influence on the egg attributes was unequivocally detected, a potential association cannot be entirely discarded. Consequently, we hypothesize that morphological traits of the immature stages, especially from the eggs, convey evolutionary information regarding to this species. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Review of Biological and Chemical Health Risks Associated with Pork Consumption in Vietnam: Major Pathogens and Hazards Identified in Southeast Asia
T2  - JOURNAL OF FOOD QUALITY
AB  - Foodborne illness is a difficult public health burden to measure, with accurate incidence data usually evading disease surveillance systems. Yet, the global scope of foodborne disease and its impacts on socioeconomic development make it an important health risk to address, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. In Vietnam, rapid development has seen large-scale commercial operations rise to coexist amongst traditional value chains in the food landscape, most of which operates outside of a domestic food safety network. Rapid socioeconomic development has also seen an increase in meat consumption, with pork being the most consumed meat product nationally. Expanding pork value chains, and the increasing diversity of actors within them, facilitates the growth and propagation of hazards which are passed onto Vietnamese consumers. In order to guide illness prevention and governance efforts, this review was conducted to examine health risks associated with pork consumption in Vietnam. Synthesis of the available literature provided evidence that Salmonella spp. bacteria are a major cause of foodborne illness from Vietnamese pork products. However, contaminants of global concern, including Salmonella spp. and Trichinella spiralis, occur alongside those considered neglected tropical diseases, such as Taenia solium. Infections and complications associated with ingestion of Streptococcus suis bacteria are also an issue, with Streptococcus suis infections usually limited to occupational infections amongst meat handlers in modernised value chains. A risk factor underscoring transmission of Trichinella spiralis, Taenia solium, and Streptococcus suis in Vietnam that emerges from the literature is the consumption of dishes containing raw or undercooked pork. Available data indicates that infections associated with raw pork consumption disproportionately affect men and people in regional mountainous areas of northwest Vietnam, where many of Vietnam's ethnic minority communities reside. In addition, epidemiological data from recorded disease outbreaks that result from raw pork consumption demonstrate that these outbreaks usually follow major sociocultural events such as weddings, funerals, and Lunar New Year celebrations. Potential health impacts resulting from residues of antibiotics and heavy metals are also cause for concern, though the direct links between chemical contaminants in food and the development of disease are difficult to conclusively deduce.

TI  - Diversity of Culicidae and Tabanidae (Diptera) and new record of<i>Uranotaenia sapphirina</i>from the archaeological site of X'cambo, Yucatan, Mexico
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TROPICAL INSECT SCIENCE
AB  - Hematophagous flies belonging to the families Culicidae and Tabanidae, have played an important role in human health and domestic/wild and animal health. We performed weekly collections of active-flying flies of dipterans form the families Culicidae and Tabanidae with Malaise, CDC and BG-Sentinel traps during September to October of 2017 among different vegetation types characteristic of the archeological site of X'cambo located at north coast of Yucatan. A total of 656 specimens were collected. Culicidae presented the highest abundance (97.5%) and species richness (73%) in 14 species. The CDC trap was the most effective regarding species richness. Shannon entropy index showed that number of species predicted and observed were not significant among traps. TwoAnophelesand oneAedesspecies were dominant for each trap.Uranotaenia sapphirinais a new record for Yucatan. This information will be valuable for conservation and vector surveillance purposes considering that coastal zones are unique/fragile ecosystems in serious risk of fragmentation and environmental contamination.

TI  - Floral and reproductive biology of the medicinally significant rainforest tree, <i>Fontainea</i> <i>picrosperma</i> (Euphorbiaceae)
T2  - INDUSTRIAL CROPS AND PRODUCTS
AB  - Fontainea picrosperma (Euphorbiaceae) is a dioecious rainforest tree from northern Australia that is of commercial interest following the recent discovery of the putative anti-cancer agent, tigilanol tiglate, in its seed. Production of tigilanol tiglate will rely on purification from harvested fruit and therefore an understanding of the reproductive characteristics that determine fruit set of this species is critical. Most rainforest plant species rely exclusively on animal vectors to transport pollen between plants for successful reproduction. Flower traits and phenology can facilitate sexual reproduction by attracting pollinators whereas failure to attract pollinators can result in low fruit set due to pollen limitation. Here, we describe the floral morphology, flowering phenology and reproductive biology of F. picrosperma. This species bears small, white, actinomorphic flowers with a shallow receptacle. These floral traits are often associated with generalist insect pollination and are common to other dioecious tropical rainforest flowers. Individual female flowers persisted on the tree for several days longer than individual male flowers. Male panicles contained significantly more flowers than female inflorescences, and male flowers opened sequentially on a panicle whereas female flowers opened almost simultaneously within an inflorescence. F. picrosperma was pollen limited, as hand pollinated female flowers produced almost double the final fruit set (39.6 +/- 4.4%) of open pollinated flowers (21.3 +/- 3.4%). Optimised production of tigilanol tiglate may therefore rely on improving pollen flow from male to female trees.

TI  - Pine wilt in meteorological hazard environments
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
AB  - Environment plays an important role in the interaction between host and pathogen and in the expression of diseases. Climatic differences among East Asia, Eastern USA, the Mediterranean and Northern Europe were compared against differences in the prevalence of pine wilt disease. This disease was prevalent in East Asia where there are frequent summer droughts and typhoons. Northern Europe (EEM) has a mild climate with very few summer droughts and tropical cyclone impacts and no pine wilt disease. The Mediterranean occasionally suffers climatic extremes, and pine wilt disease occurs infrequently and in localized area. The Eastern USA has climatic variability intermediate between Northern Europe and East Asia. Hurricanes are fewer and weaker compared to typhoons in Japan, China and Korea. Pine wilt disease occurs only in exotic pines in the USA. The climate of Hokkaido in Japan, where there is no pine wilt disease, is similar to that of the Eastern USA. With special stress adaptability, pines (Pinus spp.) usually respond to the meteorological extremes entirely and excrete large amount of resin. Disturbing by the hazardous summer drought and strong rainless typhoons (foehn-like typhoon), water and energy imbalance of pines often occurred so as to halt the resin excretion and trigger them into wilt.

TI  - Comparative Performance of Chemical and Biological-based Products in Management of Algal Leaf Spot on Magnolia
T2  - HORTTECHNOLOGY
AB  - Magnolia trees (Magnolia sp.) are a popular choice for consumers when choosing flowering woody plants for landscapes. Magnolia species grow in a wide variety of both temperate and tropical locations. Southern magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora) is one of the more popular magnolias due to its pleasing aesthetics: large showy flowers in a range of colors and evergreen foliage. However, magnolias can be affected by algal leaf spot. Algal leaf spot is caused by Cephaleuros virescens, which is a widespread plant parasitic green alga. There has been little research on how to treat algal leaf spot on magnolia plants. This study focuses on identifying effective biological- and chemical-based fungicides for the management of algal leaf spot disease of magnolia plants. Two experiments were conducted in a randomized complete block design with six replications per treatment and a total of 12 treatments, including a nontreated control. The first experiment (Expt. 1) was conducted in a shade house (56% shade) at McMinnville, TN, using southern magnolia plants. The second experiment (Expt. 2) was conducted at a commercial nursery in McMinnvillle, TN, in a field plot planted with 'Jane' magnolia (Magnolia liliiflora `Nigra' x Magnolia stellata `Rosea'). The algal leaf spot disease severity, disease progression, plant marketability and growth parameters were evaluated. In both experiments, all treatments reduced algal leaf spot disease severity and disease progress in comparison with the nontreated control. In Expt. 1, copper octanoate, copper oxychloride, chlorothalonil water-dispersible granules, chlorothalonil suspension concentrate, didecyl dimethyl ammonium chloride, azoxystrobin + benzovindiflupyr, hydrogen peroxide + peroxyacetic acid, and mono- and dipotassium salts of phosphorus acid + hydrogen peroxide reduced the disease severity and disease progress the most and were not statistically different from one another. In Expt. 2, azoxystrobin + benzovindiflupyr, didecyl dimethyl ammonium chloride, and copper oxychloride significantly reduced disease severity and disease progress (area under disease progress curve). Treatments had no deleterious effect on plant growth parameters such as height and width, and no phytotoxicity of applied treatments or defoliation was observed. Treated magnolia plants had better plant marketability compared with the nontreated control plants. The findings of this study will help growers to achieve better management of algal leaf spot disease on magnolia trees.

TI  - Locally optimized separability enhancement indices for urban land cover mapping: Exploring thermal environmental consequences of rapid urbanization in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Landsat data were used to assess urbanization-induced dynamics in Land use/cover (LULC), surface thermal intensity, and its relationships with urban biophysical composition. The study was undertaken in Addis Ababa city, Ethiopia. Ground-based data and high resolution images were used as reference data in LULC classification. To more accurately quantify landscape patterns and their changes, we applied new locally optimized separability enhancement indices and decision rules (SEI-DR approach) to address commonly observed classification accuracy problems in urban environments. We tested the SEI-DR approach using eight Landsat images acquired between 1985 and 2010. Two approaches were applied to quantify surface heat intensity (SHIn) and to examine its spatial patterns over 25 years: thermal gradient analysis and hot spot analysis. A Simultaneous Autoregressive Spatial error model (SARerr) was used to explore relationships between surface temperature and biophysical variables describing urban surfaces. Compared to Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification, accuracy improvement achieved through use of the SEI-DR procedure was, respectively, 6% and 5% and the differences were statistically significant (P < 0.05). The Surface Heat Intensity (SHIn) analysis showed increasing contrast (1985-2010) between urban centers and the outskirt. On average, outskirts were cooler than central urban areas by up to 3.7 degrees C. We detected statistically significant differences in intra-urban thermal aggregation (P < 0.01) and the differences ranged from 4.4 degrees C to 5.3 degrees C. Increasing heat intensity was observed between 1985 and 2010. However, we observed no clear evidence of urban areas being warmer than rural. Built-up surfaces and bare soil showed similar positive relationships with surface temperature (P < 0.01), while vegetation showed a negative relationship (P < 0.05). We conclude that with rapid urbanization, thermal intensity increased but relationships with vegetation suggest that options for mitigating urban warming in tropical climates may be available. The development of a new urban classification method, use of hotspot analysis, and the investigations of the UHI for an African city fill important research gaps for studies of urban thermal variation.

TI  - Bacterial Community Shifts during Polyp Bail-Out Induction in <i>Pocillopora</i> Corals
T2  - MICROBIOLOGY SPECTRUM
AB  - Polyp bail-out constitutes both a stress response and an asexual reproductive strategy that potentially facilitates dispersal of some scleractinian corals, including several dominant reef-building taxa in the family Pocilloporidae. Recent studies have proposed that microorganisms may be involved in onset and progression of polyp bail-out. However, changes in the coral microbiome during polyp bail-out have not been investigated. In this study, we induced polyp bail-out in Pocillopora corals using hypersaline and hyperthermal methods. Bacterial community dynamics during bail-out induction were examined using the V5-V6 region of the 16S-rRNA gene. From 70 16S-rRNA gene libraries constructed from coral tissues, 1,980 OTUs were identified. Gammaproteobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria consistently constituted the dominant bacterial taxa in all coral tissue samples. Onset of polyp bail-out was characterized by increased relative abundance of Alphaproteobacteria and decreased abundance of Gammaproteobacteria in both induction experiments, with the shift being more prominent in response to elevated temperature than to elevated salinity. Four OTUs, affiliated with Thalassospira, Marisediminitalea, Rhodobacteraceae, and Myxococcales, showed concurrent abundance increases at the onset of polyp bail-out in both experiments, suggesting potential microbial causes of this coral stress response.IMPORTANCE Polyp bail-out represents both a stress response and an asexual reproductive strategy with significant implications for reshaping tropical coral reefs in response to global climate change. Although earlier studies have suggested that coral-associated microbiomes likely contribute to initiation of polyp bail-out in scleractinian corals, there have been no studies of coral microbiome shifts during polyp bail-out. In this study, we present the first investigation of changes in bacterial symbionts during two experiments in which polyp bail-out was induced by different environmental stressors. These results provide a background of coral microbiome dynamics during polyp bail-out development. Increases in abundance of Thalassospira, Marisediminitalea, Rhodobacteraceae, and Myxococcales that occurred in both experiments suggest that these bacteria are potential microbial causes of polyp bail-out, shedding light on the proximal triggering mechanism of this coral stress response.

T2  - TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - To reach the ambitious WHO TB global targets by 2035, it is likely that China will need a comprehensive strategy that builds on its existing high-quality directly observed treatment, short-course program. This will require optimizing the use of existing tools within a changing health system landscape. In addition, new tools are needed to identify and treat TB in high-risk groups and in older people, who are a growing driver of disease incidence. Lastly, strategies are needed to address the proximate risk factors and social determinants that underlie trends in TB burden.

TI  - Avian host composition, local speciation and dispersal drive the regional assembly of avian malaria parasites in South American birds
T2  - MOLECULAR ECOLOGY
AB  - Identifying the ecological factors that shape parasite distributions remains a central goal in disease ecology. These factors include dispersal capability, environmental filters and geographic distance. Using 520 haemosporidian parasite genetic lineages recovered from 7,534 birds sampled across tropical and temperate South America, we tested (a) the latitudinal diversity gradient hypothesis and (b) the distance-decay relationship (decreasing proportion of shared species between communities with increasing geographic distance) for this host-parasite system. We then inferred the biogeographic processes influencing the diversity and distributions of this cosmopolitan group of parasites across South America. We found support for a latitudinal gradient in diversity for avian haemosporidian parasites, potentially mediated through higher avian host diversity towards the equator. Parasite similarity was correlated with climate similarity, geographic distance and host composition. Local diversification in Amazonian lineages followed by dispersal was the most frequent biogeographic events reconstructed for haemosporidian parasites. Combining macroecological patterns and biogeographic processes, our study reveals that haemosporidian parasites are capable of circumventing geographic barriers and dispersing across biomes, although constrained by environmental filtering. The contemporary diversity and distributions of haemosporidian parasites are mainly driven by historical (speciation) and ecological (dispersal) processes, whereas the parasite community assembly is largely governed by host composition and to a lesser extent by environmental conditions.

TI  - HbLFG1, a Rubber Tree (<i>Hevea brasiliensis</i>) Lifeguard Protein, Can Facilitate Powdery Mildew Infection by Suppressing Plant Immunity
T2  - PHYTOPATHOLOGY
AB  - Powdery mildew causes substantial losses in crop and economic plant yields worldwide. Although powdery mildew infection of rubber trees (Hevea brasiliensis), caused by the biotrophic fungus Erysiphe quercicola, severely threatens natural rubber production, little is known about the mechanism by which E. quercicola adapts to H. brasiliensis to invade the host plant. In barley and Arabidopsis thaliana, lifeguard (LEG) proteins, which have topological similarity to BAX LNHIBITOR-1, are involved in host plant susceptibility to powdery mildew infection. In this study, we characterized an H. brasiliensis LFG protein (HbLFG1) with a focus on its function in regulating defense against powdery mildew. HbLFGI gene expression was found to be upregulated during E. quercicola infection. HbLFG1 showed conserved functions in cell death inhibition and membrane localization. Expression of HbLFGI in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves and A. thaliana Col-0 was demonstrated to significantly suppress callose deposition induced by conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns chitin and flg22. Furthermore, we found that overexpression of HbLFG1 in H. brasiliensis mesophyll protoplasts significantly suppressed the chitin-induced burst of reactive oxygen species. Although A. thaliana Col-0 and E. quercicola displayed an incompatible interaction, Col-0 transformants overexpressing HbLFG1 were shown to be susceptible to E. quercicola. Collectively, the findings of this study provide evidence that HbLFG1 acts as a negative regulator of plant immunity that facilitates E. quercicola infection in H. brasiliensis.

T2  - TROPICAL VETERINARY DISEASES: CONTROL AND PREVENTION IN THE CONTEXT OF THE NEW WORLD ORDER
CP  - 5th Biennial Conference of the Society-for-Tropical-Veterinary-Medicine
AB  - A study of ticks associated with wild animals was carried out from September 1996 to April 1998 at the Fazenda Alegria (21,000 ha), in the Nhecolandia Pantanal, State of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil, a sunken plain bordering the upper Paraguay river, located 19 x 08'S; 56 x 46'W. A total of 81 wild animals (13 species, 6 orders) were captured with the aid of nets, and ticks were found on 63 (78%). Tick species identified included Boophilus microplus (Canestrini), Amblyomma cajennense (F.), A. parvum (Aragao), A. pseudo-concolor (Aragao), A. scalpturatum (Neumann), A. nodosum (Neumann), A. ovale (Koch), and A. tigrinum (Koch). Dragging from grasslands (campos) yielded negative results compared to the high concentration of ticks, mainly nymphs, that were collected from leaves in the forests (capao). Predominance of immature instars (Amblyomma genera) was observed in the end of winter (August-September). Ticks were associated mainly with coatis, deer (Mazama gouazoubira) and anteater, and these animals may play a role in the epidemiology of tick-transmitted pathogens in the Pantanal if one considers their coexistence with local domestic animals.

TI  - Estimation of leaf wetness duration using empirical models in northwestern Costa Rica
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
AB  - Leaf wetness duration (LWD) estimation models developed in the midwestern U.S. were assessed for portability to northwestern Costa Rica during wet and dry seasons. The CART/SLD/Wind (CART) model overestimated LWD by 5.4 h at five sites in northwestern Costa Rica during the 1999 wet season. The Fuzzy (FL) model, in contrast, estimated LWD at the same sites within 3 h. During the 2000-2001 and 2002-2003 dry seasons, both models underestimated LWD at most sites, probably due to the prevalence of less humid conditions than in the temperate climate of the midwestern U.S. However, accuracy of the FL model was substantially improved when a correction factor was utilized during the 2002-2003 dry season, indicating that this model could be adjusted to estimate LWD in a semi-arid climate with acceptable accuracy. The results suggested that the adjusted FL model could estimate LWD accurately in other tropical regions with climate regimes similar to northwestern Costa Rica. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Microbiota, pathogens, and parasites as mediators of tritrophic interactions between insect herbivores, plants, and pollinators
T2  - JOURNAL OF INVERTEBRATE PATHOLOGY
AB  - Insect-associated microbes, including pathogens, parasites, and symbionts, influence the interactions of herbivorous insects and pollinators with their host plants. Moreover, herbivory-induced changes in plant resource allocation and defensive chemistry can influence pollinator behavior. This suggests that the outcomes of interactions between herbivores, their microbes and host plants could have implications for pollinators. As epizootic diseases occur at high population densities, pathogen and parasite-mediated effects on plants could have landscape-level impacts on foraging pollinators. The goal of this minireview is to highlight the potential for an herbivore's multitrophic interactions to trigger plant-mediated effects on the immunity and health of pollinators. We highlight the importance of plant quality and gut microbiomes in bee health, and how caterpillars as model herbivores interact with pathogens, parasites, and symbionts to affect plant quality, which forms the centerpiece of multitrophic interactions between herbivores and pollinators. We also discuss the impacts of other herbivore-associated factors, such as agricultural inputs aimed at decreasing herbivorous pests, on pollinator microbiomes.

TI  - Modeling of impact assessment of super cyclone Amphan with machine learning algorithms in Sundarban Biosphere Reserve, India
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
AB  - Coastal areas play an important role in the global food and economic system, but are vulnerable to a number of coastal hazards such as cyclones and storm surges. The Sundarban Biosphere Reserve (SBR) is located on the east coast of India and has a rich diversity of aquatic and terrestrial flora and fauna. The region is frequently affected by coastal hazards such as cyclones and storm surges. The objective of this study is to investigate the impact of Super Cyclone Amphan on land use land cover (LULC) in SBR. For this purpose, the land use land cover (LULC) map of the study area before and after the cyclone was first constructed using four machine learning algorithms: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Spectral Angle Mapper and Maximum Likelihood Classifier. In addition, the accuracy of these methods was evaluated using the confusion matrix. The result shows that the SVM basis provides better accuracy than the other methods. After evaluating the accuracy, the detection of changes in the LULC was analysed. The result shows that forest cover in the region decreased significantly (about 38.8%) due to super cyclone Amphan. In addition, agricultural land, swamps, sandbanks and beaches increased by 49.51%, 39.57%, 17.40% and 6.93% respectively. The findings of this study can be used by local and state disaster management authorities to prepare the effective disaster management plans for the region.

T2  - MYCOSCIENCE
AB  - We studied the spatio-temporal patterns in two fungal pathogens, Sporisorium kusanoi, along with Naemacyclus culmigenus, of the Japanese pampas grass (Miscanthus sinensis) in grassland communities on the Sugadaira plateau, Japan. Their disease symptoms emerged early in June, increased rapidly during the month and peaked early in July. We checked their presence at 11 sites (the regional-scale census) and recorded their presence in 6000 1 x 1-m subplots within a 60 x 100-m area at the specific site (the local-scale census). Sporisorium kusanoi and N. culmigenus were observed at eight and one sites in the regional-scale census, and in 987 and 2708 subplots in the local-scale census, respectively. The respective spatial distributions of S. kusanoi and N. culmigenus aggregated at the spatial scales of 13 m and 33 m. However, the spatial positions of the two fungi were slightly repulsive each other. Our results found that S. kusanoi was widely distributed within the region, whereas N. culmigenus was restricted within the specific site but had a higher frequency compared to S. kusanoi. The contrasting spatial patterns of the two pathogens may reflect differences in their dispersal processes. (C) 2014 The Mycological Society of Japan. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Molecular Mechanisms of <i>In vitro</i> Betulin-Induced Apoptosis of <i>Leishmania donovani</i>
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Although leishmanial infections of humans occur globally, the major health impact lies in developing nations, thus, leishmaniases remain "neglected" diseases for new drugs development. Multidrug resistance has been documented in most countries where leishmaniases is endemic. Betulin is a widely available and affordable natural product exerting leishmanicidal activity at micromolar concentration. In this study, the molecular mechanisms of death that contribute to the anti-leishmanial activity of betulin are investigated. In promastigotes, betulin stimulated reactive oxygen species generation at micromolar concentrations in Leishmania. Apoptosis was observed in betulin-treated promastigotes using flow cytometric analysis of treated cells stained with annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide. Furthermore, betulin treatment of promastigotes led to mitochondrial membrane damage, activation of caspase-like proteases, and DNA fragmentation in Leishmania donovani promastigotes. Betulin treatment of amastigotes cultured within macrophages, resulted in a reduced number of amastigotes, with no substantive cytotoxic damage to the host macrophage cells at leishmanicidal drug concentrations.

TI  - Characterization of Sunn Hemp Witches' Broom Phytoplasma in Myanmar
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE FACULTY OF AGRICULTURE KYUSHU UNIVERSITY
AB  - Sunn hemp is a tropical or subtropical plant of the legume family, and used as green manure and lignified fiber. Chlorotic leaves, internodes shortening, reduced sized leaves and shoot proliferation symptoms were observed on sunn hemp in a number of fields around Yezin area, Myanmar. To determine possible association of a phytoplasma with the disease, DNA amplifications were conducted by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using a universal phytoplasma primer pair, SN910601/SN011119 that amplified 1.8 kb fragments encoding the entire 16S rDNA, the 16S-23S intergenic spacer region and the beginning of 23S rDNA. Phytoplasmal rDNA was amplified in the PCR, indicating that phytoplasma was associated with the disease and designated sunn hemp witches' broom (ShWB) phytoplasma. On the basic of nucleotide sequence analysis of 16S rDNA and phylogenetic analysis, the ShWB phytoplasma was closely related to strains SUNHP from diseased sunn hemp in Thailand which are classified in 16SrII group. Results of putative restriction fragment length polymorphism maps showed that the ShWB phytoplasma belonged to subgroup 16SrII A. This report is the first observation and molecular characterization on sunn hemp witches' broom phytoplasma in Myanmar.

TI  - First report of the signal fly, <i>Scholastes</i> sp (Diptera: Platystomatidae) visiting animal carcasses in Malaysia
T2  - TROPICAL BIOMEDICINE
AB  - Signal fly, Scholastes sp. (Diptera: Platystomatidae) was observed associated with animal carcasses in Malaysia. The first observation was on a monkey carcass, which was killed by using a handgun and immediately placed in a forested area in Gombak, Selangor while the second observation was on a pig that died of natural causes and whose carcass was placed in an oil palm plantation in Tanjung Sepat, Selangor. Both animal carcasses were visited by Scholastes sp. flies during the fresh decomposition period. However, the role Scholastes flies in the decomposition process remains unknown. In this paper, we report the occurrence of Scholastes sp. on animal carcasses in Malaysia for the first time.

TI  - A metagenomic survey of soil microbial communities along a rehabilitation chronosequence after iron ore mining
T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
AB  - Microorganisms are useful environmental indicators, able to deliver essential insights to processes regarding mine land rehabilitation. To compare microbial communities from a chronosequence of mine land rehabilitation to pre-disturbance levels from references sites covered by native vegetation, we sampled non-rehabilitated, rehabilitating and reference study sites from the Urucum Massif, Southwestern Brazil. From each study site, three composed soil samples were collected for chemical, physical, and metagenomics analysis. We used a paired-end library sequencing technology (NextSeq 500 Illumina); the reads were assembled using MEGAHIT. Coding DNA sequences (CDS) were identified using Kaiju in combination with non-redundant NCBI BLAST reference sequences containing archaea, bacteria, and viruses. Additionally, a functional classification was performed by EMG v2.3.2. Here, we provide the raw data and assembly (reads and contigs), followed by initial functional and taxonomic analysis, as a base-line for further studies of this kind. Further investigation is needed to fully understand the mechanisms of environmental rehabilitation in tropical regions, inspiring further researchers to explore this collection for hypothesis testing.

TI  - Bioprospection for new larvicides against <i>Aedes aegypti</i> based on ethnoknowledge from the Amazonian Sao Sebastiao de Marinau riverside community
T2  - JOURNAL OF ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY
AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Vector-borne diseases represent a huge global burden impacting health systems. Aedes aegypti is the main vector of arboviral diseases including dengue, Zika, chikungunya and urban yellow fever in both tropical and subtropical areas. Ethnopharmacological investigations provide potential avenues for developing new vector control strategies.
   Aim of the study: The objective of this study is to document the Sa tilde o Sebastia tilde o de Marinau riverside community's ethnoknowledge of local plants used to control mosquitoes and perform bioguided fractionation to isolate the compounds active against the arboviral disease vector Ae. aegypti.Materials and methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with residents of the Marinau community located in the Caxiuana tilde National Forest, in the Amazon biome, Par acute accent a, Brazil. The plants used to control mosquitoes were subjected to phytochemical studies guided by Ae. aegypti assays. Extracts were obtained from seven species using distinct organic solvents. Active extracts and fractions were separated by chromatographic techniques. Isolated compounds were characterized by NMR, LC/MS and GC/MS. Sample activity against Ae. aegypti larvae and pupae was evaluated after 24, 48 and 72 h exposure. The extracts were also investigated against adult female mosquitoes. The LC50 values were determined by diluting each sample to obtain different concentrations in the respective activity range.
   Results: The Marinau community uses more than ten plants as a repellent, most of which are trees native to the region. The primary applications of these plants to protect against insect bites were: burning plants (fumigation), application of body oils and bathing in macerated plants. Carapa guianensis is the predominant species used as a repellent. Extracts from Diospyros guianensis fruits, Carapa guianensis seed shells and Aspidosperma nitidum wood demonstratedAe. aegypti larvicidal activity. The C. guianensis seed shell extract demonstrated a residual larvicidal effect. Plumbagin, stigmasterol, beta-sitosterol, betulinic, ursolic and oleanolic acids, and betulin were identified in the D. guianensis extract. The plumbagin, ursolic and oleanolic acids displayed larvicidal activity. Oleanolic, ursolic and betulinic acids, and betulin were considered pupicidal. Aricine, the major alkaloid isolated from A. nitidum wood, also presented larvicidal activity.
   Conclusions: Ten plant species traditionally used by the Marinau community to afford protection against mosquitoes were reported. C. guianensis, D. guianensis and A. nitidum extracts were considered larvicidal against Ae. aegypti. Four triterpenes stood out as very active compounds against pupae. Aricine, an indole alkaloid, displayed larvicidal activity. Therefore, traditional knowledge of Amazonian plants combined with bioguided fractionation constitutes a strategy for the development of eco-friendly insecticides to control Ae. aegypti, an arbovirus vector.

TI  - Redescription of the adult stages of <i>Ixodes (Afrixodes)</i> <i>rasus</i> Neumann 1899, with notes on its phylogenetic position within the genus <i>Ixodes</i>
T2  - TICKS AND TICK-BORNE DISEASES
AB  - The tick subgenus Afrixodes Morel 1966 (Ixodidae) is distributed in sub-Saharan Africa. It consists of about 60 species which are described based on a few specimens and/or only some developmental stages, mostly adults. Because of this, the diagnosis of the African species of Ixodes is in many aspects complicated. Ixodes rasus Neumann 1899 is a common species, widely distributed in tropical and subtropical moist broadleaved forests in central Africa, whose morphology remains poorly described. We redescribe the adults of the species and provide molecular data for 16S rDNA based on three questing females and one male collected in the Central African Republic. Both sexes have an anal groove rounded and closed. The female has syncoxae on coxae I to III, a dental formula of 2/2, and long, curved auriculae. The male has moderate syncoxae on coxae I-III, coxae I-II carry one single internal spur each: coxae III and IV unarmed. The cornua are absent in the male, and the auriculae are small lobes. The male pregenital plate is longer than broad, with an anterior margin widely rounded; the median plate is large and clearly divergent posteriorly, with adanal plates fused posteriorly to the anus, and a dental formula of 4/4 (one row of 5/5). The molecular features of 16S rDNA place I. rasus near I. aulacodi (the only other Afrixodes species for which 16S rDNA is available) and near I. turdus and I. frontalis; two species of ticks of the Palearctic region, which commonly infest birds. The paucity of data regarding the subgenus Afrixodes makes it necessary to provide reliable and comparable re-descriptions of several species, as well as description of the immature stages for many of the currently known taxa.

T2  - TROPICAL BIOMEDICINE
AB  - A study on insect succession of monkey carcass in a forested area in Ulu Gombak, Selangor, Malaysia was conducted from 9 May to 18 June 2007. The third instal: of the housefly, Musca domestica (Linnaeus) (Diptera: Muscidae) were only found on dry stage at a decomposed (Day-33) monkey carcass (Macaca fascicularis Raffles). This observation revealed that M. domestica maggots were found together with other muscid fly maggots, Hydrotaea (=Ophyra) spinigera (Stein) (Diptera: Muscidae) on dry stage of a carcass. However, the role of M. domestica on forensic entomological study remains unknown. This study recorded the first finding of M. domestica maggots on primate carcass in Malaysia.

TI  - Short Report: Maripa Hantavirus in French Guiana: Phylogenetic Position and Predicted Spatial Distribution of Rodent Hosts
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - A molecular screening of wild-caught rodents was conducted in French Guiana, South America to identify hosts of the hantavirus Maripa described in 2008 in a hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) case. Over a 9-year period, 418 echimyids and murids were captured. Viral RNA was detected in two sigmodontine rodents, Oligoryzomys fulvescens and Zygodontomys brevicauda, trapped close to the house of a second HPS case that occurred in 2009 and an O. fulvescens close to the fourth HPS case identified in 2013. Sequences from the rodents had 96% and 97% nucleotide identity (fragment of S and M segments, respectively) with the sequence of the first human HPS case. Phylogenetic reconstructions based on the complete sequence of the S segment show that Maripa virus is closely related to Rio Mamore hantavirus. Using environmental descriptors of trapping sites, including vegetation, landscape units, rain, and human disturbance, a maximal entropy-based species distribution model allowed for identification of areas of higher predicted occurrence of the two rodents, where emergence risks of Maripa virus are expected to be higher.

TI  - Whole genome sequencing of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>: current standards and open issues
T2  - NATURE REVIEWS MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis has rapidly progressed from a research tool to a clinical application for the diagnosis and management of tuberculosis and in public health surveillance. This development has been facilitated by drastic drops in cost, advances in technology and concerted efforts to translate sequencing data into actionable information. There is, however, a risk that, in the absence of a consensus and international standards, the widespread use of WGS technology may result in data and processes that lack harmonization, comparability and validation. In this Review, we outline the current landscape of WGS pipelines and applications, and set out best practices for M. tuberculosis WGS, including standards for bioinformatics pipelines, curated repositories of resistance-causing variants, phylogenetic analyses, quality control and standardized reporting.

TI  - VERIFICATION OF TOLERANCE TO INFECTION BY<i> CERATOCYSTIS</i> MANGINECANS IN CLONES OF ACACIA MANGIUM
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL FOREST SCIENCE
AB  - Ceratocystis canker and wilt disease has had a devastating impact on plantations of Acacia mangium in Sabah, Malaysia effectively resulting in its discontinuation in the region. The immediate future of industrial tree plantations in Malaysia relies on alternative species, such as Eucalyptus pellita, which are suited to the environment and market opportunities. However, identifying A. mangium planting stock with high levels of tolerance to Ceratocystis manginecans provides substantial opportunities for its large scale planting and sustainability in the future. The aim of this study was to verify tolerance to C. manginecans in over 100 putatively tolerant A. mangium clones selected from a family screening trial consisting of 100 wild families. Selections from the family screening trial were based on either short-lesion length measured six weeks after inoculation or survival 12 months post inoculation. Six clonal trials were established under field conditions over two years with more than five ramets of most clones tested in at least two separate trials. The trees were inoculated with C. manginecans 12 months after trial establishment, and assessments of crown health and survival as well as the presence or absence of sunken bark, gummosis or stem borer infestation were carried out 12 months post inoculation. Narrow-sense heritability estimates were moderate for external variables and for crown health (0.14-0.24) and survival (0.14-0.22). Genetic correlation estimates between trials were generally high, indicating that assessments were repeatable across trials. Correlations between traits used to assess damage following inoculation indicated that different traits may be used to identify clones that tolerate infection. The accuracy of the screening showed that resistant clones can be identified and used to produce A. mangium tolerant to infection by C. manginecans.

TI  - Therapeutic drug monitoring of benznidazole and nifurtimox: a systematic review and quality assessment of published clinical practice guidelines
T2  - REVISTA DA SOCIEDADE BRASILEIRA DE MEDICINA TROPICAL
AB  - The pharmacological management of adults with chronic-phase Chagas disease is challenging despite it being the recent focus of extensive research. One of the challenges in the current clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) landscape is the existence of non-evidence-based recommendations for the use of laboratory tests in treatment monitoring. This study aimed to systematically assess the quality and consistency of recommendations of CPGs on the pharmacological management of adults with chronicphase Chagas disease. Systematic literature searches were conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, SciELO and Google to identify all published CPGs relevant to the pharmacological management of Chagas disease, between January 2010 and March 2016. Three independent reviewers assessed the quality of each CPG using the Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II instrument. A total of five CPGs were included and the overall quality of the guidelines for therapeutic drug monitoring of Chagas disease was moderate-to-low. There was considerable variation in the quality of the CPGs across the AGREE II domains. The domains of scope/purpose, stakeholder involvement, and clarity of presentation were rated well, and the domains of applicability and editorial independence received poor ratings. This review showed that the methodological quality of CPGs for Chagas disease was generally inappropriate, and there was no explicit link between the best available evidence and current recommendations.

TI  - Effect of cropping system, shade cover and altitudinal gradient on coffee yield components at Mt. Elgon, Uganda
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Coffee is a key export commodity of East Africa, but average smallholders' yields are low. To guide sustainable yield improvements of smallholders' coffee systems, we investigated coffee yield components in three different types of coffee cropping systems along an altitude gradient (1100 - 2100 m.a.s.l.) during two production years (2015 and 2016). We selected 810 coffee trees distributed over 27 farms and monitored number of stems per tree, fruit load per branch, productive nodes per branch (on four branches of one stem per tree) and number of productive branches per stem (on one stem per selected tree) in both years. Additionally, we monitored productive stems per ha, coffee tree density and cherry weight in combination with pest and disease occurrence and management information from interviews. Coffee farms were classified as Coffee-Open (CO) (< 20 % shade cover), Coffee-Banana (CB) (coffee dominantly intercropped with bananas) or Coffee-shade Tree (CT) (coffee dominantly intercropped with shade trees). Coffee-Banana had larger yield per ha (green bean kg ha (1086 +/- 736 kg ha(-1)) and yield per stem (green bean kg stem(-1)) (0.24 +/- 0.16 kg stem(-1)) than CO (670 +/- 457 kg ha(-1) and 0.21 +/- 0.26 kg stem(-1)) and CT (428 +/- 259 kg ha(-1) and 0.10 +/- 0.12 kg stem(-1)). Fruit loads, productive nodes, productive branches and cherry weight declined with shade cover, especially for shade cover > 30 %. Additionally, the same yield components correlated negatively with number of stems per tree. Fertilizer and fungicide use were related to more productive branches and cherry weight respectively, and stem borer was identified as the most important pest in this area. Our results suggest that yield in the region could be increased, i) by maintaining shade at an intermediate level, particularly at low and mid altitude and by reducing the number of stems per coffee tree (< 4), and ii) by improving soil fertility and protection against pest and disease.

TI  - Geographical and seasonal association between linamarin and cyanide exposure from cassava and the upper motor neurone disease konzo in former Zaire
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE & INTERNATIONAL HEALTH
AB  - High cyanide intake from consumption of insufficiently processed cassava has been advanced as a possible aetiology of the upper motor neurone disease konzo. However, similar neurodamage has not been associated with cyanide exposure from any other source. With an ecological study design, we compared 22 cases of konzo, 57 unaffected household members and 116 members from unaffected households, a total of 195 subjects, in konzo-affected savanna villages with 103 subjects in adjacent non-affected forest villages in the Paykongila area in the Bandundu Region, Zaire.
   In the dry season, the mean value (+/- SEM) of urinary thiocyanate, the main cyanide metabolite, was higher in the three groups in konzo-affected villages (563 +/- 105, 587 +/- 44 and 629 +/- 47 mu mol/l) than in unaffected villages (241 +/- 17 mu mol/l). In affected villages in the dry season when konzo incidence was high, mean urinary thiocyanate was also higher than the levels found in the wet season when incidence was low. The wet season values (mean +/- SEM) were 344 +/- 60, 381 +/- 35 and 351 +/- 27 mu mol/l. Urinary levels of inorganic sulphate were low in all groups, indicating low intake of the sulphur amino-acids which provide a substrate for cyanide detoxification. These findings support an aetiological role for cyanide in konzo. However, urinary linamarin, the cyanogenic glucoside acid source of cyanide in cassava, was more closely associated with the occurrence of konzo. The mean value (+/- SEM) of urinary linamarin in the konzo cases was 632 +/- 105 mu mol/l and in their household members 657 +/- 52 mu mol/l, which was significantly higher than in members of control households in the same village (351 +/- 28 mu mol/l) and in unaffected villages (147 +/- 18 mu mol/l). This suggests that a specific neurotoxic effect of linamarin, rather than the associated general cyanide exposure resulting from glucoside breakdown in the gut, may be the cause of konzo.

This species was once typically associated with sylvatic environments; however, cases of synanthropy and urbanization of this species have been increasingly reported in southeast Brazil. Despite the medical relevance of Oc. scapularis, its populational variability is not yet known. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing the morphological and genetic variabilities of this species.
   Methods: Population samples were characterized using the cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) mitochondrial gene and wing geometrics. Adult mosquitoes were collected from five sampling sites from remnants of the Atlantic forest embedded in the urban or rural areas of southeast Brazil.
   Results: In the 130 individuals analyzed, 46 COI haplotypes were detected. Haplotype diversity was high and ranged from 0.66 to 0.97. Six haplotypes were present in 61% of the individuals, whereas the remaining haplotypes were less frequent (39%). Wing shape was also highly polymorphic. Differentiation of populations across sampling sites according to genetic distances (F-st = -0.009 to 0.060) and morphological distances (Q(st) = 0.47) indicated that populations were not identical. No correlations were noted for phenetic and genetic diversities (p = 0.19) or for genetic or phenetic distances with geographical distances (p = 0.2 and p = 0.18, respectively).
   Conclusions: Our study results suggest that Oc. scapularis has a rich genetic patrimony, even though its habitat is fragmented. Implications of such genetic richness with respect to vectorial competence, plasticity, and ability to exploit urbanized areas need to be further investigated.

TI  - ASPECTS OF THE ECOLOGY OF PHLEBOTOMINES (Diptera: Psychodidae: Phlebotominae) IN AN AREA OF CUTANEOUS LEISHMANIASIS OCCURRENCE, MUNICIPALITY OF ANGRA DOS REIS, COAST OF RIO DE JANEIRO STATE, BRAZIL
T2  - REVISTA DO INSTITUTO DE MEDICINA TROPICAL DE SAO PAULO
AB  - Over a complete two-year period, phlebotomine specimens were caught in an area of cutaneous leishmaniasis occurrence in the municipality of Angra dos Reis. A manual suction tube was used to catch phlebotomines on house walls, and also light traps in domestic and peridomestic settings and in the forest. This yielded 14,170 specimens of 13 species: two in the genus Brumptomyia and eleven in the genus Lutzomyia. L. intermedia predominantly in domestic and peridomestic settings, with little presence in the forest, with the same trend being found in relation to L. migonei, thus proving that these species have adapted to the human environment. L. fischeri appeared to be eclectic regarding location, but was seen to be proportionally more endophilic. L. intermedia and L. migonei were more numerous in peridomestic settings, throughout the year, while L. fischeri was more numerous in domestic settings except in March, April, May and September. From the prevalence of L. intermedia, its proven anthropophily and findings of this species naturally infected with Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis, it can be incriminated as the main vector for this agent of cutaneous leishmaniasis in the study area, especially in the peridomestic environment. L. fischeri may be a coadjuvant in carrying the parasite.

TI  - The first canine visceral leishmaniasis outbreak in Campinas, State of Sao Paulo Southeastern Brazil
T2  - REVISTA DA SOCIEDADE BRASILEIRA DE MEDICINA TROPICAL
AB  - Introduction: Early detection of American visceral leishmaniasis (AVL) outbreak in animals is crucial for controlling this disease in non-endemic areas. Methods: Epidemiological surveillance (2009-2012) was performed in Campinas, State of So Paulo, Brazil. Results: In 2009, Leishmania chagasi was positively identified in four dogs. Entomological research and three serological studies (2010-2012) were undertaken as monitoring measures; these approaches revealed a moderate prevalence of Leishmania present in 4% of the canine population. Nyssomyia whitmani and Lutzomyia longipalpis were the predominant species identified. Conclusions: Detection of an AVL outbreak in dogs in an area with an evolving natural landscape containing sand flies is crucial for control programs.

TI  - Combining natural language processing and metabarcoding to reveal pathogen-environment associations
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Cryptococcus neoformans is responsible for life-threatening infections that primarily affect immunocompromised individuals and has an estimated worldwide burden of 220,000 new cases each year-with 180,000 resulting deaths-mostly in sub-Saharan Africa. Surprisingly, little is known about the ecological niches occupied by C. neoformans in nature. To expand our understanding of the distribution and ecological associations of this pathogen we implement a Natural Language Processing approach to better describe the niche of C. neoformans. We use a Latent Dirichlet Allocation model to de novo topic model sets of metagenetic research articles written about varied subjects which either explicitly mention, inadvertently find, or fail to find C. neoformans. These articles are all linked to NCBI Sequence Read Archive datasets of 18S ribosomal RNA and/or Internal Transcribed Spacer gene-regions. The number of topics was determined based on the model coherence score, and articles were assigned to the created topics via a Machine Learning approach with a Random Forest algorithm. Our analysis provides support for a previously suggested linkage between C. neoformans and soils associated with decomposing wood. Our approach, using a search of single-locus metagenetic data, gathering papers connected to the datasets, de novo determination of topics, the number of topics, and assignment of articles to the topics, illustrates how such an analysis pipeline can harness large-scale datasets that are published/available but not necessarily fully analyzed, or whose metadata is not harmonized with other studies. Our approach can be applied to a variety of systems to assert potential evidence of environmental associations.
   Author summary
   We expand the utility of Natural Language Processing (NLP), backtracking through metabarcodes, utilizing papers that may not mention our subject of interest, C. neoformans, in a departure from usual text analysis methods. We confirm that C. neoformans is associated with decomposing wood which is reinforced by the inferred literature studied here on C. neoformans and its close congeneric relatives. This work demonstrates the potential utility of pairing NLP with single-locus metagenetic data for the study of Neglected Tropical Diseases. While the results of this article are largely confirmatory, we present a novel method to study the ecological niches of rare pathogens that leverages the immense amount of data available to researchers in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) combined with a text-mining analysis based on Natural Language Processing. We demonstrate that text processing, noun identification, and verb identification can play an important role in analyzing a large corpus of documents together with metagenetic data. Forging this connection requires access to all of the available ecological 18S ribosomal RNA and Internal Transcribed Spacer NCBI SRA datasets. These datasets use metabarcoding to query taxonomic diversity in eukaryotic organisms, and in the case of the Internal Transcribed Spacer, they specifically target Fungi. The presence of specific species is inferred when diagnostic 18S or ITS gene region sequences are found in the SRA data. We searched for C. neoformans in all 18S and ITS datasets available and gathered all associated journal articles that either cite the SRA data accessions or are cited in the SRA data accessions. Published metagenetic data often have associated metadata including: latitude and longitude, temperature, and other physical characteristics describing the conditions in which the metagenetic sample was collected. These metadata are not always presented in consistent formats, so harmonizing study methods may be needed to appropriately compare metagenetic data as commonly required in metanalysis studies. We present an analysis which takes as input articles associated with SRA datasets that were found to contain evidence of C. neoformans. We apply NLP methods to this corpus of articles to describe the niche of C. neoformans. Our results reinforce the current understanding of C. neoformans's niche, indicating the pertinence of employing an NLP analysis to identify the niche of an organism. This approach could further the description of virtually any other organism that routinely appears in metagenetic surveys, especially pathogens, whose ecological niches are unknown or poorly understood.

TI  - Assessing Community Health: An Innovative Tool for Measuring Height and Length
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL PEDIATRICS
AB  - Anthropometric measurements, including height and length, are routinely needed for health research worldwide. Measurement boards are the current gold standard for obtaining the height and length of children. In community-based research, however, the size and weight of the measurement boards make them difficult and cumbersome to carry in the field. In addition, children and infants may express an unwillingness to be placed onto the measurement board. Electronic measuring tools commonly used in industry and contracting work are precise and portable. This study piloted a protocol to use an adapted laser measurement tool, the anthropometric measurement assist (AMA), to obtain height and recumbent length in children in Western Kenya. Intra-and inter-observer variability were determined and compared with measurement board measurements. Results of this initial pilot indicated that the AMA may be a viable alternative to measurement boards. The AMA can measure height/length accurately and reliably, is portable and is equivalent in price to measuring boards, making it a viable option for fieldwork in low-resourced countries.

TI  - Assessing the distribution, roosting site characteristics, and population of <i>Pteropus lylei</i> in Thailand
T2  - RAFFLES BULLETIN OF ZOOLOGY
AB  - Lyle's flying fox (Pteropus lylei) is classified as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources; therefore, assessing the population distribution and density of P. lylei is fundamental to its conservation and management. We combined community-based and field surveys to update information on the distribution and population of P. lylei in Thailand. Questionnaires were distributed to 2,024 government officers across 26 provinces (covering 20.29% of the area of Thailand), in a region previously identified as a P. lylei distribution hotspot. A total of 623 (30.78%) replies were obtained from the surveyed provinces. The field survey validated the results of the questionnaire, with 67.65% of respondents correctly identifying P. lylei in their area; there were 30 roosting sites, a total population of 75,016 bats, and a total roosting area of 1,328,720 m(2). The roosting sites of P. lylei were at an average elevation of 23.73 m, and near rivers and bodies of water, 53% of roost sites were located within Buddhist temples. In addition, bat hunting areas were reported around 57% of the roost sites, and 62% of the total bat population was located near these sites. Our results confirm that close proximity between P. lylei and human populations is common. It is imperative that we continue to improve our understanding of P. lylei habitat requirements to develop land-management strategies and conservation policies that simultaneously protect P. lylei and safeguard public health.

TI  - Centering Patient Expectations of a Novel Home-Based Oral Drug Treatment among <i>T. b. rhodesiense</i> Human African Trypanosomiasis Patients in Uganda
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE
AB  - The recent approval of fexinidazole for human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) caused by T. b. gambiense enables improved patient management that is pivotal to elimination. Effective in both the early and late stages of the disease, it obviates the need for invasive lumbar punctures which guide therapy, in some patients. Unlike existing injectable treatments requiring systematic hospitalisation, fexinidazole's oral administration will allow many patients to be treated in an outpatient or home-based setting. Drawing on interviews with 25 T. b. rhodesiense HAT patients managed under existing protocols in Uganda where trials of fexinidazole will begin shortly, this article explores patient expectations of the new protocol to help HAT programmes anticipate patient concerns. Alongside frightening symptoms of this life-threatening illness, the pain and anxiety associated with lumbar punctures and intravenous injections of melarsoprol contributed to a perception of HAT as a serious illness requiring expert medical care. While preferring a new protocol that would avoid these uncomfortable procedures, patients' trust in the care they received meant that nearly half were hesitant towards shifting care out of the hospital setting. Clinical observation is an important aspect of existing HAT care for patients. Programmes may need to offer extensive counselling and monitoring support before patients are comfortable accepting care outside of hospitals.

TI  - Application of stable isotope and mineral element fingerprint in identification of Hainan camellia oil producing area based on convolutional neural networks
T2  - FOOD CONTROL
AB  - Camellia oil is a unique high-end woody edible vegetable oil in China. In particular, camellia oil from Hainan is recognized as having unique quality and high value. Protecting the authenticity of its origin is essential to ensure the reputation and quality safety of the Hainan camellia oil market. Thus, we explored the potential of stable isotopes and mineral elements to origin traceability of camellia oil from Hainan, and analyzed the three stable isotopes and 21 mineral elements of camellia oil using stable isotope mass spectrometer and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer. The results showed that there were significant regional differences in stable isotope ratios and mineral element contents of camellia oil from different areas. The constructed convolutional neural network (CNN) model showed higher classification accuracy than other common classification models including orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA), support vector machine (SVM) and random forest. It not only distinguished the camellia oil from Hainan and other main producing areas with an accuracy of 93.33%, but also correctly identified the camellia oil from various regions in Hainan with an accuracy of 98.57%. Our research showed that stable isotope and mineral element characteristics were efficient indicators for identifying the geographic origin of camellia oil, and helped to fill the gap in the identification of camellia oil origin in China.

TI  - The Imaramagambo Onchocerciasis Focus in Southwestern Uganda: Interruption of Transmission after Disappearance of the Vector <i>Simulium neavei</i> and Its Associated Freshwater Crabs
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - It was not until early 1990s that, when the Imaramagambo focus of southwest Uganda was mapped, mass treatment with a single annual dose of ivermectin for onchocerciaisis control commenced. However, comprehensive investigations on its transmission were launched after a nationwide policy for onchocerciasis elimination in 2007. Entomological surveys throughout the focus from 2007 to 2015 have yielded few or no freshwater crabs (Potamonautes aloysiisabaudiae), which serve as the obligate phoretic host of the larvae and pupae of the vector Simulium neavei. No S. neavei flies have been observed or collected since 2007. Skin snips (microscopy) from 294 individuals in 2008 were negative for skin microfilariae, and of the 462 persons analyzed by polymerase chain reaction skin snip poolscreen in 2009, only five (1.08%) persons were indicated as infected with onchocerciasis. All five of the positive persons were at least 40 years old. Serosurvey results showed negative exposure among 3,332 children in 2012 and 3,108 children in 2015. Both were within the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval of the prevalence estimate of 0.06%, which confirmed the elimination of onchocerciasis. Treatment coverage in Imaramagambo was generally poor, and transmission interruption of onchocerciasis could not be attributed solely to annual mass treatment with ivermectin. There was sufficient evidence to believe that the possible disappearance of the S. neavei flies, presumed to have been the main vector, may have hastened the demise of onchocerciasis in this focus.

TI  - AMERICAN CUTANEOUS LEISHMANIASIS IN THE PONTAL OF PARANAPANEMA - SP, BRAZIL: ECOLOGICAL AND ENTOMOLOGICAL ASPECTS
T2  - REVISTA DO INSTITUTO DE MEDICINA TROPICAL DE SAO PAULO
AB  - American cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL) occurs in epidemic outbreaks and in sporadic cases with small annual variation in the Pontal of Paranapanema, SP. There is little research on the sandfly fauna of this region. The last outbreaks were related to the Movement of the Landless Workers (MST) and with the ecological tourism in preserved forest of the Parque Estadual do Morro do Diabo (PEMD). Aim: identification of the sandfly fauna within the PEMD, mainly anthropophilic species already incriminated as vectors of ACL, as well as their seasonality, hourly frequency and data of the behavior. M&M: The captures were undertaken with CDC light and Shannon traps from 6: 00 pm to 10: 00 pm, monthly from May 2000 to December 2001. The temperature and relative humidity data were registered at hourly intervals. Results: The captured species were: Brumptomyia brumpti, Nyssomyia neivai, Nyssomyia whitmani, Pintomyia fischeri and Pintomyia pessoai. The P. pessoai predominated (34.39%) and N. neivai was less found (0.74%), only being captured in CDC traps. Shannon trap captured more sandflies (63.01%) than the CDC traps (36.99%). Despite the environmental degradation anthropophilic species, indicates favorable bioecological conditions for persistence of vectors and potential transmission of leishmaniasis.

TI  - Cryptosporidiosis outbreak in Amazonia, French Guiana, 2018
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - BackgroundCryptosporidiosis outbreaks in South America are poorly documented. In March 2018, 51 cases of cryptosporidiosis were reported in Maripasoula, a village located in a remote forest area along the border between Surinam and French Guiana. MethodTo identify the origin of the epidemic, we performed epidemiological, microbiological, and environmental investigations. Only the cases involving diarrhoea and Cryptosporidium-positive stool were considered as bona fide, while cases involving diarrhoea and close contact with a confirmed case were classified as "possible". ResultsWe identified 16 confirmed cases and 35 possible ones. Confirmed cases comprised nine children (median age of 18 months, range: 6-21), one immunocompromised adult and six soldiers. One child required a hospitalisation for rehydration. All 16 Cryptosporidium stools were PCR positive, and sequencing of the gp60 gene confirmed only one Cryptosporidium hominis subtype IbA10G2. Tap water consumption was the only common risk factor identified. Contamination of the water network with Cryptosporidium parvum subtype IIdA19G2 was found. ConclusionWater quality is a major public health issue in Amazonian French Guiana, especially for population at risk (children, people with comorbidity, travelers). For them, alternative water supply or treatment should be implemented.

TI  - <i>Alchornea floribunda</i> (Mull. Arg.) - A review of its phytochemistry and biological activities
T2  - TROPICAL JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH
AB  - Alchornea floribunda is an evergreen plant that grows up to 32 feet tall and belongs to the family of Euphorbiaceae. It is found mainly in African forest undergrowth. In Nigeria, its leaves, stems and roots are widely used in folkloric medicine to manage ailments and diseases. The pharmacological activity of A. floribunda depends mainly on the part used. A previous study showed that the leaves have anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antioxidant and anti-cancer activities, while its roots and stem possess antibacterial activity. Thus, this review takes a critical look at previously reported findings and information about the phytochemistry, biological activities and various isolated bioactive constituents from the leaf, root and stem of Alchornea floribunda.

TI  - Tackling pollination of tubular flowers in Rutaceae and a case study of <i>Conchocarpus rubrus</i> (Galipeinae, Rutaceae)
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
AB  - Tubular flowers are only found in two distantly related groups in Rutaceae: the mainly Australian tribe Boronieae and the Neotropical subtribe Galipeinae. It is assumed that these nectar-rewarded, tubular flowers arose from convergent evolution driven by pollinator pressures. However, there are few empirical studies on pollen vectors of Neotropical Rutaceae. We explored the floral biology and pollination of Conchocarpus rubrus (A. St.-Hil.) Bruniera and Groppo (Galipeinae), including details about its nectar-secreting floral structures. We also compared the available records on floral biology and pollination of Boronieae and Galipeinae, aiming to provide a better understanding of the factors that influenced their floral evolution. Conchocarpus rubrus was pollinated by a single species of hermit hummingbird (Phaethornis idaliae Bourcier and Mulsant 1856) and by butterflies (Pyrginae and Pierinae), which take nectar accumulated at the bottom of the tube. Floral features and pollination data indicate that the convergent evolution of floral tubes in Rutaceae resulted from phenotypic specialization toward a subset of nectar-foraging pollinators with long mouth parts. Specifically, while in the Australian Boronieae the evolutive pathway toward sympetaly was likely influenced by Meliphagidae birds, in the Galipeinae, it was influenced by hummingbirds, butterflies, and settling moths. Besides a floral tube, floral features also linked to phenotypic specialization toward Meliphagidae pollination in Boronieae were related not only to birds' attraction (nectar features, attractive colors, etc.), but also to insect impediments (sensory exclusion, absence of landing platforms, etc.), occurring together with other ornithophilous features. In Galipeinae, floral features are more diverse, and functionally linked to the different groups of pollinators herein found.

TI  - Urban distribution of Phlebotominae in a cutaneous leishmaniasis focus, Argentina
T2  - MEMORIAS DO INSTITUTO OSWALDO CRUZ
AB  - Urbanization and vector domestication are currently proposed as factors that contributed to the recent increase of American cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL). Is likely also urban transmission? Oran is the main city in the Argentinean hyper-endemic area of ACL, and human cases in urban residences are usually reported. In order to assess the spatial distribution of risk, phlebotomine traps were located in different environments of Oran. A total of 7,787 sand flies were captured: Lutzomyia neivai (98.1%), Lutzomyia migonei (1.2%), Lutzomyia cortelezzii (0.7%), and one Lutzomyia shannoni. During the season of transmission (April-May) a single sand fly was obtained in one out of five urban sites, while a trap in a peri-urban pigsty captured up to 2,985 Lu. neivai/night. Captures performed in the other season of vector activity (September-October) revealed that small-scale changes in the pigsty environment resulted in noticeable changes in the abundance of Lu. neivai. In addition, in a new neighbourhood, on the fringe of the city, 1,073 Lu. neivai/site were captured in the forested edge but one in the yard of the houses. Therefore, in this urban ACL focus the human-vector effective contact risk is still associated with peri-urban vegetation and ecotone modifications despite the urban residence of the cases.

The disease becomes progressively worse over each rotation and control measures have met with limited success. We studied the population genetics of G. philippii to evaluate the role of sexual and asexual reproduction in its mode of spread. Populations were genetically distinct with high levels of inbreeding, and clonal spread to adjacent trees increased after the first rotation. Despite the high levels of genetic diversity seen at all sampling scales, migration rates appear low. Measures to reduce the underground spread of the pathogen as well as methods to prevent the initiation of new infections from basidiospores will be needed to reduce the incidence of root rot in A. mangium plantations.

TI  - "We've all got the virus inside us now": Disaggregating public health relations and responsibilities for health protection in pandemic London
T2  - SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately impacted ethnic minorities in the global north, evidenced by higher rates of transmission, morbidity, and mortality relative to population sizes. Orthodox Jewish neighbourhoods in London had extremely high SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence rates, reflecting patterns in Israel and the US. The aim of this paper is to examine how responsibilities over health protection are conveyed, and to what extent responsibility is sought by, and shared between, state services, and `community' stakeholders or representative groups, and families in public health emergencies. The study investigates how public health and statutory services stakeholders, Orthodox Jewish communal custodians and households sought to enact health protection in London during the first year of the pandemic (March 2020-March 2021). Twenty-eight semi-structured interviews were conducted across these cohorts. Findings demonstrate that institutional relations - both their formation and at times fragmentation - were directly shaped by issues surrounding COVID-19 control measures. Exchanges around protective interventions (whether control measures, contact tracing technologies, or vaccines) reveal diverse and diverging attributions of responsibility and authority. The paper develops a framework of public health relations to understand negotiations between statutory services and minority groups over responsiveness and accountability in health protection. Disaggregating public health relations can help social scientists to critique who and what characterises institutional relationships with minority groups, and what ideas of responsibility and responsiveness are projected by differently-positioned stakeholders in health protection.

TI  - Yield and quality of grapes cultivated under plastic coverings with different downy mildew control strategies
T2  - JOURNAL OF PHYTOPATHOLOGY
AB  - Viticulture has been expanding in tropical regions. However, the climate in these areas is generally favourable to the incidence of plant diseases, especially downy mildew. Plastic covers and warning systems have shown very positive results in disease control, but they are tools that have never been used simultaneously in a tropical area. The Vitis vinifera cv. BRS Morena table grape was evaluated as regards yield and quality under different downy mildew control strategies as carried out on vineyards trained on an overhead trellis system, covered by a black shading screen (BSS) or a braided polypropylene film (BPF), over a 3-year period. Different grapevine downy mildew management approaches defined the treatments: Co) Control (no spraying); Ca) Conventional control (calendar); Ba) "Rule 3-10" (Atti Istituto Botanico, 8, 1947, 45); Ma25) Low-infection efficiency-i(0)>25%; and Ma75) High-infection efficiency-i(0)>75% (Plant Disease, 84, 2000, 549). The occurrence of downy mildew and the amount of damage inflicted on vine yield and grape quality are directly related to the period of the crop cycle when there is rainfall. The use of the Ma75 warning system (Plant Disease, 84, 2000, 549) under braided polypropylene film resulted, for the most part, in similar vineyard productivity compared to Ca, but did not influence the number of branches and its fertility. The other warning systems decreased productivity by 31.9% compared to Ca. It was not possible to establish a relationship between the occurrence of downy mildew and its influence on grape sweetness and acidity. The use of warning systems led to a substantial reduction in fungicide sprays, approximately 66.7 to 71.3%, compared to the calendar system commonly used by the vine growers, with the Ba (Atti Istituto Botanico, 8, 1947, 45) and Ma75 controls (Plant Disease, 84, 2000, 549) leading to the highest fungicide saving.

TI  - Feijoa [<i>Acca sellowiana</i> (O. Berg) Burret] pollination: A review
T2  - SCIENTIA HORTICULTURAE
AB  - Pollination is a key reproductive event conducive to fruit set in Feijoa (Acca seliowiana). Flowers are uniflorous, often forming clusters and hermaphrodite, bearing stamens and one elongated carpel. Stamens are numerous ranging from 60 to 120 per flower depending on cultivar. Flowers do not produce nectar. Pollen grains are small with average size of 10-28 mu m in diameter. Some cultivars bear barriers to self-fertilization e.g. self-incompatibility and dichogamy by protogyny. Feijoa can be self-pollinated and able to set fruit, or partially, self fertile. Wind is a possible pollination agent, but more research is required to confirm it as a vector. Cross-pollination occurs among different cultivars. Birds are also reported as important pollinators. Muscicapidae, Turdidae and Thraupidae bird families are important floral visitors. Birds feed on feijoa petals and transfer pollen grains from their body parts to stigma, promoting pollination. Insects, particularly bees are also reported to be pollinators. However, this again is controversial. The small body of bees is unable to establish contact with the stigmatic surface. Experimental pollen germination, viability and tube growth are dependent on cultivar and culture media conditions. Few studies have been conducted on pollen germination. This review seeks to expand the current information on feijoa pollination in tropical and subtropical environments. It is expected that this review will be useful to senior researchers, undergraduate students, growers and the general public.

TI  - Chikungunya virus fusion properties elucidated by single-particle and bulk approaches
T2  - JOURNAL OF GENERAL VIROLOGY
AB  - Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a rapidly spreading, enveloped alphavirus causing fever, rash and debilitating polyarthritis. No specific treatment or vaccines are available to treat or prevent infection. For the rational design of vaccines and antiviral drugs, it is imperative to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in CHIKV infection. A critical step in the life cycle of CHIKV is fusion of the viral membrane with a host cell membrane. Here, we elucidate this process using ensemble-averaging liposome virus fusion studies, in which the fusion behaviour of a large virus population is measured, and a newly developed microscopy-based single-particle assay, in which the fusion kinetics of an individual particle can be visualised. The combination of these approaches allowed us to obtain detailed insight into the kinetics, lipid dependency and pH dependency of hemifusion. We found that CHIKV fusion is strictly dependent on low pH, with a threshold of pH 6.2 and optimal fusion efficiency below pH 5.6. At this pH, CHIKV fuses rapidly with target membranes, with typically half of the fusion occurring within 2 s after acidification. Cholesterol and sphingomyelin in the target membrane were found to strongly enhance the fusion process. By analysing our single-particle data using kinetic models, we were able to deduce that the number of rate-limiting steps occurring before hemifusion equals about three. To explain these data, we propose a mechanistic model in which multiple El fusion trimers are involved in initiating the fusion process.

TI  - BIOASSAY-GUIDED ISOLATION OF OCHROLIFUANINE: A BISINDOLE ALKALOID OF <i>DYERA COSTULATA</i> ACTIVE ON <i>TRYPANOSOMA BRUCEI BRUCEI</i>
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL FOREST SCIENCE
AB  - Dyera costulata, locally known as jelutong, have shown promising in vitro inhibitory activity against Trypanosoma brucei brucei strain BS221. The methanolic leaf extract, evaluated using Alamar Blue Assay, showed strong antitrypanosomal activity (IC50 0.58 +/- 0.01 mu g mL(-1)) and high selectivity index (SI value 169.5) towards the protozoa. While, the hexane leaf extract was moderately active (IC50 4.4 +/- 0.05 mu g mL(-1); SI value of 22.7). Total alkaloids extracted from the active methanolic fraction showed strong activity and high selectivity (IC50 0.08 +/- 0.07 mu g mL(-1), SI value 890) towards T. b. brucei. Bioassay-guided fractionation of the total alkaloid extract yielded an active compound 1 (IC50 0.06 +/- 0.03 mu g mL(-1), SI value 76.3). Compound 1 was identified as ochrolifuanine from the bisindole alkaloid group, based on spectral analysis (MS, 1D and 2D NMR). The presence of alkaloids in D. costulata leaves may be indicative of the various bioactivities observed in this plant. Previously, ochrolifuanine has been reported for antimalarial and antimicrobial activity. This study reports, for the first time, on the antitrypanosomal activity of ochrolifuanine from D. costulata.

TI  - Phylogeography of <i>Aedes aegypti</i> (Yellow Fever Mosquito) in South Florida: mtDNA Evidence for Human-Aided Dispersal
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - The invasive dengue vector Aedes aegypti has persisted for > 200 years in South Florida in the United States. We tested the hypotheses that Florida's landscape creates dispersal barriers and corridors and that long-distance human-aided dispersal structures populations of Ae. aegypti. We evaluated the phylogeography of 362 individuals from Florida's, East and West Coasts with a 760-bp (418- and 342-bp fragments of ND5 and ND4, respectively) mitochondrial sequence. Populations from these two coasts were not significantly differentiated, suggesting that limited urbanization in central Florida is not a strong barrier to gene flow. Evidence for long-distance dispersal between Ft. Lauderdale and the West and Ft. Myers and the East indicates the importance of human-aided dispersal. West Coast populations showed no genetic differentiation, indicating that West Coast rivers and bays did not significantly impede gene flow. Phylogeographic analysis of haplotypes showed two distinct matrilines with no geographic patterns, suggesting multiple introductions or balancing selection.

TI  - Demography of the threatened coral <i>Acropora cervicornis</i>: implications for its management and conservation
T2  - CORAL REEFS
AB  - Populations of Acropora cervicornis have collapsed throughout the Caribbean. This situation has prompted the initiation of many restoration efforts; yet, there are insufficient demographic data and analyses to effectively guide these initiatives. In this study we assessed the spatiotemporal variability of A. cervicornis vital rates. We also developed a population matrix model to (1) evaluate the risk of population extinction, (2) estimate population growth rates (lambda) considering different rates of colony fragmentation and fragment survival, (3) determine the demographic transition(s) that contribute the most to spatiotemporal differences in lambda s, and (4) analyze the effectiveness of outplanting coral fragments of different sizes. The model was parameterized by following the fate of 300 colonies from 2011 to 2013 at two localities in Puerto Rico. Demographic transitions varied spatiotemporally, with a significant interaction between location and time period on colony fate. Spatiotemporal variations in lambda were also observed. During the first year, populations exhibited lambda s below equilibrium (0.918 and 0.948), followed by a dramatic decline at both sites (0.535 and 0.709) during the second year. The lower lambda s were caused by a decrease in the probability of stasis of large-sized colonies coupled with lack of sexual recruits and a meager contribution of asexual recruitment. Spatial variations in lambda s were largely due to differences in the probability of medium-sized colonies advancing to the largest size class. The viability analysis forecasts that the populations will reach quasi-extinction levels of 25 % of the initial population size in a parts per thousand currency sign16 yrs. Numerical simulations indicate that outplanting fragments a parts per thousand yen250 cm in total linear length (TLL) would result in a higher asymptotic population size than outplanting smaller fragments. We argue, however, that transplanting colonies a parts per thousand currency sign100 cm TLL will be a better management strategy because they can be produced faster and in higher numbers at coral nurseries.

T2  - REVISTA DA SOCIEDADE BRASILEIRA DE MEDICINA TROPICAL
AB  - Visceral leishmaniasis is currently considered an emergent and reemergent disease, in agricultural and urban zones, both in domestic and peridomestic areas. The objective of this work was to verify the spatial distribution of Lutzomyia longipalpis and Lutzomyia cruzi in Mato Grosso State. Data from 1996 to 2004 was collected by the Entomology Laboratory, whose captures were carried with a CDC light trap. Sixty-eight of the 139 cities in the state have been studied. Lutzomyia longipalpis and Lutzomyia cruzi occurred in 23 and 22 cities, respectively. The results demonstrate the extensive occurrence of Lutzomyia longipalpis in areas with different vegetation types: savanna, transition and Amazon forest. Lutzomyia cruzi occurred mainly in cities with areas of marshland and savanna. Verification of the distribution of the vector populations in the state and their preferential vegetation type, provides an indication of vulnerable and/or receptive areas for disease transmission.

TI  - Neotropical migratory and resident birds occurring in sympatry during winter have distinct haemosporidian parasite assemblages
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY
AB  - Aim We compared the parasite assemblages of over-wintering migratory birds and permanent residents on the wintering grounds. We determined whether parasite sharing between migratory and resident birds is influenced by host phylogenetic relatedness. We then inferred whether migratory birds transport haemosporidian parasite lineages between the breeding and wintering grounds. Location Sierra de Bahoruco National Park, Dominican Republic, Hispaniola. Taxa Migratory and resident birds (primarily Aves: Passeriformes) and their haemosporidian parasites (order Haemosporida, Plasmodium, Haemoproteus and Parahaemoproteus). Methods We used mist nets to capture birds in thorn scrub, broadleaf dry forests and pine forests during midwinter. We used molecular methods to recognize haemosporidian parasites in blood samples, and genotyped infections based on the nucleotide differences in a region of the parasite cytochrome b gene. Results and Main Conclusion We identified 505 infections by 32 haemosporidian parasite lineages in 1,780 blood samples from 37 resident species, and in 901 blood samples from 14 overwintering migratory species, over five years at the same sites. Infection prevalence varied among migratory species from zero to 13%, whereas infection prevalence among resident species ranged up to 77%. Host relatedness did not predict parasite assemblage similarity. We discuss four hypotheses for the rarity of haemosporidian infections in migratory birds during winter, and for the infrequency of parasite sharing between migratory and resident birds: (a) relative abundance and host preferences of dipteran vectors lower parasite transmission to migratory birds; (b) parasite lineages adapted to infect endemic Caribbean hosts are unable to infect migratory species; (c) the physiology of migratory birds after migration and during winter reduces parasite survival; and (d) infected individuals suffer more pronounced mortality rates during migration. We highlight the link between host-parasite coevolution and the physiological adaptations associated with avian seasonal migration.

TI  - <i>Lutzomyia longipalpis</i> Presence and Abundance Distribution at Different Micro-spatial Scales in an Urban Scenario
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - The principal objective of this study was to assess a modeling approach to Lu. longipalpis distribution in an urban scenario, discriminating micro-scale landscape variables at microhabitat and macrohabitat scales and the presence from the abundance of the vector. For this objective, we studied vectors and domestic reservoirs and evaluated different environmental variables simultaneously, so we constructed a set of 13 models to account for microhabitats, macro-habitats and mixed-habitats. We captured a total of 853 sandflies, of which 98.35% were Lu. longipalpis. We sampled a total of 197 dogs; 177 of which were associated with households where insects were sampled. Positive rK39 dogs represented 16.75% of the total, of which 47% were asymptomatic. Distance to the border of the city and high to medium density vegetation cover ended to be the explanatory variables, all positive, for the presence of sandflies in the city. All variables in the abundance model ended to be explanatory, trees around the trap, distance to the stream and its quadratic, being the last one the only one with negative coefficient indicating that the maximum abundance was associated with medium values of distance to the stream. The spatial distribution of dogs infected with L. infantum showed a heterogeneous pattern throughout the city; however, we could not confirm an association of the distribution with the variables assessed. In relation to Lu. longipalpis distribution, the strategy to discriminate the micro-spatial scales at which the environmental variables were recorded allowed us to associate presence with macrohabitat variables and abundance with microhabitat and macrohabitat variables. Based on the variables associated with Lu. longipalpis, the model will be validated in other cities and environmental surveillance, and control interventions will be proposed and evaluated in the microscale level and integrated with socio-cultural approaches and programmatic and village (mesoscale) strategies.

TI  - Risk factors and micro-geographical heterogeneity of <i>Schistosoma</i> <i>haematobium</i> in Ndumo area, uMkhanyakude district, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa
T2  - ACTA TROPICA
AB  - Schistosomiasis is a snail-transmitted parasitic disease endemic in most rural areas of sub-Saharan Africa. However, the currently used prediction models fail to capture the focal nature of its transmission due to the macro-geographical levels considered and paucity of data at local levels. This study determined the spatial distribution of Schistosoma haematobium and related risk factors in Ndumo area, uMkhanyakude District, KwaZulu-Natal province in South Africa. A sample of 435 schoolchildren between 10 to 15 years old from 10 primary schools was screened for S. haematobium using the filtration method. Getis-Ord Gi* and Bernoulli model were used to determine the hotspots of S. haematobium infection intensity based on their spatial distribution. Semiparametric-Geographically Weighted Regression (s-GWR) model was used to predict and analyse the spatial distribution of S. haematobium in relation to environmental and socio-economic factors. We confirmed that schistosomiasis transmission is focal in nature as indicated by significant S. haematobium cases and infection intensity clusters (p < 0.05) in the study area. The s-GWR model performance was low (R-2=0.45) and its residuals did not show autocorrelation (Moran's I=-0.001; z-score=0.003 and p-value=0.997) indicating that the model was correctly spelled. The s-GWR model also indicated that the coefficients for some of the socio-economic variables such as distances of households from operational piped water collection points, distance from open water sources, religion, toilet use, household head and places of bath and laundry significantly (t-values +/-1.96) varied across the landscape thereby determining the variation of S. haematobium infection intensity. This evidence may be used for control and management of the disease at micro scale. However, there is need for further research into more factors that may improve the performance of the s-GWR models in determining the local variation of S. haematobium infection intensity.

TI  - Mitochondrial pseudogenes in the nuclear genome of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes: implications for past and future population genetic studies
T2  - BMC GENETICS
AB  - Background: Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is widely used in population genetic and phylogenetic studies in animals. However, such studies can generate misleading results if the species concerned contain nuclear copies of mtDNA (Numts) as these may amplify in addition to, or even instead of, the authentic target mtDNA. The aim of this study was to determine if Numts are present in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, to characterise any Numts detected, and to assess the utility of using mtDNA for population genetics studies in this species.
   Results: BLAST searches revealed large numbers of Numts in the Ae. aegypti nuclear genome on 146 supercontigs. Although the majority are short (80% < 300 bp), some Numts are almost full length mtDNA copies. These long Numts are not due to misassembly of the nuclear genome sequence as the Numt-nuclear genome junctions could be recovered by amplification and sequencing. Numt evolution appears to be a complex process in Ae. aegypti with ongoing genomic integration, fragmentation and mutation and the secondary movement of Numts within the nuclear genome.
   The PCR amplification of the putative mtDNA nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase subunit 4 (ND4) gene from 166 Southeast Asian Ae. aegypti mosquitoes generated a network with two highly divergent lineages (clade 1 and clade 2). Approximately 15% of the ND4 sequences were a composite of those from each clade indicating Numt amplification in addition to, or instead of, mtDNA. Clade 1 was shown to be composed at least partially of Numts by the removal of clade 1-specific bases from composite sequences following enrichment of the mtDNA. It is possible that all the clade 1 sequences in the network were Numts since the clade 2 sequences correspond to the known mitochondrial genome sequence and since all the individuals that produced clade 1 sequences were also found to contain clade 2 mtDNA-like sequences using clade 2-specific primers. However, either or both sets of clade sequences could have Numts since the BLAST searches revealed two long Numts that match clade 2 and one long Numt that matches clade 1. The substantial numbers of mutations in cloned ND4 PCR products also suggest there are both recently-derived clade 1 and clade 2 Numt sequences.
   Conclusion: We conclude that Numts are prevalent in Ae. aegypti and that it is difficult to distinguish mtDNA sequences due to the presence of recently formed Numts. Given this, future population genetic or phylogenetic studies in Ae. aegypti should use nuclear, rather than mtDNA, markers.

TI  - LABORATORY AND FIELD EVALUATIONS OF A REPELLENT SOAP CONTAINING DIETHYL TOLUAMIDE (DEET) AND PERMETHRIN AGAINST PHLEBOTOMINE SAND FLIES (DIPTERA, PSYCHODIDAE) IN VALLE DEL CAUCA, COLOMBIA
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - The repellency and insecticidal efficacy of Nopikex(R), a soap formulation containing 20% diethyl toluamide and 0.5% permethrin, was evaluated against a laboratory colony of phlebotomine sand flies (Lutzomyia longipalpis). The repellency of Nopikex soap was also compared with that of a placebo soap against another species (Lu. youngi) in a forest near Tulua, Valle del Cauca, Colombia. In laboratory trials of the soap, no reduction in repellency was seen 4 hr after application, but within 8 hr, repellency decreased significantly to 67.0% of the initial value (P < 0.05) based on calculations of the coefficient of protection (CP). Under field conditions, the soap gave up to 100% protection immediately after application, but within 4 hours its CP value had decreased to a median value of only 44.3%. The placebo soap was also found to be somewhat repellent when compared with no treatment, giving a median CP value of 67.7 immediately after application. No significant mortality was seen in sand flies within 24 hr of exposure to the soap in the laboratory, even in those that had fed on protected volunteers.

TI  - EMERGENCE OF DENGUE FEVER IN AMERICA: PATTERNS, PROCESSES AND PROSPECTS
T2  - INTERCIENCIA
AB  - Dengue fever (DF) is the most important arboviral disease of humans, infecting an estimated 50 million persons annually. Originally a zoonosis transmitted by sylvan mosquitoes to Old World primates, dengue has emerged as a cosmotropical urban pathogen now maintained in most endemic areas by human-vector contacts, especially with the domestic and anthropophilic mosquito Aedes aegypti. Epidemics with mortality from dengue hemorrhagic fever have become increasingly common in the Neotropics since the 1981 lethal outbreak in Cuba. In this contribution the status of the disease in Latin America is revised, and the characteristics of vector biology contributing to its emergence and predominance in urban areas are explored. Although the causes for the re-emergence of dengue are many, the following factors are identified as important: 1) unplanned urbanization increasing breeding habitats of the vector, in close association with high concentrations of potential human hosts; 2) cultural aspects that result in urban landscapes dominated by large numbers of abandoned water-holding containers next to high concentrations of potential human hosts; 3) socioeconomic factors, including poor sanitation, lack of reliable water high densities of dwellings and residents in small spaces, and others; and 4) increases in human movements that promote the transport of viral serotypes and genotypes to new regions and that increase the number of susceptible humans in infected areas. Dengue control programs based solely on the application of pesticides will never be effective or sustainable. Community-based source reduction programs aimed at reducing or eliminating water-holding containers occupied by the vector are currently being promoted as the most effective solution for reducing the incidence of dengue

TI  - Protocol for the use of legacy data and magnetic signature on soil mapping of Sao Paulo Central West, Brazil
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - The demand for information on the soil resource to support the establishment of public policies for land use and management has grown exponentially in the last years. However, there are still difficulties to the proper use of already existing information for soil mapping. Here we aimed to establish a protocol for soil mapping using legacy data, magnetic signature and soil attributes evaluation. A total of 493 soil samples were collected at 0-0.20 m in the geological domain of Western Plateau of Sao Paulo State. This work has three parts: First, we performed a classification analysis using soil mapping units (SMU) extracted from conventional soil map and Support Vector Machines algorithm (SVM). As covariates, we used categorical information, such as geology, dissection and land-form maps. Second, we used soil attributes to perform a duster analysis using k-means as partitioning method. To choose the optimal number of clusters, the same number of SMU showed in the conventional soil map (e.g. 34 clusters) were used. The last step was to compare soil and clusters maps predicted by SVM with the conventional soil map. Results showed good performance of SVM for both classifications (dusters and SMU), with overall accuracy of 0.60 and 0.90 respectively. In addition, the distribution of soil attributes within each cluster was more homogeneous and well distributed than within SMU, showing that is very possible to use numerical classification for soil mapping. Future soil surveys could use duster analysis as a preliminary evaluation for better understanding of tropical soil variations. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Sylvatic transmission of arboviruses among Bornean orangutans
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Wild populations of nonhuman primates live in regions of sylvatic arbovirus transmission. To assess the status of arbovirus transmission in Bornean forests and the susceptibility of wild orangutans to arboviral infection, blood samples of wild orangutans. semi-captive orangutans, and humans were examined. Samples were tested by plaque reduction neutralization test for antibodies to viruses representing three families (Flaviviridae, Alphaviridae, and Bunyaviridae), including dengue-2, Japanese encephalitis, Zika, Langat, Tembusu, Sindbis, Chikungunya, and Batai viruses. Both wild and semi-captive orangutan groups as well as local human populations showed serologic evidence of arbovirus infection. The presence of neutralizing antibodies among wild orangutans strongly suggests the existence of sylvatic cycles for dengue, Japanese encephalitis, and sindbis viruses in North Borneo. The present study demonstrates that orangutans are susceptible to arboviral infections in the wild, although the impact of arboviral infections on this endangered ape remain unknown.

TI  - Surveillance of intestinal schistosomiasis during control: a comparison of four diagnostic tests across five Ugandan primary schools in the Lake Albert region
T2  - PARASITOLOGY
CP  - British-Society-for-Parasitology (BSP) Autumn Symposium on The Multidisciplinarity of Parasitology - Host-Parasite Evolution in an Ever Changing World
AB  - Programmatic surveillance of intestinal schistosomiasis during control can typically use four diagnostic tests, either singularly or in combination, but these have yet to be cross-compared directly. Our study assembled a complete diagnostic dataset, inclusive of infection intensities, from 258 children from five Ugandan primary schools. The schools were purposely selected as typical of the endemic landscape near Lake Albert and reflective of high- and low-transmission settings. Overall prevalence was: 44.1% (95% CI 38.0-50.2) by microscopy of duplicate Kato-Katz smears from two consecutive stools, 56.9% (95% CI 50.8-63.0) by urine-circulating cathodic antigen (CCA) dipstick, 67.4% (95% CI 61.6-73.1) by DNA-TaqMan (R) and 75.1% (95% CI 69.8-80.4) by soluble egg antigen enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (SEA-ELISA). A cross-comparison of diagnostic sensitivities, specificities, positive and negative predictive values was undertaken, inclusive of a latent class analysis (LCA) with a LCA-model estimate of prevalence by each school. The latter ranged from 9.6% to 100.0%, and prevalence by school for each diagnostic test followed a static ascending order or monotonic series of Kato-Katz, urine-CCA dipstick, DNA-TaqMan (R) and SEA-ELISA. We confirm that Kato-Katz remains a satisfactory diagnostic standalone in high-transmission settings but in low-transmission settings should be augmented or replaced by urine-CCA dipsticks. DNA-TaqMan (R) appears suitable in both endemic settings though is only implementable if resources permit. In low-transmission settings, SEA-ELISA remains the method of choice to evidence an absence infection. We discuss the pros and cons of each method concluding that future surveillance of intestinal schistosomiasis would benefit from a flexible, context-specific approach both in choice and application of each diagnostic method, rather than a single one-size fits all approach.

TI  - <i>Calonectria</i> species, including four novel taxa, associated with <i>Eucalyptus</i> in Malaysia
T2  - MYCOLOGICAL PROGRESS
AB  - The genus Calonectria accommodates many important pathogens of agricultural, horticultural and forestry crops, including Eucalyptus. During 2017 surveys of Eucalyptus diseases in Sabah, Malaysia, typical symptoms of Calonectria leaf blight were observed. A large number of Calonectria isolates were collected from diseased leaves and soils associated with symptomatic trees. The aim of this study was to identify and resolve the phylogenetic relationships between these isolates using morphological characters and DNA sequence comparisons for six gene regions. From a collection of 73 isolates, eight species residing in three species complexes were identified. Amongst these, four undescribed species were characterized and are named here as Ca. borneana, Ca. ladang, Ca. pseudomalesiana and Ca. tanah. Results of this study support the view that planted Eucalyptus in tropical and subtropical areas of the world represent niches remarkably rich in Calonectria spp. This also has implications for the management of diseases on these important trees.

TI  - Epidemiological, clinical and laboratory profile of scrub typhus cases detected by serology and RT-PCR in Kumaon, Uttarakhand: a hospital-based study
T2  - TROPICAL DOCTOR
AB  - We analysed the epidemiology, clinical and laboratory data of the 168 scrub typhus cases confirmed by a combination of any one of the following: real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and/or immunofluorescence assay (IFA) (IgM and/or IgG). The peak season for scrub typhus was from July to October. By multivariate binary logistic regression analysis, the risk of scrub typhus was about four times in those working in occupation related to forest work. Major clinical manifestations were fever (100%), myalgia (65%), cough (51%) and vomiting (46%); major complications were meningitis/meningoencephatilitis (12.5%) and multi-organ failure (MOF) and pneumonia (5.3% each). Laboratory investigations revealed raised aminotranferase levels and thrombocytopenia in most confirmed cases. We conclude that scrub typhus is an important cause of febrile illness in the Kumaon hills of Uttarakhand where this disease had not previously been considered to exist.

TI  - Machine learning-based risk factor analysis and prevalence prediction of intestinal parasitic infections using epidemiological survey data
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   Previous epidemiological studies have examined the prevalence and risk factors for a variety of parasitic illnesses, including protozoan and soil-transmitted helminth (STH, e.g., hookworms and roundworms) infections. Despite advancements in machine learning for data analysis, the majority of these studies use traditional logistic regression to identify significant risk factors.
   Methods
   In this study, we used data from a survey of 54 risk factors for intestinal parasitosis in 954 Ethiopian school children. We investigated whether machine learning approaches can supplement traditional logistic regression in identifying intestinal parasite infection risk factors. We used feature selection methods such as InfoGain (IG), ReliefF (ReF), Joint Mutual Information (JMI), and Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (MRMR). Additionally, we predicted children's parasitic infection status using classifiers such as Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests (RF) and XGBoost (XGB), and compared their accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) scores. For optimal model training, we performed tenfold cross-validation and tuned the classifier hyperparameters. We balanced our dataset using the Synthetic Minority Oversampling (SMOTE) method. Additionally, we used association rule learning to establish a link between risk factors and parasitic infections.
   Key findings
   Our study demonstrated that machine learning could be used in conjunction with logistic regression. Using machine learning, we developed models that accurately predicted four parasitic infections: any parasitic infection at 79.9% accuracy, helminth infection at 84.9%, any STH infection at 95.9%, and protozoan infection at 94.2%. The Random Forests (RF) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifiers achieved the highest accuracy when top 20 risk factors were considered using Joint Mutual Information (JMI) or all features were used. The best predictors of infection were socioeconomic, demographic, and hematological characteristics.
   Conclusions
   We demonstrated that feature selection and association rule learning are useful strategies for detecting risk factors for parasite infection. Additionally, we showed that advanced classifiers might be utilized to predict children's parasitic infection status. When combined with standard logistic regression models, machine learning techniques can identify novel risk factors and predict infection risk.

TI  - Environmental Determinants of <i>Aedes albopictus</i> Abundance at a Northern Limit of Its Range in the United States
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Aedes albopictus is a vector of arboviruses with high rates of morbidity and mortality. The northern limit of Ae. albopictus in the northeastern United States runs through New York state (NYS) and Connecticut. We present a landscape-level analysis of mosquito abundance measured by daily counts of Ae. albopictus from 338 trap sites in 12 counties during May-September 2017. During the study period, the mean number of Ae. albopictus caught per day of trapping across all sites was 3.21. We constructed four sets of negative binomial generalized linear models to evaluate how trapping methodology, land cover, as well as temperature and precipitation at multiple time intervals influenced Ae. albopictus abundance. Biogents-Sentinel (BGS) traps were 2.78 times as efficient as gravid traps and 1.49 times as efficient as CO2-baited CDC light traps. Greater proportions of low- and medium-intensity development and low proportions of deciduous cover around the trap site were positively associated with increased abundance, as were minimum winter temperature and March precipitation. The cumulative precipitation within a 28-day time window before the date of collection had a nonlinear relationship with abundance, such that greater cumulative precipitation was associated with increased abundance until approximately 70 mm, above which there was a decrease in abundance. We concluded that populations are established in Nassau, Suffolk, and New York City counties in NYS; north of these counties, the species is undergoing population invasion and establishment. We recommend that mosquito surveillance programs monitoring the northward invasion of Ae. albopictus place BGS traps at sites chosen with respect to land cover.

TI  - Humidity effects on avian blood parasites in the Caatinga of Brazil
T2  - ORNITHOLOGY RESEARCH
AB  - The Caatinga is an ecologically diverse region encompassing a variety of environments. Given the influence of the environment on parasite-host systems, the goals of this study were to investigate the presence of hemoparasites in birds from different Caatinga physiognomies, both for comparison among them and between the Caatinga and other documented biomes. For this, we collected blood samples from 59 birds in three Caatinga physiognomies from the state of Pernambuco, Brazil. In comparison with previous studies in other biomes, the frequency of hemoparasites in the different environments of the Caatinga (20%) is higher than that of the Cerrado (7%), and the same as obtained for the Atlantic Forest (20%). The Caatinga physiognomy that revealed the highest hemoparasitism index is known asBrejo de Altitude(high-altitude humid area).Brejos de Altitudeoccurs between ca. 500 and 1100 m a.s.l., where orographic rains result in levels of rainfall that can reach 1200 mm/year. The coincidence of frequencies of hemoparasites for Caatinga and Atlantic Forest may arise from the detected high frequency of parasitized individuals in theBrejo de Altitude. The blood samples from this region were responsible for 60% of the parasitized samples of our study. This could be attributable to higher humidity, facilitating higher reproductive success of the parasite vectors.

TI  - Biogeography of Culicidae (Diptera) in the Grand Canyon region, southwestern USA
T2  - PAN-PACIFIC ENTOMOLOGIST
AB  - We describe mosquito diversity, biogeography, and disease vector issues ill the Grand Canyon (GC) region on the southern Colorado Plateau in northern Arizona. We detected the presence of 18 species from field collections and museum specimens from 19742005, including 10 new county records and two new regional records. Arizona State county records include a potential total of 24 species, while 32 species have been mapped as occurring in this region. The combined potential fauna is depauperate, a pattern consistent with that of low-vagility taxa in this large, deep canyon ecoregion. Culiseta incidens was by far the most common and widely distributed species (relative distributional frequency, RDF = 0.44), followed by Ochlerotatus epactius (0.12), Culex tarsalis (0.09), Culiseta inornata (0.08), and Anopheles franciscanus (0.06): all other species were rare (RDF <= 0.05). The diversity of detected species was non-linearly related to elevation, with six species distributed widely across elevation, five species found below 1800 m, and seven species occurring above 1800 m. The potential and detected fauna is dominated (44.7-61.1 percent) by Mexican and neotropical taxa, with a lower diversity of indigenous and boreal-palearctic species. The proportion of Mexican taxa in file GC region remains equivalent to that in southern Arizona, but GC has more palearctic taxa and fewer neotropical taxa. Several species may vector avian, livestock, and human diseases, including West Nile virus (WNV), including Culex spp. (widespread) and Aedes vexans (low elevations), while Ochlerotatus epactius, Oc. cataphylla, Anopheles hermsi, and Cx. erythrothorax occasionally are locally pestiferous. While abundant, Cs. incidens is regarded as having a low vector competence for WNV.

TI  - <i>Leishmania</i> (<i>Viannia</i>) <i>braziliensis</i> infection in wild small mammals in ecotourism area of Brazil
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Leishmaniases are parasitic diseases transmitted to mammalian hosts by sand fly vectors (Diptera: Psychodidae). Despite the increasing occurrence of visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis cases in urban centers, their transmission still occur primarily in wild environments and may be associated with professional activities and recreation, such as ecotourism. The Reserva Particular do Patrimo A nio Natural Santua A rio do Carac E a (RPPNSC) is one of the largest ecotourism attractions in the State of Minas Gerais, Brazil, and comprises an area of environmental preservation with 11,233 hectares presenting a transitional vegetation between Cerrado and Atlantic Forest. The present study describes the abundance of small mammals in RPPNSC, the isolation and identification of Leishmania in five wild animals. Small mammals were bimonthly trapped along 6 trails within the RPPNSC with 10 Tomahawk traps each. Two trails were located in peridomiciliary areas near tourist lodging facilities, and four trails were located at sites visited by tourists in forest areas. The most prevalent species were Akodon cursor, Cerradomys subflavus and Oligoryzomys nigripes. Six isolates of Leishmania were obtained from these animals and identified as Leishmania braziliensis through HSP70-PCR RFLP method. Leishmania spp. DNA was detected by kDNA-PCR method and isolated by biphasic culture. Studies point to some of the captured species as potential wild reservoirs of Leishmania, suggesting they may be involved in the transmission cycle in these wild environments.

TI  - Identification and Validation of Candidate Genes Conferring Resistance to Downy Mildew in Maize (<i>Zea mays</i> L.)
T2  - GENES
AB  - Downy mildew (DM) is a major disease of maize that causes significant yield loss in subtropical and tropical regions around the world. A variety of DM strains have been reported, and the resistance to them is polygenically controlled. In this study, we analyzed the quantitative trait loci (QTLs) involved in resistance to Peronosclerospora sorghi (sorghum DM), P. maydis (Java DM), and Sclerophthora macrospora (crazy top DM) using a recombinant inbred line (RIL) from a cross between B73 (susceptible) and Ki11 (resistant), and the candidate genes for P. sorghi, P. maydis, and S. macrospora resistance were discovered. The linkage map was constructed with 234 simple sequence repeat (SSR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers, which was identified seven QTLs (chromosomes 2, 3, 6, and 9) for three DM strains. The major QTL, located on chromosome 2, consists of 12.95% of phenotypic variation explained (PVE) and a logarithm of odds (LOD) score of 14.12. Sixty-two candidate genes for P. sorghi, P. maydis, and S. macrospora resistance were obtained between the flanked markers in the QTL regions. The relative expression level of candidate genes was evaluated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) using resistant (CML228, Ki3, and Ki11) and susceptible (B73 and CML270) genotypes. For the 62 candidate genes, 15 genes were upregulated in resistant genotypes. Among these, three (GRMZM2G028643, GRMZM2G128315, and GRMZM2G330907) and AC210003.2_FG004 were annotated as leucine-rich repeat (LRR) and peroxidase (POX) genes, respectively. These candidate genes in the QTL regions provide valuable information for further studies related to P. sorghi, P. maydis, and S. macrospora resistance.

TI  - A surrogate life cycle of <i>Amblyomma ovale</i> Koch, 1844
T2  - TICKS AND TICK-BORNE DISEASES
AB  - As ticks spend most of their time off-host, the environment is a major selective force of these parasites. In fact, human impact on landscapes has favored a minority of tick species which became well-known pests. However, this is an ongoing process and novel pests may arise. We herein report a surrogate life cycle of a neotropical tick species. Amblyomma ovate, and which may be related to an increased risk of human rickettsiosis. Under natural conditions, adults of this tick species feed on carnivores and exhibit non-nidicolous ambush behavior, whereas larvae and nymphs feed on small rodents and birds. In an anthropized spot within an Atlantic rainforest reserve of Brazil, an A. ovate population exhibited a nidicolous behavior with all 3 tick stages feeding on the dog. This dog's infestation was outstandingly high, and it displayed the highest anti-Rickettsia titers and harbored Rickettsia-infected ticks. (c) 2012 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

TI  - Seroepidemiological survey of canine leishmaniasis in endemic areas of Cuiaba, State of Mato Grosso
T2  - REVISTA DA SOCIEDADE BRASILEIRA DE MEDICINA TROPICAL
AB  - Leishmaniases are zoonoses that are undergoing expansion in Brazil. Dogs are of importance regarding transmission and dispersion of the disease, especially in areas presenting visceral leishmaniasis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the seroprevalence of leishmaniasis among domestic dogs in the urban area of Cuiaba. For this investigation, four districts of Cuiaba were selected, one in each administrative region. The dog sampling was defined statistically, taking the prevalence to be 8.4%. Among the 468 dogs examined, 16 presented an indirect immunofluorescence reaction, thus resulting in an overall prevalence of 3.4%. There was no predisposition towards canine leishmaniasis occurrences in relation to breed, sex or age. The main risk factors for occurrences of canine infection identified in the city of Cuiaba were the presence of dogs living in areas surrounding homes and the proximity of homes to forests. Thus, there have been changes in leishmaniasis occurrences within the urban environment.

TI  - Endozoochory decreases environmental filtering imposed to seedlings
T2  - JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE
AB  - Questions Recruitment microsites are imposed on plants, first by seed dispersal and then by the environment. Different seed dispersal vectors could decrease or increase the environmental filtering imposed on seedlings, depending on their specificity to deliver seeds to suitable microsites for germination and establishment. We addressed the hypothesis that endozoochory reduces the environmental filtering imposed to seedlings to a larger extent than does anemochory. We predicted that seedlings from animal-dispersed species should show a higher degree of environmental coupling. Location Northern Patagonian Andean region of Argentina, 40-42 degrees S. Methods We characterized the relationship of seedlings, saplings and reproductive individuals to total radiation, air temperature and relative humidity for 16 woody species growing in 25 plant communities of different post-fire ages in temperate forests of southern South America. Results Seedlings and saplings of endozoochorous species occurred under more similar environmental conditions than seedlings and saplings of anemochorous species. Basically, the mean difference in plantenvironment correlation coefficients between saplings and seedlings was <0.2 for all endozoochorous species and >0.2 for all anemochorous species for all environmental variables. Comparisons between dispersal modes were also statistically significant before and after controlling for phylogenetic relationships among species. Even though saplings and seedlings of endozochorous species tended to occur under similar environmental conditions, we did not find evidence that saplings and seedlings co-occur in the same physical microsites. Finally, we did not find evidence either that seedlings of endozoochorous species tended to occur differentially underneath reproductive individuals of the same species (i.e. more seeds falling by gravity beneath maternal plants). Conclusions The tighter coupling between seedlings of endozoochorous species and environmental factors persisting to the sapling stage suggests that relying on animals for seed dispersal reduces mortality costs during the early stages of recruitment by reducing the environmental filtering imposed on seedlings.

TI  - Multidrug Therapy for Leprosy Can Cure Patients with Lobomycosis in Acre State, Brazil: A Proof of Therapy Study
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Lobomycosis, also referred to as lacaziosis, is an endemic cutaneous and subcutaneous fungal disease that mainly affects Amazonian forest dwellers in Brazil. There is no disease control program in place in Brazil, and antifungal therapy failures are common, and the therapy is inaccessible to most patients. We performed a randomized, unblinded clinical trial testing the cure rate of multiple drug therapy (MDT) for leprosy with surgical excision, with or without itraconazole. A control arm consisted of patients who did not adhere to either therapeutic regimens but continued to be followed up. Multiple drug therapy consisted of monthly supervised doses of 600 mg rifampicin, 300 mg clofazimine, and 100 mg dapsone, in addition to daily doses of 50 mg clofazimine and 100 mg dapsone. The patients in the MDT plus itraconazole arm also received itraconazole 100 mg twice daily. We followed up 54 patients from the MDT group and 26 patients from the MDT plus itraconazole group for an average of 4 years and 9 months. The 23 controls were followed up for 6 months on average. The following endpoints were observed: 1) unchanged (no apparent improvement), 2) improved (reduction in lesion size and/or pruritus), and 3) cured (complete remission of the lesions, no viable fungi, and no relapse for 2 years after the end of the drug treatment). The results indicated a significantly greater likelihood of cure associated with the use of multidrug therapy for leprosy with or without itraconazole when compared with the control group. The addition of itraconazole to MDT was not associated with improved outcomes, suggesting that MDT alone is effective.

TI  - Spatial Owner-Dog Seroprevalence of <i>Leptospira</i> spp. Antibodies in Oceanic Islands and Costal Mainland of Southern Brazil
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE
AB  - Leptospirosis has been described as a disease neglected worldwide. Affecting humans and animals, the disease is often related to poor environmental conditions such as lack of sanitation and presence of synanthropic rodents. Despite being considered as a One Health issue, no study has focused on comparing owner-dog seroprevalence between islands and seashore mainland. Accordingly, the present study assessed anti-Leptospira spp. antibodies by applying microscopic agglutination test (MAT) methods to Leptospira and assessing associated risk factors via univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis of owners and their dogs in islands and seashore mainland of southern Brazil. No anti-Leptospira spp. Seropositivity was found in 330 owner serum samples, while dogs presented an overall seroprevalence of 5.9%. All seropositive dogs reacted to serogroups of Leptospira interrogans, including 66.7% of Pyrogenes, 44.4% Canicola, 22.2% Icterohaemorrhagiae, 16.7% Australis; six reacted to more than one serogroup. No association was found among seropositivity and epidemiological variables, except that neighborhood dogs were less likely to be seropositive. Although no seropositivity was observed in owners, seropositivity in dogs had the potential to indicate such species as being sentinels for environmental exposure and potential human risk of infection.

TI  - Redistribution and export of contaminated sediment within eastern Fukushima Prefecture due to typhoon flooding
T2  - EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS
AB  - Tropical cyclones expose river basins to heavy rainfall and flooding, and cause substantial soil erosion and sediment transport. There is heightened interest in the effects of typhoon floods on river basins in northeast Japan, as the migration of radiocaesium-bearing soils contaminated by the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant (FDNPP) accident will affect future radiation levels. The five main catchments surrounding FDNPP are the Odaka, Ukedo, Maeda, Kuma and Tomioka basins, but little quantitative modelling has been undertaken to identify the sediment redistribution patterns and controlling processes across these basins. Here we address this issue and report catchment-scale modelling of the five basins using the GETFLOWS simulation code. The three-dimensional (3D) models of the basins incorporated details of the geology, soil type, land cover, and used data from meteorological records as inputs. The simulation results were checked against field monitoring data for water flow rates, suspended sediment concentrations and accumulated sediment erosion and deposition. The results show that the majority of annual sediment migration in the basins occurs over storm periods, thus making typhoons the main vectors for redistribution. The Ukedo and Tomioka basins are the most important basins in the region in terms of overall sediment transport, followed by the other three basins each with similar discharge amounts. Erosion is strongly correlated with the underlying geology and the surface topography in the study area. A low permeability Pliocene Dainenji formation in the coastal area causes high surface water flow rates and soil erosion. Conversely, erosion is lower in an area with high permeability granite basement rocks between the Hatagawa and Futaba faults in the centre of the study area. Land cover is also a factor controlling differences in erosion and transport rates between forested areas in the west of the study area and predominantly agricultural areas towards the east. The largest sediment depositions occur in the Ogaki and Takigawa Dams, at the confluence of the Takase and Ukedo Rivers, and at the Ukedo River mouth. Having clarified the sediment redistribution patterns and controlling processes, these results can assist the ongoing task of monitoring radioactive caesium redistribution within Fukushima Prefecture, and contribute to the design and implementation of measures to protect health and the environment.

TI  - Assessing Diversity, <i>Plasmodium</i> Infection and Blood Meal Sources in Mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) from a Brazilian Zoological Park with Avian Malaria Transmission
T2  - INSECTS
AB  - Simple Summary
   Zoological gardens in forest areas host a large diversity of vertebrate species (exotic and indigenous, free-living and captive, migrant and resident), resulting in an artificial proximity of animal species that would never share the same environment in natural conditions. The presence of mosquitoes enables the transmission of vector-borne pathogens, as is the case with avian malaria parasites. The mild infections in some bird species may become a serious threat to others that do not possess a natural resistance. Thus, the identification of the potential vectors of these parasites is important for future control of these agents, aiming at the bird species conservation. In this study, we collected over 2000 mosquitoes in Sao Paulo Zoo and analyzed them through molecular methods. Six different mosquito species yielded positive for the targeted parasite DNA. We demonstrated that these culicids had fed mainly on bird species and we reported three mosquito species that have never been previously incriminated as potential vectors of these parasites, enabling the use of more specific measures for vigilance and mosquito control.
   Avian malaria parasites are widespread parasites transmitted by Culicidae insects belonging to different genera. Even though several studies have been conducted recently, there is still a lack of information about potential vectors of Plasmodium parasites, especially in Neotropical regions. Former studies with free-living and captive animals in Sao Paulo Zoo showed the presence of several Plasmodium and Haemoproteus species. In 2015, a pilot study was conducted at the zoo to collect mosquitoes in order to find out (i) which species of Culicidae are present in the study area, (ii) what are their blood meal sources, and (iii) to which Plasmodium species might they be potential vectors. Mosquitoes were morphologically and molecularly identified. Blood meal source and haemosporidian DNA were identified using molecular protocols. A total of 25 Culicidae species were identified, and 6 of them were positive for Plasmodium/Haemoproteus DNA. Ten mosquito species had their source of blood meal identified, which were mainly birds, including some species that were positive for haemosporidian parasites in the former study mentioned. This study allowed us to expand the list of potential vectors of avian malaria parasites and to improve our knowledge of the evolutionary and ecological relationships between the highly diverse communities of birds, parasites, and vectors present at Sao Paulo Zoo.

TI  - Integrating machine learning and environmental variables to constrain uncertainty in crop yield change projections under climate change
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY
AB  - Robust crop yield projections under future climates are fundamental prerequisites for reliable policy formation. Both process-based crop models and statistical models are commonly used for this purpose. Process-based models tend to simplify processes, minimize the effects of extreme events, and ignore biotic pressures, while statistical models cannot deterministically capture intricate biological and physiological processes underpinning crop growth. We attempted to integrate and overcome shortcomings in both modelling frameworks by integrating the dynamic linear model (DLM) and random forest machine learning model (RF) with nine global gridded crop models (GGCM), respectively, in order to improve projections and reduce uncertainties of maize (Zea mays L.) and soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merrill) yield projections. Our results demonstrated substantial improvements in model performance accuracy by using RF in concert with GGCM across China's maize and soybean belt. This improvement surpasses that achieved using DLM. For maize, the GGCM+RF models increased the r values from 0.15 to 0.61-0.64-0.77 and decreased nRMSE from approximately 0.20 to 0.50-0.13-0.17 compared with using GGCM alone. For soybean, the models increased r from 0.37 to 0.70-0.54-0.70 and decreased nRMSE from 0.17 to 0.35-0.17-0.20 compared with using GGCM alone. The main factors influencing maize yield changes included chilling days (CD), crop pests and diseases (CPDs), and drought, while for soybean the primary influencing factors included CPD, tropical days (based on exceeding a maximum temperature), and drought. Our approach decreased uncertainties by 33-78% for maize and by 56-68% for soybean. The main source of uncertainty for GGCM was the crop model. For GGCM+RF, the main source of uncertainty for the 2040-2069 period was the global climate model, while the main source of uncertainty for the 2070-2099 period was the climate scenario. Our results provide a novel, robust, and pragmatic framework to constrain uncertainties in order to accurately assess the impact of future climate change on crop yields. These results could be used to interpret future ensemble studies by accounting for uncertainty in crop and climate models, as well as to assess future emissions scenarios.

TI  - FTA Cards Facilitate Storage, Shipment, and Detection of Arboviruses in Infected <i>Aedes aegypti</i> Collected in Adult Mosquito Traps
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - The utility of applying infected Aedes aegypti to Flinders Technology Associates (FTA (R)) cards for storage, transport, and detection of dengue, Zika, and Barmah Forest viruses was assessed in laboratory-based experiments. The mosquitoes had been removed from Gravid Aedes Traps maintained under conditions of high temperature and humidity. RNA of all viruses could be detected in infected mosquitoes on FTA cards either individually or in pools with uninfected mosquitoes, and stored for up to 28 days. Importantly, there was only a minimal decrease in RNA levels in mosquitoes between days 0 and 28, indicating that viral RNA was relatively stable on the cards. FTA cards thus provide a mechanism for storing potentially infected mosquitoes collected in the field and transporting them to a central diagnostic facility for virus detection.

TI  - Sustainable utilization of mangroves using improved fish-smoking systems: a management perspective from the Douala-Edea wildlife reserve, Cameroon.
T2  - TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE
AB  - Fuel wood extraction for commercial fish smoking is the most pervasive threat to the sustainability of mangrove ecosystems in the Douala-Edea Wildlife Reserve (DEWR) of Cameroon and most West-Central African coastal states. The high rates of fuel-wood consumption are associated with fish smoking in this region and are chiefly the result of low fuel efficiency systems. In this study, we investigated the relative efficiency of two fish-smoking systems with respect to fuel wood consumption and time required for fish smoking in the DEWR. Using socio-economic and forest surveys in three villages, where mangrove wood is harvested and used, we established that the annual fuel-wood off-take was about 42,839m(3). In addition, most of the wood is used for fish smoking in the Traditional Smoke System (TSS) method, which was assessed to be 70% less efficient than the Improved Smoke System (Eeyed/CWCS). The Eeyed/CWCS consumed on average 50% less wood than the TSS, and reduced fish-smoking time by up-to 65% relative to the TSS. This comparative advantage offers opportunities for reducing the incidence of smoke-related diseases in women and children-most of them involved in the smoking process-by reducing the time spent smoking fish and saving money from avoided additional wood consumption. However, these benefits can only be achieved through the successful introduction of the Eeyed/CWCS. This will require a broad range of sensitization, capacity enhancement, and further research on adapting the current model to local conditions of the area.

AB  - The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect anti-Toxoplasma gondii antibodies in 1258 small ruminants (732 sheep and 526 goats) sampled from 28 different locations in the three ecological zones of Ghana. The animals sampled had an overall seroprevalence of 30.5% (384 of the total). Sheep had a higher overall prevalence (33.2%) compared to the goats (26.8%). Animals sampled from the Coastal Savannah and the Forest zones had prevalences of 39.4% and 39.1%, respectively, which were significantly higher (P < 0.01) than the prevalence recorded for the drier Guinea Savannah zone (20%). Prevalence of antibodies in female animals (35.8%) was significantly higher (P < 0.01) than that for males (21.1%). Significant differences were also observed between breeds and age groups. The ELISA was found to be both highly sensitive (92%) and specific (91%) when compared to the IFAT, which was used as a reference test. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Mangosteen Vinegar Rind from <i>Garcinia mangostana</i> Prevents High-Fat Diet and Streptozotocin-Induced Type II Diabetes Nephropathy and Apoptosis
T2  - JOURNAL OF FOOD SCIENCE
AB  - Type II diabetes (T2D) nephropathy, a major cause of end-stage kidney disease, progresses and develops from oxidative stress. Natural polyphenols can protect the kidney from diabetic nephropathy exerting antioxidant activities. The present approach enumerates the reno-protective and anti-apoptotic effects of mangosteen vinegar rind (MVR, a phenolic aqueous extract) against high-fat diet (5 g/day up to five weeks)-/streptozotocin (single ip, dose 30 mg/kgBW)-induced T2D nephropathy of albino mice. In vitro total phenolic content, 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) activity, 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) antioxidant capacity, and alpha-amylase inhibition activity as antidiabetic assay of MVR were performed. In vivo mice body weight, oral glucose, and maltose tolerance test, metabolic parameters (plasma glucose, insulin level, omeostasis model assessment-estimated insulin resistance), biochemical parameters (kidney hypertrophy, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine), oxidative stress parameters (malondialdehyde, superoxide dismutase, catalase) were estimated in an intervention study. Additionally, renal morphology and early apoptosis were observed following the H & E staining and TUNEL assay of the tissue frozen section. We found that the aqueous extract of MVR possesses potent in vitro antioxidative and antidiabetic activities. Animal intervention results showed that MVR 100, 200 mg/kgBW, and Glibenclamide 60 mg/kgBW treatments significantly improved (P < 0.05) the abovementioned parameters compared to the diabetic control group. Furthermore, treatments also significantly restored (P 0.05) kidney histological alterations and reduced cellular apoptosis compared to the diabetic control group. These findings concluded that MVR treatments significantly modulated the glucose intolerance, metabolic alterations, and oxidative stress-induced pathological alterations and cellular apoptosis of diabetic kidney. Practical Application Garcinia mangostana, a polyphenol rich natural product, is obtained from the tropical rain forest area of Southeast Asian countries and processes diverse biological activities including antioxidant, anti-proliferative, anti-inflammatory, anti-carcinogenic, and so on. This research first time focuses on the nephro-protective and anti-apoptotic effects of mangosteen vinegar rind (MVR) from the mangosteen fruit pericarp. Our study provides the efficient data to prove the beneficial effect of MVR as a dietary supplement for the prevention and management of diabetic nephropathy.

TI  - Lack of serological and molecular evidences of Zika virus circulation in non-human primates in three states from Brazil
T2  - MEMORIAS DO INSTITUTO OSWALDO CRUZ
AB  - BACKGROUND Zika virus (ZIKV) was discovered in 1947 with the virus isolation from Rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta) in Uganda forest, Africa. Old World Primates are involved in a sylvatic cycle of maintenance of this arbovirus, however a limited knowledge about the role of New World primates in ZIKV transmission cycles has been established.
   OBJECTIVE This work aimed to investigate the presence of enzootic circulation of ZIKV in New World Primates from three Brazilian states: Sao Paulo, Paraiba, and Parana.
   METHODS We analyzed 100 non-human primate samples collected in 2018 and 2020 from free-ranging and captive environments from Sao Paulo (six municipalities belonging to Sorocaba region), Paraiba (Joao Pessoa municipality), and Parana (Foz do Iguacu municipality) using reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase reaction (RT-qPCR) assays, indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT).
   FINDINGS All samples (n = 141) tested negative for the presence of ZIKV genome from tissue and blood samples. In addition, all sera (n = 58) from Foz do Iguacu' non-human primates (NHPs) were negative in serological assays.
   MAIN CONCLUSION No evidence of ZIKV circulation (molecular and serological) was found in neotropical primates. In addition, the absence of antibodies against ZIKV suggests the absence of previous viral exposure of NHPs from Foz do Iguacu-PR.

TI  - AN EPIDEMIOLOGIC SURVEY TO DISCOVER THE PROBABLE PLACES OF INFECTION WITH SLEEPING SICKNESS IN THE CENTRAL-AFRICAN-REPUBLIC
T2  - BULLETIN OF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION
AB  - The sleeping sickness focus at Nola-Bilolo in the forest region was the subject of a survey of 142 patients.in order to discover their probable places of infection. Seventy of these patients had been detected by active case-finding during a survey conducted in January-February 1991; the other 12 had been discovered by passive case-finding during 1990. The sample of actively detected patients is significantly younger (average 22 +/- 3 years) than the sample detected passively (30 +/- 3 years). This survey highlights the geographical heterogeneity of transmission in the focus. The places where infection is highest are M'Poyo, which with 18% of cases forms the epicentre of the focus and the main reservoir of infecting flies, followed by Bilolo (9%), Mekara (8%), Modigui-Kouna, Ziendi and Domissili (7%). The patients, 95% of whom belong to the M'Bimou tribe, all engage in agriculture; the main activities are coffee-growing for men and the steeping of cassava in the river for women. These two activities determine the main places and times of human-tsetse contact. The information obtained by listing the cases detected passively from medical registers is inadequate for locating the places of transmission. The information gathered during active case-finding campaigns by the mobile teams offers a better approach. The method used here, which is recommended, consists of matching the replies given by the patients about their points of contact with the tsetse flies, not just with their places of residence but also with their successive movements and their places of work. The rigour demanded by this kind of approach can only be ensured by a specific survey. This survey also made it possible to demonstrate subsantial movements from village to village, which appear to be characteristic of this focus. The results indicate that poorly targeted vector control is likely to be doomed to failure. The study makes it possible to specify priority areas for vector control by trapping and to avoid a ''blind'' control strategy whereby the whole focus is swamped with traps. The later strategy is not financially feasible for many countries of tropical Africa.

TI  - Can farmers and bats co-exist? Farmer attitudes, knowledge, and experiences with bats in Belize
T2  - HUMAN-WILDLIFE INTERACTIONS
AB  - Bats (Chiroptera) are often viewed negatively by the public. Negative public perceptions of bats may hinder efforts to conserve declining populations. In Belize, the presence of vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus and Diphylla ecaudata) exacerbates the potential for conflicts with humans because of the increased rabies transmission risks. To mitigate these risks, the Belize government provides farmers with assistance to trap and remove vampire bats. In June 2018, we surveyed farmers (n = 44) in and adjacent to the Vaca Forest Reserve in Belize to learn more about their attitudes, knowledge, and experiences with bats. This information may provide new insights and approaches to address farmers' concerns and enhance bat conservation efforts in Belize. Farmers held negative attitudes toward bats, exhibited low knowledge of their ecosystem services, and supported the trapping and use of toxicants to control bat populations to reduce the risk of rabies transmission between vampire bats and livestock. Farmers with livestock had more negative attitudes toward bats than farmers without livestock. Despite farmers reporting depredation incidences with fruit-eating and vampire bats, farmers expressed more negative attitudes toward vampire bats. We recommend that conservation education efforts target all stakeholders in the reserve to increase awareness about the importance of bats to ecosystems and highlight the dangers of indiscriminate trapping. Cumulatively, this may lead to positive attitude changes toward bats and their conservation.

TI  - Detection of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato in dogs and its ticks in rural communities of Yucatan, Mexico
T2  - REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL
AB  - In Mexico, the distribution and the presence of pathogenic genospecies of B. burgdorferi in dogs and their ticks has not been extensively investigated. The study of canine borreliosis is acquiring greater relevance, since the dog is considered to be an important sentinel for pathogens pertaining to the complex Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato; in addition, dogs could be playing a key role in the spread of ticks from forested areas into the domestic environment. This study aimed to detect and estimate the prevalence of B. burgdorferi s. l. in dogs and their ticks in two rural communities of Yucatan, Mexico. In each community, 50 houses were visited, where 144 blood samples from dogs were studied by puncture of the saphenous vein, as well as the collection of their ticks. To detect the presence of B. burgdorferi s. l. in these samples, the conserved gene flaB, p66 and ospC were PCR amplified. A total of 144 dog blood samples, and 846 of ticks were obtained from the examined animals. Considering tick species, Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato (786/846) was common, while Ixodes affinis (33/846), and Amblyomma mixtum (27/846) resulted less frequent. As per gene conservation, the prevalence of B. burgdorferi in canine blood was 17.3 % (25/144) to flaB, 12.50 % (18/144) for p66 and 1.38 % (2/144) for the ospC gene. Within the analyzed ticks, R. sanguineus s. l. had a prevalence of 0.89 %, A. mixtum 5.88 % and I. affinis 15.15 %, being this last species the one that presented higher prevalence. Two dogs and their ticks I. affinis were positive to the flaB gene. Only a tick R. sanguineus s. l. was positive to the gene p66 and no tick species was positive the ospC gene. This study confirmed the existence of B. burgdorferi s. l. in dogs and their ticks in rural communities of Yucatan, Mexico. The detection of Borrelia in dogs may be an important criterion for the evaluation of the risk of borreliosis in humans, since the dog can be used as an epidemiological indicator for the identification of new outbreaks of this disease.

TI  - Morphological and molecular analysis of six aphelenchoidoids from Australian conifers and their relationship to <i>Bursaphelenchus</i> (Fuchs, 1937)
T2  - NEMATOLOGY
AB  - Six isolates of Australian Aphelenchoidoidea, viz., Laimaphelenchus preissii from native coniferous Callitris preissii trees, L. australis from the common pine plantation trees of Pinus radiata and P. pinaster and L. heidelbergi and two morphospecies of Aphelenchoides (H1 and K1) and Cryptaphelenchus sp. (K2) from diseased P. radiata trees, were studied using light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and phylogenetic analyses of nearly full length sequences of SSU, D2/D3 expansion segments of LSU rDNA and a fragment of cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI). Bayesian phylogenetic analyses of SSU, LSU and COI of the six nematode species revealed that none of these Australian aphelenchoidoids was inferred to be closely related to Bursaphelenchus. The selected isolates of Aphelenchoides and Laimaphelenchus used in this study were paraphyletic in all molecular analyses. Cryptaphelenchus sp. (K2) was inferred to be sister to Seinura with SSU sequences.

TI  - Honokiol induces apoptosis-like death in <i>Cryptocaryon irritans</i> Tomont
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
AB  - Background Cryptocaryon irritans, a common parasite in tropical and subtropical marine teleost fish, has caused serious harm to the marine aquaculture industry. Honokiol was proven to induce C. irritans tomont cytoplasm shrinkage and death in our previous study, but the mechanism by which it works remains unknown.
   Methods In this study, the changes of apoptotic morphology and apoptotic ratio were detected by microscopic observation and AnnexinV-FITC/PI staining. The effects of honokiol on intracellular calcium ([ Ca2+]i) concentration, mitochondrial membrane potential (..m), reactive oxygen species (ROS), quantity of DNA fragmentations (QDF) and caspase activities were detected by Fluo-3 staining, JC-1 staining, DCFH-DA staining, Tunel method and caspase activity assay kit. The effects of honokiol on mRNA expression levels of 61 apoptosis-related genes in tomonts of C. irritans were detected by real-time PCR.
   Results The results of the study on the effects of honokiol concentration on C. irritans tomont apoptosis-like death showed that the highest levels of prophase apoptosis-like death rate (PADR), [Ca2+] i concentration, ROS, the activities of caspase-3/9 and the lowest necrosis ratio (NER) were obtained at a concentration of 1 mu g/ml, which was considered the most suitable for inducing C. irritans tomont apoptosis-like death. When C. irritans tomonts were treated with 1 mu g/ml honokiol, the [Ca2+] i concentration began to increase significantly at 1 h. Following this, the ROS, QDF and activities of caspase-3/9 began to increase significantly, and the..m began to decrease significantly at 2 h; the highest PADR was obtained at 4 h. The mRNA expression of 14 genes was significantly upregulated during honokiol treatment. Of these genes, itpr2, capn1, mc, actg1, actb, parp2, traf2 and fos were enriched in the pathway related to apoptosis induced by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress.
   Conclusions This article shows that honokiol can induce C. irritans tomont apoptosis-like death. These results suggest that honokiol may disrupt [Ca2+] i homeostasis in ER and then induce C. irritans tomont apoptosis-like death by caspase cascade or mitochondrial pathway, which might represent a novel therapeutic intervention for C. irritans infection.

TI  - Mapping critical areas for migratory songbirds using a fusion of remote sensing and distributional modeling techniques
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
AB  - Of the 338 species identified as Nearctic-Neotropical migrants occurring in North America, 98.5% have been recorded in Texas. The seasonal migration of these birds is a well-studied natural phenomenon individuals weighing < 15 g will cross in the Gulf of Mexico approximately 965 km non-stop, completing a total distance of 1900-3200 km over the course of 26-80 h. The physiologically demanding nature of this feat makes the Texas coastline crucial to the success of these species. We used a fusion of multi-spectral remote sensing data and distributional modeling techniques to generate and evaluate predictive maps identifying critical areas for migratory passerines on the Texas coast. Imagery acquired from Landsat 8 OLI, maps provided by United States Geological Survey and the Texas Department of Transportation, and migratory bird occurrence records from the eBird citizen-contributed database were used to build predictive distribution models using three algorithms. Using the AUC to compare model performance, the Random Forest produced the most accurate distribution model, followed by MaxEnt, and Support Vector Machine (0.98, 0.81, and 0.79, respectively). We interpreted, from Boosted Regression Tree analysis, that elevation is the single most influential factor in determining migrant occupancy, with vegetative biomass the least influential predictor. Our approach here allows conservation biologists a more sophisticated approach to identifying critical areas for migratory passerines across large spatial extents in a short amount of time.

TI  - Discovery of new potent hits against intracellular Trypanosoma cruzi by QSAR-based virtual screening
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY
AB  - Chagas disease is a neglected tropical disease (NTD) caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi and is primarily transmitted to humans by the feces of infected Triatominae insects during their blood meal. The disease affects 6-8 million people, mostly in Latin America countries, and kills more people in the region each year than any other parasite-born disease, including malaria. Moreover, patient numbers are currently increasing in non-endemic, developed countries, such as Australia, Japan, Canada, and the United States. The treatment is limited to one drug, benznidazole, which is only effective in the acute phase of the disease and is very toxic. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop new, safer, and effective drugs against the chronic phase of Chagas disease. Using a QSAR-based virtual screening followed by in vitro experimental evaluation, we report herein the identification of novel potent and selective hits against T. cruzi intracellular stage. We developed and validated binary QSAR models for prediction of anti-trypanosomal activity and cytotoxicity against mammalian cells using the best practices for QSAR modeling. These models were then used for virtual screening of a commercial database, leading to the identification of 39 virtual hits. Further in vitro assays showed that seven compounds were potent against intracellular T. cruzi at submicromolar concentrations (EC50 < 1 mu M) and were very selective (SI > 30). Furthermore, other six compounds were also inside the hit criteria for Chagas disease, which presented activity at low micromolar concentrations (EC50 < 10 mu M) against intracellular T. cruzi and were also selective (SI > 15). Moreover, we performed a multi-parameter analysis for the comparison of tested compounds regarding their balance between potency, selectivity, and predicted ADMET properties. In the next studies, the most promising compounds will be submitted to additional in vitro and in vivo assays in acute model of Chagas disease, and can be further optimized for the development of new promising drug candidates against this important yet neglected disease.

TI  - Avian Pox Discovered in the Critically Endangered Waved Albatross (<i>Phoebastria irrorata</i>) from the Galapagos Islands, Ecuador
T2  - JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE DISEASES
AB  - The Waved Albatross (Phoebastria irrorata) is a critically endangered seabird in a rapidly shrinking population in the Galapagos Islands, Ecuador. The introduction of novel pathogens and parasites poses a threat to population persistence. Monitoring disease prevalence and guarding against the spread of such agents in endemic taxa are conservation priorities for the Galapagos, where recent increases in the prevalence of avian pox may have contributed to population declines and range contractions in other bird species. During November 2013-January 2014, we identified 14 Waved Albatross nestlings at our study site on Espanola Island with avian pox-like lesions and clinical signs. Other seabirds, landbirds, and adult Waved Albatrosses were apparently unaffected. Histopathology of tissue samples from five infected nestlings revealed inclusion bodies in all samples, consistent with avipoxvirus infection. We documented higher mortality (6 of 14 nestlings) in affected nestlings than in unaffected young in this small outbreak of avian pox, the first report of its kind in the world's only tropical albatross.

TI  - A Novel MVA Vectored Chikungunya Virus Vaccine Elicits Protective Immunity in Mice
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background: Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a re-emerging arbovirus associated with febrile illness often accompanied by rash and arthralgia that may persist for several years. Outbreaks are associated with high morbidity and create a public health challenge for countries affected. Recent outbreaks have occurred in both Europe and the Americas, suggesting CHIKV may continue to spread. Despite the sustained threat of the virus, there is no approved vaccine or antiviral therapy against CHIKV. Therefore, it is critical to develop a vaccine that is both well tolerated and highly protective.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: In this study, we describe the construction and characterization of a modified Vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) virus expressing CHIKV E3 and E2 proteins (MVA-CHIK) that protected several mouse models from challenge with CHIKV. In particular, BALB/c mice were completely protected against viremia upon challenge with CHIKV after two doses of MVA-CHIK. Additionally, A129 mice (deficient in IFN alpha/beta) were protected from viremia, footpad swelling, and mortality. While high anti-virus antibodies were elicited, low or undetectable levels of neutralizing antibodies were produced in both mouse models. However, passive transfer of MVA-CHIK immune serum to naive mice did not protect against mortality, suggesting that antibodies may not be the main effectors of protection afforded by MVA-CHIK. Furthermore, depletion of CD4(+), but not CD8(+) T-cells from vaccinated mice resulted in 100% mortality, implicating the indispensable role of CD4(+) T-cells in the protection afforded by MVA-CHIK.
   Conclusions/Significance: The results presented herein demonstrate the potential of MVA to effectively express CHIKV E3-E2 proteins and generate protective immune responses. Our findings challenge the assumption that only neutralizing antibodies are effective in providing protection against CHIKV, and provides a framework for the development of novel, more effective vaccine strategies to combat CHIKV.

TI  - Paleoenvironments and paleoecology of the Santa Cruz Formation (early-middle Miocene) along the Rio Santa Cruz, Patagonia (Argentina)
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES
AB  - The continental early-middle Miocene Santa Cruz Formation (SCF) in Austral Patagonia contains the best record of South American mammalian faunas prior to the Great American Biotic Interchange (GABI) and is of particular interest because it is the best preserved high-latitude continental biotic record in the Southern Hemisphere spanning the mid-Miocene Climatic Optimum. Through intensive fieldwork we recovered numerous fossil vertebrates, mostly mammals, from the SCF along the Rio Santa Cruz (RSC), the type area for the formation and its fauna. We examine whether the SCF fauna differed among three distinct temporal intervals of the SCF spanning, from the oldest to youngest, the Atlantic coastal suite of localities Fossil Levels (FL) 1-7, at about 17.4 Ma, through localities in the RSC Barrancas Blancas (BB), between similar to 17.2 and similar to 16.3 Ma, and Segundas Barrancas Blancas (SBB), between similar to 16.5 and similar to 15.6 Ma. With the objective of reconstructing paleoenvironmental and community structure of these RSC faunas, we compared them with 55 extant lowland mammalian localities across South America from 8 degrees N to 55 degrees S latitude representing a wide range of seasonality and, annual rainfall and temperature, as well as canopy height and net primary productivity, sampling communities ranging from tropical rainforest to semi-arid steppe. Extant nonvolant mammalian genera at each locality were assigned a body size interval and niche parameters reflecting diet and substrate use, from behavioral data in the literature. Extinct genera were assigned similar niche metrics on the basis of their morphology. From the generic niche parameters, we compiled indices and ratios that express vectors of the community structure of each fauna, including the total number of genera, the pervasiveness of arboreality, frugivory, and browsing, and the relative richness of predators to their prey. The community structure variables were used to model community structure of the fossil localities based on uniformitarian principles. The fossil sample includes 44 genera of mammals from FL 1-7, 38 genera from BB, and 44 genera from SBB. The Simpson Coefficients of faunal similarity among the fossil localities are no greater than expected on the basis of the geographic distances among them, and do not suggest any apparent climatic differences. Based on the models we obtained no significant differences in MAP (Mean Annual Precipitation) for FL 1-7, BB and SBB, with mean estimates of 1635 mm, 1451 mm, and 1504 mm, with the confidence intervals for the estimates overlapping widely. MAT (Mean Annual Temperature) estimates are between similar to 21 degrees C and similar to 22 degrees C for FL 1-7 and SBB, possibly lower at 16 degrees C for BB, but with a wide and overlapping range of estimates. Temperature seasonality is modest (3 degrees C to 4 degrees C) and similar for all localities. Canopy heights exceed 20 m for all sites. Despite these geographic and inferred climatic similarities, the presence of certain key taxa (e.g., the caviomorph rodent Prolagostomus and the typothere Pachyrukhos) together with an increased overall abundance and richness of rodents with ever-growing cheek teeth suggests a trend to aridification in the upper part of the SCF at SBB compared with FL 1-7 and BB. Taken together, we propose that the SCF paleoenvironment consisted largely of semi-deciduous forests ranging into savannas with gallery-forest components.
   This range of habitats occurs today where the mesic inland Atlantic forests of Southern Brazil, northeastern Argentina and eastern Paraguay give way northwestward into the more xeric Paraguayan Gran Chaco. These interpretations are in general agreement with other sources of evidence from sedimentology, paleosols, isotopes, paleobotany and other faunal elements. We highlight the value of focusing paleoenvironmental and paleocological studies of the SFC on stratigraphically and geographically confined samples instead of on the entire temporal and geographic distribution of the SCF based on historical collections with limited provenance. The Santacrucian can be considered a model to the study of South American faunas after the arrival of hystricomorph rodents and anthropoid primates but before GABI.

TI  - Dengue risk assessment using multicriteria decision analysis: A case study of Bhutan
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   Dengue is the most rapidly spreading vector-borne disease globally, with a 30-fold increase in global incidence over the last 50 years. In Bhutan, dengue incidence has been on the rise since 2004, with numerous outbreaks reported across the country. The aim of this study was to identify and map areas that are vulnerable to dengue in Bhutan.
   Methodology/Principal findings
   We conducted a multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) using a weighted linear combination (WLC) to obtain a vulnerability map of dengue. Risk factors (criteria) were identified and assigned with membership values for vulnerability according to the available literature. Sensitivity analysis and validation of the model was conducted to improve the robustness and predictive ability of the map. Our study revealed marked differences in geographical vulnerability to dengue by location and season. Low-lying areas and those located along the southern border were consistently found to be at higher risk of dengue. The vulnerability extended to higher elevation areas including some areas in the Capital city Thimphu during the summer season. The higher risk was mostly associated with relatively high population density, agricultural and built-up landscapes and relatively good road connectivity.
   Conclusions
   Using MCDA, our study identified vulnerable areas in Bhutan during specific seasons when and where the transmission of dengue is most likely to occur. This study provides evidence for the National Vector-borne Disease Control programme to optimize the use of limited public health resources for surveillance and vector control, to mitigate the public health threat of dengue.
   Author summary
   Dengue is an important vector-borne viral disease affecting humans. In Bhutan, dengue incidence is on the rise with increased frequency of outbreaks and spread to new areas. Outbreaks were reported from places as high as above 900m above sea level in recent years. However, dengue control activities in Bhutan are usually initiated at the time of outbreaks. This often leads to a large number of cases and overburden the health system. To address these issues, we developed dengue risk maps at a fine spatial resolution by combining risk factors that mediate the transmission of dengue using a weighted linear combination. Vulnerability to dengue was spatially heterogeneous and varied by season. Dengue is highly vulnerable in low-lying areas throughout the season. However, the vulnerability extended to higher geographical elevations including the nation's capital during the summer season. The study provides a firm evidence-base to prioritize areas and seasons for dengue control strategies in Bhutan.

TI  - MAN-FLY CONTACT IN THE GAMBIAN TRYPANOSOMIASIS FOCUS OF NOLA-BILOLO (CENTRAL-AFRICAN-REPUBLIC)
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND PARASITOLOGY
AB  - A study using bipyramid tetse fly traps in the Nola-Bilolo sleeping sickness focus (Central African Republic) reveals ecological and behavioural differences between two vectors, Glossina palpalis palpalis and G. fuscipes fuscipes. The latter species inhabits mainly open water sites and surrounding forest, whereas G. p. palpalis occurs mainly in coffe plantations near villages. Consequently, the man-fly contact differs considerably according to the species. The intensity of trypanosomiasis transmission, estimated by the probable distribution of cases, showed significant positive correlation with the density of the flies. Analysis of the fly blood meals in two villages show that, unlike G. g. palpalis, G. f. fuscipes feeds on men more than on pigs. Trypanosoma vivax infection was observed only in G. fuscipes fuscipes. The differences in occupation of the environment between the two vectors must be taken in account in trapping programmes which may modify this distribution.

TI  - Ecological, Social and Biological Risk Factors for Continued <i>Trypanosoma cruzi</i> Transmission by <i>Triatoma dimidiata</i> in Guatemala
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Background: Chagas disease transmission by Triatoma dimidiata persists in Guatemala and elsewhere in Central America under undefined ecological, biological and social (eco-bio-social) conditions.
   Methodology: Eco-bio-social risk factors associated with persistent domiciliary infestation were identified by a cross-sectional survey and qualitative participatory methods. Quantitative and qualitative data were generated regarding Trypanosoma cruzi reservoirs and triatomine hosts. Blood meal analysis and infection of insects, dogs and rodents were determined. Based on these data, multimodel inference was used to identify risk factors for domestic infestation with the greatest relative importance (>0.75).
   Principal Findings: Blood meal analysis showed that 64% of 36 bugs fed on chickens, 50% on humans, 17% on dogs; 24% of 34 bugs fed on Rattus rattus and 21% on Mus musculus. Seroprevalence among 80 dogs was 37%. Eight (17%) of 46 M. musculus and three (43%) of seven R. rattus from households with infected triatomines were infected with T. cruzi Distinct Typing Unit I. Results from interviews and participatory meetings indicated that vector control personnel and some householders perceived chickens roosting and laying eggs in the house as bug infestation risk factors. House construction practices were seen as a risk factor for bug and rodent infestation, with rodents being perceived as a pest by study participants. Multimodel inference showed that house infestation risk factors of high relative importance are dog density, mouse presence, interior wall plaster condition, dirt floor, tile roofing and coffee tree presence.
   Conclusions/Significance: Persistent house infestation is closely related to eco-bio-social factors that maintain productive T. dimidiata habitats associated with dogs, chickens and rodents. Triatomine, dog and rodent infections indicate active T. cruzi transmission. Integrated vector control methods should include actions that consider the role of peridomestic animals in transmission and community members level of knowledge, attitudes and practices associated with the disease and transmission process.

TI  - GREATER MEKONG SUBREGION (GMS): CONTEXT
T2  - SOUTHEAST ASIAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - The epidemiology and outcome of malaria control initiatives are affected by a great diversity of factors including environment, economy and politics, to name but a few. Nowhere is this more obvious than in the GMS, where the rapid pace of economic development that has occurred over the past decade has brought with it a raft of changes to environment, employment, transport, communication, and demography and wealth patterns. The GMS, as a subregion, continues to gain increasing political and economic significance and has the potential to become one of the fastest growing regions in the world. While the pace of change is impressive, it has also brought with it new,challenges in the fight against malaria. On the one hand, improvement in transport networks such as roads and railways, facilitates increased cross-border trade and development, on the other hand such improvements are likely to result in a massive increase in population movements across borders. As travel becomes easier the numbers of migrant workers moving between areas of high and low transmission, also expands, further increasing the risk of the spread of resistant malaria strains. In addition, the increase in large infrastructure projects such as the construction of dams, as well as agricultural plantations, also potentially lead to changes in vector behavior with unknown consequences for malaria transmission. Effectively addressing the new challenges to malaria control will require renewed commitment, coordination and better collaboration between all sectors from governments and non government organizations in the GMS.

TI  - PATHOLOGY OF PERIPORTAL FIBROSIS INVOLUTION IN HUMAN SCHISTOSOMIASIS
T2  - REVISTA DO INSTITUTO DE MEDICINA TROPICAL DE SAO PAULO
AB  - Optical and electron microscopical evidences of focal matrix degradation were frequently seen in liver sections of periportal fibrosis caused by schistosomiasis mansoni in man. The material came from 14 wedge hepatic biopsies taken from patients with chronic advanced hepatosplenic disease and undergoing operations for the relief of portal hypertension. Besides the presence of focal areas of rarefaction, fragmentation and dispersion of collagen fibers, the enlarged portal spaces also showed hyperplasia of elastic tissue and disarray of smooth muscle fibers following destruction of portal vein branches.
   Eggs were scanty in the tissue sections, and matrix degradation probably represented involuting changes related to the progressive diminution of parasite-related aggression, which occurs spontaneously with age or after cure by chemotherapy. The changes indicative of matrix degradation now described are probably the basic morphological counterpart of periportal fibrosis involution currently being documented by ultrasonography in hepatosplenic patients submitted to curative chemotherapy.

TI  - Dealing with overprediction in species distribution models: How adding distance constraints can improve model accuracy
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
AB  - Species distribution models can be affected by overprediction when dispersal movement is not incorporated into the modelling process. We compared the efficiency of seven methods that take into account spatial constraints to reduce overprediction when using four algorithms for species distribution models. By using a virtual ecologist approach, we were able to measure the accuracy of each model in predicting actual species distributions. We built 40 virtual species distributions within the Neotropical realm. Then, we randomly sampled 50 occurrences that were used in seven spatially restricted species distribution models (hereafter called M-SDMs) and a non-spatially restricted ecological niche model (ENM). We used four algorithms; Maximum Entropy, Generalized Linear Models, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine. M-SDM methods were divided into a priori methods, in which spatial restrictions were inserted with environmental variables in the modelling process, and a posteriori methods, in which reachable and suitable areas were overlapped. M-SDM efficiency was obtained by calculating the difference in commission and omission errors between M-SDMs and ENMs. We used linear mixed-effects models to test if differences in commission and omission errors varied among the M-SDMs and algorithms. Our results indicate that overall M-SDMs reduce overprediction with no increase in underprediction compared to ENMs with few exceptions, such as a priori methods combined with the Support Vector Machine algorithm. There is a high variation in modelling performance among species, but there were only a few cases in which overprediction or underprediction increased. We only compared methods that do not require species dispersal data, guaranteeing that they can be applied to less-studied species. We advocate that species distribution modellers should not ignore spatial constraints, especially because they can be included in models at low costs but high benefits in terms of overprediction reduction.

TI  - Ethnobotany in the Maromizaha's protected area: Malagasy medicinal plants as source of phytochemicals for human health
T2  - INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON SURVEY OF USES OF PLANT GENETIC RESOURCES TO THE BENEFIT OF LOCAL POPULATIONS
CP  - International Symposium on Survey of Uses of Plant Genetic Resources to the Benefit of Local Populations
AB  - Most of the population in developing countries depends mainly on traditional medicine for the treatment of ailments. The dependence on remedies derived from medicinal plants is particularly important in these countries, as Madagascar, where modern medicine is often absent or simply too expensive: economic devaluation of the developing countries leads to higher prices of pharmaceuticals and makes medicinal plants and traditional medicine more attractive. Due to such long isolation and to its tropical location, Madagascar is characterized by one of the highest rates of endemism and biodiversity in the world. For this reason, it is not surprising that Malagasy flora can provide a wide variety of medicinal plants as an affordable alternative to expensive western medicine: it is important to characterize and valorize the Malagasy ethnobotanic biodiversity in order to preserve botanic and genetic information on medicinal endangered plants. The aim of this study was to obtain information from local population and collect plant material for phytochemical characterization in order to identify and quantify the main bioactive compounds and catalog oral botanic information avoiding the progressive loss of rural culture. For this reason, a survey on several Malagasy medicinal plants was carried out in the Maromizaha's protected area: information on 54 plant family (146 species) was obtained. These plants are usually used as decoction and infusion of the leaves, stems, bark, and other plant parts for the treatment of 40 different diseases.

TI  - The impact of climatic variables on the population dynamics of the main malaria vector, Anopheles stephensi Liston (Diptera: Culicidae), in southern Iran
T2  - ASIAN PACIFIC JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE
AB  - Objective: To determine the significance of temperature, rainfall and humidity in the seasonal abundance of Anopheles stephensi in southern Iran. Methods: Data on the monthly abundance of Anopheles stephensi larvae and adults were gathered from earlier studies conducted between 2002 and 2019 in malaria prone areas of southeastern Iran. Climatic data for the studied counties were obtained from climatology stations. Generalized estimating equations method was used for cluster correlation of data for each study site in different years. Results: A significant relationship was found between monthly density of adult and larvae of Anopheles stephensi and precipitation, max temperature and mean temperature, both with simple and multiple generalized estimating equations analysis (P<0.05). But when analysis was done with one month lag, only relationship between monthly density of adults and larvae of Anopheles stephensi and max temperature was significant (P<0.05). Conclusions: This study provides a basis for developing multivariate time series models, which can be used to develop improved appropriate epidemic prediction systems for these areas. Long-term entomological study in the studied sites by expert teams is recommended to compare the abundance of malaria vectors in the different areas and their association with climatic variables.

AB  - The neotropical genus Heamagogus Williston includes mosquitoes with diurnal activity and immature breeding on Phytotelmata (tree-holes and cut bamboo internodes). Haemagogus species have been involved in sylvatic yellow fever transmission, a virus circulating in forest areas in Latin America among arboreal primates and marsupials by means of mosquito bite. The genus comprises 28 species, nine of them occurring in Venezuela. One of these, Haemagogus (Comopostegus) clarki, is a new record for this country. We show here an update of the taxonomic status and the geographical distribution of the genus in Venezuela and the first photographical key using simple terms for non-expert personnel.

TI  - Short report:: Simultaneous occurrence of Dobrava, Puumala, and Tula hantaviruses in Slovakia
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - The prevalence of antibody to hantaviruses in Slovakia (serum panel n = 2,133) was lower in the western part (0.54%) and higher in the eastern part (1.91%) of the country and was found to be significantly enhanced in a group of forest workers from eastern Slovakia (5.88%). One-third of the IgM-negative convalescent phase sera from patients with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome exhibited antibodies reacting predominantly with Puumala virus antigen, while two-thirds had antibodies directed mainly against Hantaan virus antigen. Fine analysis of two Hantaan virus-reactive sera by a focus reduction neutralization test showed that Dobrava hantavirus was the source of these human infections. Initial results of rodent screening indicated the circulation of Dobrava virus in populations of striped field mice (Apodemus agrarius) in eastern Slovakia.

TI  - Epitypification of <i>Puccinia psidii</i>, Causal Agent of Guava Rust
T2  - TROPICAL PLANT PATHOLOGY
AB  - Puccinia psidii is an important pathogen considered a threat to plants of the Myrtaceae around the world. Morphological variability has created misunderstanding around the classification of this pathogen. Due to the obligately biotrophic nature of P. psidii, the age of the material on which the original description was based, and the poor condition of its DNA, there has been no clear genetic characterization of the species. An epitype is therefore designated for P. psidii for precise application of this taxon name. A morphological description and DNA characterization are provided from the epitype, obtained from the same location and host of the lectotype, also designated herein. Morphologically, the epitype is identical to the original material and phylogenetic and microsatellite analyses show that the epitype is representative of P. psidii from guava in Brazil.

T2  - MAGNETIC RESONANCE IN CHEMISTRY
AB  - Experimental 13C solid-state magic-angle spinning (MAS) Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) as well as Density-Functional Theory (DFT) gauge-including projector augmented wave (GIPAW) calculations were used to probe disorder and local mobility in diethylcarbamazine citrate, (DEC)+(citrate)-. This compound has been used as the first option drug for the treatment of filariasis, a disease endemic in tropical countries and caused by adult worms of Wuchereria bancrofti, which is transmitted by mosquitoes. We firstly present 2D 13C. 1H dipolar-coupling-mediated heteronuclear correlation spectra recorded at moderate spinning frequency, to explore the intermolecular interaction between DEC and citrate molecules. Secondly, we investigate the dynamic behavior of (DEC)+(citrate)-by varying the temperature and correlating the experimental MAS NMR results with DFT GIPAW calculations that consider two (DEC)+ conformers (in a 70: 30 ratio) for crystal structures determined at 293 and 235 K. Solid-state NMR provides insights on slow exchange dynamics revealing conformational changes involving particularly the DEC ethyl groups.

TI  - Impact of Yellow Fever Outbreaks on Two Howler Monkey Species (<i>Alouatta guariba clamitans</i> and <i>A</i>. <i>caraya</i>) in Misiones, Argentina
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY
AB  - Two yellow fever outbreaks (YFOs) ocurred in northeastern Argentina between November 2007 and October 2008, seriously affecting populations of two howler monkey species: the brown howler Alouatta guariba clamitans and the black howler Alouatta caraya. Both howlers live syntopically in El Pinalito Provincial Park, Misiones, where four groups (36 individuals) were studied since January 2005. The first dead howlers were found on January 20, 2008, in El Pinalito. Systematic searches found 14 dead howlers within the area (12 from the study groups and two from neighboring groups), with only two young seen on January 25, 2008, and none found since up to December 2008. In October 2008, another YFO hit howler monkey populations from El Soberbio, Misiones. Overall, 59 howlers were found dead in Misiones from November 2007 to December 2008. Thanks to the alert of the howler's death in El Pinalito, a prompt human vaccination campaign started in the area. Wild howler monkey populations from both species are in a delicate situation in Misiones, especially the brown howler, an already endangered species in Argentina and endemic to the Atlantic Forest. If we add the recurrence of YFOs to the reduction of suitable habitat to small fragments, it could be only a matter of time until howler populations disappear from the Upper Parana Atlantic Forest in Misiones.

TI  - Faunistic survey on Culicidae (Diptera) and their arboviruses in the area of a metropolis Cluj-Napoca, Romania
T2  - NORTH-WESTERN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY
AB  - A number of human and animal diseases can be caused by viruses, which are transmitted by arthropods (e.g. arthropod-borne virus). These arthropod vectors show a growing importance in many European countries, including Romania. Globalization and climate change creates favorable conditions for several exotic pathogens to enlarge their original ranges toward temperate regions. Our research aim is to reveal mosquito species which could be potential vectors of mosquito-borne viruses (e.g. mobovirus). hi this study, we are focusing on different wet ecosystems in a metropolis with important human concentration, such as Cluj-Napoca. Using a standard collection method (gravid traps), we performed a longitudinal survey to identify and describe mosquito communities as well as to detect moboviruses occurring in the area. During our work, molecular tools were used, such as pan-PCR and cell cultures. A total number of 728 Culicidae individuals were collected, belonging to 14 different species. We found 11 vector species, which are potential transmitters of mobovirus. Nine species are reported for the first time around Cluj-Napoca, based on our results. Coquiuettidia richiardii is reported here for the first time from Transylvania. The high number of Culicidae species identified in the area of Cluj Napoca is likely to be the result of the presence of a large variety of suitable habitats. Despite the high number of specimens collected, all samples were negative to arboviruses, thus the Culicidae fauna of the area show a low significance in medical importance.

TI  - The Indian cobra reference genome and transcriptome enables comprehensive identification of venom toxins
T2  - NATURE GENETICS
AB  - Snakebite envenoming is a serious and neglected tropical disease that kills 100,000 people annually. High-quality, genome-enabled comprehensive characterization of toxin genes will facilitate development of effective humanized recombinant antivenom. We report a de novo near-chromosomal genome assembly of Naja naja, the Indian cobra, a highly venomous, medically important snake. Our assembly has a scaffold N50 of 223.35 Mb, with 19 scaffolds containing 95% of the genome. Of the 23,248 predicted protein-coding genes, 12,346 venom-gland-expressed genes constitute the 'venom-ome' and this included 139 genes from 33 toxin families. Among the 139 toxin genes were 19 'venom-ome-specific toxins' (VSTs) that showed venom-gland-specific expression, and these probably encode the minimal core venom effector proteins. Synthetic venom reconstituted through recombinant VST expression will aid in the rapid development of safe and effective synthetic antivenom. Additionally, our genome could serve as a reference for snake genomes, support evolutionary studies and enable venom-driven drug discovery.

TI  - Ecology and Geography of Transmission of Two Bat-Borne Rabies Lineages in Chile
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Rabies was known to humans as a disease thousands of years ago. In America, insectivorous bats are natural reservoirs of rabies virus. The bat species Tadarida brasiliensis and Lasiurus cinereus, with their respective, host-specific rabies virus variants AgV4 and AgV6, are the principal rabies reservoirs in Chile. However, little is known about the roles of bat species in the ecology and geographic distribution of the virus. This contribution aims to address a series of questions regarding the ecology of rabies transmission in Chile. Analyzing records from 1985-2011 at the Instituto de Salud Publica de Chile (ISP) and using ecological niche modeling, we address these questions to help in understanding rabies-bat ecological dynamics in South America. We found ecological niche identity between both hosts and both viral variants, indicating that niches of all actors in the system are undifferentiated, although the viruses do not necessarily occupy the full geographic distributions of their hosts. Bat species and rabies viruses share similar niches, and our models had significant predictive power even across unsampled regions; results thus suggest that outbreaks may occur under consistent, stable, and predictable circumstances.
   Author Summary The situation of rabies in America has been changing: rabies in dogs has decreased considerably, but bats are increasingly documented as natural reservoirs of other rabies variants. A significant gap exists in understanding of bat-borne rabies in Latin America. We identified bat species known to be connected with enzootic rabies with different antigenic variants in Chile, and compiled large-scale data sets by which to test for ecological niche differences among virus lineages and bat hosts. Our results begin to characterize important ecological factors affecting rabies distribution; modeling rabies in Chile allows comparisons across different latitudes and diverse landscapes. We found that rabies virus strains are found in similar environments, regardless of the bat host involved. This research improves understanding of bat-borne rabies dynamics, and important step towards preventing and controlling this and other emergent diseases linked to bats.

TI  - Regulatory Frameworks for Clinical Trial Data Sharing: Scoping Review
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Although well recognized for its scientific value, data sharing from clinical trials remains limited. Steps toward harmonization and standardization are increasing in various pockets of the global scientific community This issue has gained salience during the COVID-19 pandemic. Even for agencies willing to share data, data exclusivity practices complicate matters; strict regulations by funders affect this even further. Finally, many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) have weaker institutional mechanisms. This complex of factors hampers research and rapid response during public health emergencies. This drew our attention to the need for a review of the regulatory landscape governing clinical trial data sharing.
   Objective: This review seeks to identify regulatory frameworks and policies that govern clinical trial data sharing and explore key elements of data-sharing mechanisms as outlined in existing regulatory documents. Following from, and based on, this empirical analysis of gaps in existing policy frameworks, we aimed to suggest focal areas for policy interventions on a systematic basis to facilitate clinical trial data sharing.
   Methods: We followed the JBI scoping review approach. Our review covered electronic databases and relevant gray literature through a targeted web search. We included records (all publication types, except for conference abstracts) available in English that describe clinical trial data-sharing policies, guidelines, or standard operating procedures. Data extraction was performed independently by 2 authors, and findings were summarized using a narrative synthesis approach.
   Results: We identified 4 articles and 13 policy documents; none originated from LMICs. Most (11/17, 65%) of the clinical trial agencies mandated a data-sharing agreement; 47% (8/17) of these policies required informed consent by trial participants; and 71% (12/17) outlined requirements for a data-sharing proposal review committee. Data-sharing policies have, a priori, milestone-based timelines when clinical trial data can be shared. We classify clinical trial agencies as following either controlled-or open-access data-sharing models. Incentives to promote data sharing and distinctions between mandated requirements and supportive requirements for informed consent during the data-sharing process remain gray areas, needing explication. To augment participant privacy and confidentiality, a neutral institutional mechanism to oversee dissemination of information from the appropriate data sets and more policy interventions led by LMICs to facilitate data sharing are strongly recommended.
   Conclusions: Our review outlines the immediate need for developing a pragmatic data-sharing mechanism that aims to improve research and innovations as well as facilitate cross-border collaborations. Although a one-policy-fits-all approach would not account for regional and subnational legislation, we suggest that a focus on key elements of data-sharing mechanisms can be used to inform the development of flexible yet comprehensive data-sharing policies so that institutional mechanisms rather than disparate efforts guide data generation, which is the foundation of all scientific endeavor.

TI  - Presence of <i>Lutzomyia</i> <i>longipalpis</i> (Diptera: Psychodidae) in the Parque Estadual da Serra da Tiririca, State of Rio de Janeiro, Southeastern Brazil
T2  - REVISTA DA SOCIEDADE BRASILEIRA DE MEDICINA TROPICAL
AB  - Introduction: The sand fly, Lutzomyia longipalpis, is the main vector of Leishmania infantum in the Americas, primarily occurring in areas of apparent anthropomorphic modifications in several regions of Brazil. Methods. Sand flies were captured using light traps. Results: Out of all captured species, Lu. longipalpis numbers had increased within the park. Conclusions: We report the occurrence of Lu. longipalpis in an area of Atlantic Forest, possibly representing the first sylvatic population of Lu. longipalpis in an area absent of peridomestic captures, but with the risk of L. infantum transmission in the areas of Niteroi and Marica.

TI  - Worrying News for Brazilian Caatinga: Prevalence of <i>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</i> in Amphibians
T2  - TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE
AB  - The chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) has been linked to the declines of more than 500 amphibian species globally. In Brazil, Bd has been identified in several regions but predominantly in the Atlantic Forest. Data on the occurrence of this amphibian pathogen in northeastern Brazil are scarce, specifically from the Caatinga ecoregion, where there is only one study that reports Bd in the region. This study is the first to show a high prevalence of Bd in Caatinga's species and includes two new records of species infected by Bd: Rhinella granulosa and R. jimi. In addition, we discuss the possibility of amphibian with terrestrial habits serving as potential Bd reservoirs in semiarid climate regions.

TI  - Assessing the Impact of Relapse, Reinfection and Recrudescence on Malaria Eradication Policy: A Bifurcation and Optimal Control Analysis
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE
AB  - In the present study, we propose and analyze an epidemic mathematical model for malaria dynamics, considering multiple recurrent phenomena: relapse, reinfection, and recrudescence. A limitation in hospital bed capacity, which can affect the treatment rate, is modeled using a saturated treatment function. The qualitative behavior of the model, covering the existence and stability criteria of the endemic equilibrium, is investigated rigorously. The concept of the basic reproduction number of the proposed model is obtained using the concept of the next-generation matrix. We find that the malaria-free equilibrium point is locally asymptotically stable if the basic reproduction number is less than one and unstable if it is larger than one. Our observation on the malaria-endemic equilibrium of the proposed model shows possible multiple endemic equilibria when the basic reproduction number is larger or smaller than one. Hence, we conclude that a condition of a basic reproduction number less than one is not sufficient to guarantee the extinction of malaria from the population. To test our model in a real-life situation, we fit our model parameters using the monthly incidence data from districts in Central Sumba, Indonesia called Wee Luri, which were collected from the Wee Luri Health Center. Using the first twenty months' data from Wee Luri district, we show that our model can fit the data with a confidence interval of 95%. Both analytical and numerical experiments show that a limitation in hospital bed capacity and reinfection can trigger a more substantial possibility of the appearance of backward bifurcation. On the other hand, we find that an increase in relapse can reduce the chance of the appearance of backward bifurcation. A non-trivial result appears in that a higher probability of recrudescence (treatment failure) does not always result in the appearance of backward bifurcation. From the global sensitivity analysis using a combination of Latin hypercube sampling and partial rank correlation coefficient, we found that the initial infection rate in humans and the mosquito infection rate are the most influential parameters in determining the increase in total new human infections. We expand our model as an optimal control problem by including three types of malaria interventions, namely the use of bed net, hospitalization, and fumigation as a time-dependent variable. Using the Pontryagin maximum principle, we characterize our optimal control problem. Results from our cost-effectiveness analysis suggest that hospitalization only is the most cost-effective strategy required to control malaria disease.

TI  - Phylogeny and temporal diversification of <i>Calomys</i> (Rodentia, Sigmodontinae):: Implications for the biogeography of an endemic genus of the open/dry biomes of South America
T2  - MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION
AB  - A thorough analysis of character evolution and biogeography of a group is only possible with a comprehensive sampling of its diversity. The sigmodontine genus Calomys is particularly interesting for the study of neotropical biogeography as it occurs exclusively in the dry and grassland biomes: Cerrado, Caatinga, Chaco, Pampas, Venezuelan Llanos, Puna, and a diversity of dry forests biomes. Although Brazil encompasses a large part of the geographic distribution of the genus and at least three endemic species, the last published phylogeny of Calomys included only two specimens (both representing the same species) from a single locality in this country. In the present paper we add complete cytochrome b sequences of Brazilian karyomorphs to previously published sequences in order to provide a phylogenetic hypothesis including most of the genus diversity. The main objectives of this study were to clarify taxonomic issues related to Brazilian karyomorphs and to study the diversification processes of the genus by analyzing its biogeography in combination with cladogenesis dates estimated with a molecular clock. The phylogeny indicates that at least six different species inhabit the Brazilian territory, one of them still undescribed. Date estimates indicate that two sequential basal splits, the first separating Andean from lowland species and the second isolating species north and south of the Amazonia, took place in the Pliocene between 3 and 4 Ma. A large-bodied and speciose clade of lowland species associated with dry forests and ecotones of the core Cerrado and Chaco areas with adjacent biomes diversified in the Pleistocene. This indicates the importance of safeguarding ecotones and the Cerrado at a time where this biome is being rapidly destroyed. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - <i>Aedes</i><i> albopictus</i> (Skuse) dispersion in Havana City, Cuba, 1995-2018
T2  - ACTA TROPICA
AB  - Various arboviruses are transmitted to humans by mosquitoes, particularly Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, two invasive and frequently sympatric species. The objective of this study was to evaluate the dispersion and the behavior of Ae. albopictus in relation to houses and its association with other mosquitoes in the province of Havana, Cuba. All water-containing deposits in the houses or vacant lots in urban and peri-urban municipalities of the province of Havana were sampled during the two study periods: 1995-1999 and 2010-2018. The following patterns in the presence of Ae. albopictus in the study area were observed: a persistent absence of Ae. albopictus in one of the municipalities; a rapid dispersion in the second period, staring from the absence of vector in the first period, in tow other municipalities; and a sustained decrease in the dispersion of Ae.albopictus in two other municipalities. The peripheral municipalities noted the highest presence of Ae. albopictus, but few asso-ciations with other mosquitoes. However, overall, we found an increase in this association when comparing the period 2010-2018 with the first period. Ae. albopictus was present in 8% (2016) to 21.5% (2013) inside the houses with an average of 15%, which evidences an initial domiciliation of the species. The results obtained in this work show an initiation of domiciliation of Ae. albopictus in the urban area of the province of Havana. This is important to alert the National Control Program to strengthen the entomological monitoring of Ae. albopictus, and not only Ae. aegypti. The follow-up of this domiciliation is important to guide control efforts, knowing its role as a vector of different arboviruses.

TI  - Integrating snake distribution, abundance and expert-derived behavioural traits predicts snakebite risk
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - Despite important implications for human health, distribution, abundance and behaviour of most medically relevant snakes remain poorly understood. Such data deficiencies hamper efforts to characterise the causal pathways of snakebite envenoming and to prioritise management options in the areas at greatest risk. We estimated the spatial patterns of abundance of seven medically relevant snake species from Sri Lanka, a snakebite hotspot, and combined them with indices of species' relative abundance, aggressiveness and envenoming severity obtained from an expert opinion survey, to test whether these fundamental ecological traits could explain spatial patterns of snakebite and envenoming incidence. The spatial intensity of snake occurrence records in relation to independent environmental factors (fundamental niches and land cover) was analysed with point process models. Then, with the estimated patterns of abundance, we tested which species' abundances added together, with and without weightings for aggressiveness, envenoming severity and relative abundance, best correlate with per capita geographic incidence patterns of snakebite and envenoming. We found that weighting abundance patterns by species' traits increased correlation with incidence. The best performing combination had three species weighted by aggressiveness and abundance, with a correlation of r = 0.47 (p < 0.01) with snakebite incidence. An envenoming severity and relative abundance-weighted combination of two species was the most strongly associated with envenoming incidence (r = 0.46, p = 0). Synthesis and applications. We show that snakebite risk is explained by abundance, aggressiveness and envenoming severity of the snake species most frequently involved in envenoming cases. Incorporating causality via ecological information of key snake species is critical for snakebite risk mapping, helping to tailor preventive measures for dominant snake species and deploying the necessary antivenom therapies.

TI  - High endemicity of alveolar echinococcosis in Yili Prefecture, Xingjiang Autonomous Region, the People's Republic of China: Infection status in different ethnic communities and in small mammals
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Author summary
   Alveolar echinococcosis (AE) is a neglected zoonosis caused by the larval stage of the fox/dog tapeworm Echinococcus multilocularis. In this study, we collected data on 286 AE cases reported from Yili Prefecture, Xinjiang Autonomous Region, the People's Republic of China from 1989 to 2015 with an annual incidence (AI) of 0.41/100,000. Among the patients, 73.08% were diagnosed in the last 11 years. The incidence (0.51-1.22 cases/100,000 residents) was higher in the high-altitude mountainous areas than those in low level areas (0.19-0.29/100,000 residents). In term of ethnic group, the AI of AE in Mongolian (2.06/100,000 residents) and Kazak (0.93/100,000) groups had higher incidence than the other ethnic groups, indicating sheep-farming activity is a risk for infection given that sheep farming is mainly practiced by these two groups in the prefecture. A total of 1411 small mammals were captured with 9.14% infected with E. multilocularis metacestodes. Microtus obscurus was the dominant species captured in the mountainous pasture areas with 15.01% infection rate, whereas Mus musculus and Apodemus sylvaticus were the dominant small mammals in the low altitude areas. Only 0.40% of A. sylvaticus were infected with E. multilocularis. These findings show that Yili Prefecture is a highly endemic area for AE and that the high-altitude pasture areas favorable for M. obscurus may play an important role in its transmission in this region.
   Alveolar echinococcosis (AE) is a life-threatening disease in humans caused by the larval stage of Echinococcus multilocularis. The tapeworm is transmitted between small mammals and dogs/foxes in the Northern Hemisphere. In this study 286 AE cases were reported from eight counties and one city in Yili Prefecture, Xinjiang Autonomous Region, the People's Republic of China from 1989 to 2015 with an annual incidence (AI) of 0.41/100,000. Among the patients, 73.08% were diagnosed in the last 11 years. Four counties in the high mountainous areas showed higher AI (0.51-1.22 cases//100,000 residents) than the four counties in low level areas (0.19-0.29/100,000 residents). The AI of AE in Mongolian (2.06/100,000 residents) and Kazak (0.93/100,000 residents) ethnic groups was higher than the incidence in other ethnic groups indicating sheep-farming is a risk for infection given this activity is mainly practiced by these two groups in the prefecture. A total of 1411 small mammals were captured with 9.14% infected with E. multilocularis metacestodes. Microtus obscurus was the dominant species in the mountain pasture areas with 15.01% of the voles infected, whereas Mus musculus and Apodemus sylvaticus were the dominant small mammals in the low altitude areas. Only 0.40% of A. sylvaticus were infected with E. multilocularis. PCR amplification and sequencing analysis of the mitochondrial cox1 gene showed that E. multilocularis DNA sequences from the small mammals were identical to isolates of local human AE cases. The overall results show that Yili Prefecture is a highly endemic area for AE and that the high-altitude pasture areas favorable for M. obscurus may play an important role in its transmission in this region.

TI  - Revisiting human T-cell lymphotropic virus types 1 and 2 infections among rural population in Gabon, central Africa thirty years after the first analysis
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - HTLV-1 infection is considered as highly endemic in central Africa. Thirty years ago, a first epidemiological study was performed in Gabon, central Africa, and revealed that the prevalence varied from 5.0 to 10.5%. To evaluate current distribution of HTLVs in Gabon, 4.381 samples were collected from rural population living in 220 villages distributed within the 9 provinces of country. HTLVs prevalence was determined using two ELISA tests and positive results were confirmed by Western Blot. The overall HTLV-1 seroprevalence was of 7.3% among the rural Gabonese population; with 5.4% for men and 9.0% for women. Prevalence of HTLV-1 differed by province, ranging from 2.3% to 12.5% into the rain forest. Being a woman older than 51 years represented a high risk for HTLV-1 acquisition. Hospitalization, operation/surgery, transfusion and medical abortion or fever, arthritis and abdominal pain are also significant risk factors. In addition, 0.1% of samples were found as HTLV-2 positive, while 12.0% had an indeterminate HTLV serological pattern. HTLV-3 and HTLV-4 were not found. Phylogenetic analysis was performed on 87 samples and demonstrated that HTLV-1 present in Gabon belongs mostly to subtype B, however the rare subtype D was also found. Altogether, our results demonstrate that almost thirty years after the first epidemiological study prevention of HTLVs infection is still an issue in Gabon.

TI  - Leishmanicidal activity of the root bark of <i>Erythrophleum Ivorense</i> (Fabaceae) and identification of some of its compounds by ultra-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF-MS/MS)
T2  - JOURNAL OF ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY
AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Leishmaniasis is one of the neglected tropical disease caused by a protozoan of the genus Leishmania transmitted by sandflies. High cost and lack of oral formulation of existing drugs, rapid developments of resistance by the parasite coupled with serious side effects require new treatments to augment or replace currently available therapies. The major merits of herbal medicine seem to demonstrate perceived efficacy, low incidence of serious adverse effects and low cost. Erythrophleum plants possess beneficial biological properties and, as such, characterization of the bioactive components of these plants is imperative. Previous work has shown an overwhelming presence of cassaine alkaloids in these plants. However, amongst these plants, the African based specie (Erythrophleum ivorense) is the least studied.
   Objective: In the current study, the in vitro anti-leishmanial activity of the crude extract, its fractions and isolated compounds were evaluated using direct counting assay of promastigotes of Leishmania donovani using amphotericin B as positive control.
   Materials and methods: The anti-leishmanial activity of E. ivorense extract was evaluated in vitro against the promastigote forms of Leishtnania Donovani using a direct counting assay based on growth inhibition. Different crude extracts from ethyl acetate, pet-ether, and methanol as well as pure isolated compounds of E. ivorense: Erythroivorensin, Eriodictyol and Betulinic acid were screened. To know the possible components of the active methanolic extract, attempt was made to elucidate the extract using ultra-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF-MS/MS).
   Results: This afforded a weak pet-ether fraction, a moderately active ethyl acetate fraction and a significantly active methanol fraction (IC50 = 2.97 pg/mL) compared to Amphotericin B (IC50 = 2.40 +/- 0.67 sg/mL). The novel diterpene erythroivorensin, betulinic acid and the flavanone Eriodictyol, from the ethyl acetate fraction, showed weak activity. UPLC-QTOF-MS/MS was used to identify the cassaine diterpenoids from the active methanol fraction. Here, 10 compounds of this type were putatively identified from the ethanol crude extract.
   Conclusion: The fragmentation mechanism of these metabolites is also proposed and are expected to serve as reference template for identification of these and related compounds in future. The presence of these compounds is an indication that they are an inherited and evolutionary component of plants belonging to the Erythrophleum genus. Our results further present another dimension where these compounds and their relative abundances can be used as chemo-taxonomical bio-markers of the genus. The present study also successfully demonstrated/reaffirmed the use of UPLC-QTOF-MS/MS as a robust technique for the characterization of natural products.

TI  - Dual role of an essential HtrA2/Omi protease in the human malaria parasite: Maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis and induction of apoptosis-like cell death under cellular stress
T2  - PLOS PATHOGENS
AB  - Members of the HtrA family of serine proteases are known to play roles in mitochondrial homeostasis as well as in programmed cell death. Mitochondrial homeostasis and metabolism are crucial for the survival and propagation of the malaria parasite within the host. Here we have functionally characterized a Plasmodium falciparum HtrA2 (PfHtrA2) protein, which harbours trypsin-like protease activity that can be inhibited by its specific inhibitor, ucf-101. A transgenic parasite line was generated, using the HA-glmS C-terminal tagging approach, for localization as well as for inducible knock-down of PfHtrA2. The PfHtrA2 was localized in the parasite mitochondrion during the asexual life cycle. Genetic ablation of PfHtrA2 caused significant parasite growth inhibition, decreased replication of mtDNA, increased mitochondrial ROS production, caused mitochondrial fission/fragmentation, and hindered parasite development. However, the ucf-101 treatment did not affect the parasite growth, suggesting the non-protease/chaperone role of PfHtrA2 in the parasite. Under cellular stress conditions, inhibition of PfHtrA2 by ucf-101 reduced activation of the caspase-like protease as well as parasite cell death, suggesting the involvement of protease activity of PfHtrA2 in apoptosis-like cell death in the parasite. Under these cellular stress conditions, the PfHtrA2 gets processed but remains localized in the mitochondrion, suggesting that it acts within the mitochondrion by cleaving intra-mitochondrial substrate(s). This was further supported by transexpression of PfHtrA2 protease domain in the parasite cytosol, which was unable to induce any cell death in the parasite. Overall, we show the specific roles of PfHtrA2 in maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis as well as in regulating stress-induced cell death.
   Author summary
   Malaria remains to be one of the major life-threatening diseases, especially affecting children in tropical and subtropical regions. Identification of key metabolic pathways in the parasite is a prerequisite to develop new drugs. Malaria parasite harbours a single mitochondrion that harbour several metabolic pathways important for parasite survival. Further, mitochondrion also play role in programmed cell death (PCD) of the parasite under consistence stress conditions. Here we have identified a unique enzyme, HtrA2, localized in the parasite mitochondria; we show that this enzyme plays a dual role in maintenance of parasite mitochondria under normal conditions, as well as regulation of PCD under cellular stress conditions. We also show mechanism of activation of this enzyme under cellular stress conditions, which in turn activates Caspase like-enzymes in the parasite, key enzymes responsible for PCD. These results reveal important roles of the HtrA2 enzyme in the malaria parasite, and thus this enzyme can be targeted to design new anti-malarials.

TI  - Living on the edge: Fig tree phenology at the northern range limit of monoecious <i>Ficus</i> in China
T2  - ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
AB  - Fig trees (Ficus) are a species-rich group of mainly tropical and subtropical plants that are of ecological importance because of the large numbers of vertebrates that utilise their figs for food. Factors limiting their distributions to warmer regions are still poorly understood, but are likely to include factors linked to their specialised pollination biology, because each Ficus species is dependent on one or a small number of host-specific fig wasps (Agaonidae) for pollination. Adult fig wasps are short-lived, but some species are capable of dispersing extremely long distances to pollinate their hosts. Close to its northern range limit we investigated the phenology of Ficus virens, the monoecious fig tree that reaches furthest north in China. Relatively few trees produced any figs, and very few retained figs throughout the winter. Despite this, new crops produced in spring were pollinated, with seasonally migrant pollinators from plants growing further south the most likely pollen vectors. An inability to initiate new crops at low temperatures may limit the distribution of monoecious fig trees to warmer areas. (c) 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

TI  - Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) for 291 diseases and injuries in 21 regions, 1990-2010: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010
T2  - LANCET
AB  - Background Measuring disease and injury burden in populations requires a composite metric that captures both premature mortality and the prevalence and severity of ill-health. The 1990 Global Burden of Disease study proposed disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) to measure disease burden. No comprehensive update of disease burden worldwide incorporating a systematic reassessment of disease and injury-specific epidemiology has been done since the 1990 study. We aimed to calculate disease burden worldwide and for 21 regions for 1990, 2005, and 2010 with methods to enable meaningful comparisons over time.
   Methods We calculated DALYs as the sum of years of life lost (YLLs) and years lived with disability (YLDs). DALYs were calculated for 291 causes, 20 age groups, both sexes, and for 187 countries, and aggregated to regional and global estimates of disease burden for three points in time with strictly comparable definitions and methods. YLLs were calculated from age-sex-country-time-specific estimates of mortality by cause, with death by standardised lost life expectancy at each age. YLDs were calculated as prevalence of 1160 disabling sequelae, by age, sex, and cause, and weighted by new disability weights for each health state. Neither YLLs nor YLDs were age-weighted or discounted. Uncertainty around cause-specific DALYs was calculated incorporating uncertainty in levels of all-cause mortality, cause-specific mortality, prevalence, and disability weights.
   Findings Global DALYs remained stable from 1990 (2.503 billion) to 2010 (2.490 billion). Crude DALYs per 1000 decreased by 23% (472 per 1000 to 361 per 1000). An important shift has occurred in DALY composition with the contribution of deaths and disability among children (younger than 5 years of age) declining from 41% of global DALYs in 1990 to 25% in 2010. YLLs typically account for about half of disease burden in more developed regions (high-income Asia Pacific, western Europe, high-income North America, and Australasia), rising to over 80% of DALYs in sub-Saharan Africa. In 1990, 47% of DALYs worldwide were from communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional disorders, 43% from non-communicable diseases, and 10% from injuries. By 2010, this had shifted to 35%, 54%, and 11%, respectively. Ischaemic heart disease was the leading cause of DALYs worldwide in 2010 (up from fourth rank in 1990, increasing by 29%), followed by lower respiratory infections (top rank in 1990; 44% decline in DALYs), stroke (fifth in 1990; 19% increase), diarrhoeal diseases (second in 1990; 51% decrease), and HIV/AIDS (33rd in 1990; 351% increase). Major depressive disorder increased from 15th to 11th rank (37% increase) and road injury from 12th to 10th rank (34% increase). Substantial heterogeneity exists in rankings of leading causes of disease burden among regions.
   Interpretation Global disease burden has continued to shift away from communicable to non-communicable diseases and from premature death to years lived with disability. In sub-Saharan Africa, however, many communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional disorders remain the dominant causes of disease burden. The rising burden from mental and behavioural disorders, musculoskeletal disorders, and diabetes will impose new challenges on health systems. Regional heterogeneity highlights the importance of understanding local burden of disease and setting goals and targets for the post-2015 agenda taking such patterns into account. Because of improved definitions, methods, and data, these results for 1990 and 2010 supersede all previously published Global Burden of Disease results.

TI  - Perspective Piece Response to the Critique by Hahn and Others Entitled "Conservation and Malaria in the Brazilian Amazon"
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Hahn and others have recently criticized our study, "Conservation efforts may increase malaria burden in the Brazilian Amazon," suggesting that results were flawed because of methodological limitations. Here, we briefly comment on some of their claims, showing that (1) several of their criticisms are misleading and others are incorrect, (2) they heavily criticize methods that they themselves have previously used, and (3) they selectively highlight some findings while ignoring others. We end this rebuttal by suggesting a way forward in this debate.

TI  - Rapid and quantitative detection of citrus huanglongbing bacterium <i>'Candidatus</i> Liberibacter asiaticus' by real-time fluorescent loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay in China
T2  - PHYSIOLOGICAL AND MOLECULAR PLANT PATHOLOGY
AB  - Huanglongbing (HLB) is a devastating citrus disease that is associated with bacteria of the species 'Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (Las)' in China. All currently popular cultivars are susceptible to HLB, and there are no effective approaches to control the disease once the plants have been infected. Therefore, rapid and easy diagnostic tools are needed for maintaining clean nursery stock and inoculum removal strategies to control HLB. A real-time fluorescence loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RealAmp) targeting16S rDNA was developed for the rapid and quantitative detection of Las in China. The detection sensitivity of the RealAmp assay was approximately 1 pg/mu l template DNA (equal to 2.4 x 10(5) target DNA copies/mu l) and no cross-reaction was observed with other pathogens or virus-free seedlings. Besides the quantitative detection using SYTO-9 fluorescent dye, an improved closed-tube visual inspection technique using SYBR Green I staining was developed for rapid screening of samples and minimize the risk of cross-contamination. The RealAmp assay is an alternative quantitative method, which would be used as a routine detection service for nursery materials in China. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - <i>Mycoplasma</i> sp infection in captive Marcgrave's capuchin monkeys (<i>Sapajus flavius</i>)
T2  - COMPARATIVE IMMUNOLOGY MICROBIOLOGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB  - Three species of hemoplasmas are known to infect monkeys, 'Candidatus Mycoplasma kahanei', 'Candidatus Mycoplasma haemomacaque' and 'Candidatus Mycoplasma aoti'. Marcgrave's capuchin monkey (Sapajus flavius) is a critically endangered neotropical primate species of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, and thus, sustained efforts are needed to protect the health and well-being of these animals. This study has aimed to screen 12 captive S. flavius from the State of Paraba, northeastern Brazil, for hemoplasma infection. Packed cell volume (PCV) was measured and a pan-hemoplasma PCR protocol performed. A total of 8/12 (66.6%) monkeys were positive for the 16S rDNA gene of Mycoplasma sp., showing an identity of 99% to Mycoplasma sp. previously detected in Sapajus apella and Sapajus sp. monkeys from the Brazilian Amazon. Further studies should be conducted in order to elucidate whether this potentially novel Mycoplasma sp. is able to cause anemia in Sapajus sp. monkeys from Brazil.

TI  - SOIL SICKNESS AND NEGATIVE PLANT-SOIL FEEDBACK: A REAPPRAISAL OF HYPOTHESES
T2  - JOURNAL OF PLANT PATHOLOGY
AB  - Soil sickness (SS) is the rise of negative conditions for plant vegetative and reproductive performances induced into the soil by the plant itself. In natural ecosystems, plant ecologists refer to SS as negative plant-soil feedback (NPSF). Scope of this review is to provide an updated picture of the current SS understanding by an explicit comparison between agro-ecosystems and natural plant communities. By an extensive analysis of literature we found that SS is pervasive in agro-ecosystems, occurring in 111 cultivated plants belonging to 41 taxonomic families. Concerning NPSF in natural plant communities, we found evidence of this phenomenon for a total of 411 vascular plants belonging to 72 plant families. NPSF occurs in most of the terrestrial ecosystems, including tropical and temperate forests, coastal sand dunes, old fields and grassland, deserts, as well as heathland and tundra. Three main hypotheses have been proposed to explain SS: (i) soil nutrient depletion or imbalance; (ii) buildup of soilborne pathogen and parasite populations, coupled with a shift in soil microbial community composition; (iii) release of phytotoxic and autotoxic compounds during decomposition of crop residues. Evidences from both agroecosystems and natural plant communities undoubtedly ruled out the nutrient deficiency as a primary causal factor. Moreover, the massive use of mineral fertilizers, especially under intensive cultivation systems, appears an incorrect strategy that only exacerbates the decline of soil quality by inducing acidification and salinization. Soilborne pathogens are often isolated from symptomatic plants and many autotoxic compounds have been identified and quantified from sick soil. However, both the pathogenic and autotoxicity hypotheses are still unable to fully explain the species-specificity, as well as the long durability of SS observed in field conditions. The recent discovery that extracellular DNA (exDNA) has self-inhibitory effects, support the autotoxicity hypothesis, nevertheless this is a totally new topic, and more solid and systematic field investigations are needed. A better understanding of the causes of SS is a necessary step to develop eco-friendly solutions to overcome this problem.

TI  - An animal model for studying the pathogenesis of chikungunya virus infection
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Newborn and 14-day-old mice inoculated subcutaneously with chikungunya virus (CHIKV) developed lethargy, difficulty walking, dragging of hind limbs, and reduced weight gain within 7-10 days after infection (PI). During the initial 6-7 days PI, the animals had viremia; high levels (10(6)-10(8) PFU) of CHIKV were also present in leg muscle. The virus persisted in muscle for several days after viremia disappeared. The major histopathologic changes were in skeletal muscle, which were focal necrosis and inflammation, followed by fibrosis and dystrophic calcification. Some mice also showed dystrophic calcification in the joint cartilage, but there were few deaths, and most of the animals eventually recovered. CHIKV antigen was shown by immunohistochemistry in the muscle for several weeks after infection. Based on the clinical and pathologic similarities with CHIKV infection in humans, young ICR and CD-1 mice offer a useful and realistic model for further study of the pathogenesis and treatment of CHIKV infection.

TI  - Biological Flora of the British Isles: <i>Ruscus aculeatus</i>
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
AB  - 1. This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of Ruscus aculeatus L. (Butcher's broom) that are relevant to understanding its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and disease, history and conservation.
   2. Ruscus aculeatus is a multistemmed monocotyledonous shrub with leaves functionally replaced by cladodes and photosynthetic stems. It is native to southern England primarily in dry shaded woodland and hedgerows (but widely planted elsewhere) often, but not exclusively, on base-rich soil. It is rarely abundant in any habitat, usually forming widely spread discrete clumps.
   3. Ruscus aculeatus is remarkably shade tolerant and drought resistant with low water conductance and transpiration, and water storage in the cladodes. Yet unusually for a drought-tolerant stem-photosynthetic plant, it prefers shady environments.
   4. The flowers have few if any pollinating mechanisms, low seed production and fruit/seed dispersal are largely ineffective, which may be a relict of its evolution in a tropical Tertiary climate. Population survival primarily depends upon vegetative spread from stout rhizomes, aided by the plant's general unpalatability.
   5. Over-collecting for medicinal steroidal saponins has caused some population declines, particularly in eastern Europe, but it is otherwise facing few conservation problems.

TI  - Ross River virus in Australian blood donors: possible implications for blood transfusion safety
T2  - TRANSFUSION
AB  - BACKGROUNDEmerging transfusion-transmissible pathogens, including arboviruses such as West Nile, Zika, dengue, and Ross River viruses, are potential threats to transfusion safety. The most prevalent arbovirus in humans in Australia is Ross River virus (RRV); however, prevalence varies substantially around the country. Modeling estimated a yearly risk of 8 to 11 potentially RRV-viremic fresh blood components nationwide. This study aimed to measure the occurrence of RRV viremia among donors who donated at Australian collection centers located in areas with significant RRV transmission during one peak season.
   STUDY DESIGN AND METHODSPlasma samples were collected from donors (n=7500) who donated at the selected collection centers during one peak season. Viral RNA was extracted from individual samples, and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was performed.
   RESULTSRegions with the highest rates of RRV transmission were not areas where donor centers were located. We did not detect RRV RNA among 7500 donations collected at the selected centers, resulting in a zero risk estimate with a one-sided 95% confidence interval of 0 to 1 in 2019 donations.
   CONCLUSIONOur results suggest that the yearly risk of collecting a RRV-infected blood donation in Australia is low and is at the lower range of previous risk modeling. The majority of Australian donor centers were not in areas known to be at the highest risk for RRV transmission, which was not taken into account in previous models based on notification data. Therefore, we believe that the risk of RRV transfusion transmission in Australia is acceptably low and appropriately managed through existing risk management, including donation restrictions and recall policies.

TI  - A Systematic Review of the Epidemiology of Echinococcosis in Domestic and Wild Animals
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background: Human echinococcosis is a neglected zoonosis caused by parasites of the genus Echinococcus. The most frequent clinical forms of echinococcosis, cystic echinococcosis (CE) and alveolar echinococcosis (AE), are responsible for a substantial health and economic burden, particularly to low-income societies. Quantitative epidemiology can provide important information to improve the understanding of parasite transmission and hence is an important part of efforts to control this disease. The purpose of this review is to give an insight on factors associated with echinococcosis in animal hosts by summarising significant results reported from epidemiological studies identified through a systematic search.
   Methodology and Principal Findings: The systematic search was conducted mainly in electronic databases but a few additional records were obtained from other sources. Retrieved entries were examined in order to identify available peer-reviewed epidemiological studies that found significant risk factors for infection using associative statistical methods. One hundred studies met the eligibility criteria and were suitable for data extraction. Epidemiological factors associated with increased risk of E. granulosus infection in dogs included feeding with raw viscera, possibility of scavenging dead animals, lack of anthelmintic treatment and owners' poor health education and indicators of poverty. Key factors associated with E. granulosus infection in intermediate hosts were related to the hosts' age and the intensity of environmental contamination with parasite eggs. E. multilocularis transmission dynamics in animal hosts depended on the interaction of several ecological factors, such as hosts' population densities, host-prey interactions, landscape characteristics, climate conditions and human-related activities.
   Conclusions/Significance: Results derived from epidemiological studies provide a better understanding of the behavioural, biological and ecological factors involved in the transmission of this parasite and hence can aid in the design of more effective control strategies.

TI  - SEROLOGICAL EVIDENCE IN SHEEP SUGGESTING PHLEBOVIRUS CIRCULATION IN A RIFT-VALLEY FEVER ENZOOTIC AREA IN BURKINA-FASO
T2  - TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Within the Phlebovirus serogroup, Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus is endemo-enzootic in the African sahelian zone. Recently an RVF epizootic in West Africa prompted a serosurvey in the major sheep and cattle raising areas. Because of the close antigenic relationship between the phleboviruses it appeared of interest to evaluate the prevalence of the other phleboviruses also. In 1987, 482 sheep serum samples were collected in 2 different ecological zones of Burkina Faso and tested for the presence of phlebovirus antibodies. A sensitive but non-specific immunofluorescent antibody test and a specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used, with the following African phlebovirus antigens: Rift Valley fever (RVF), Arumowot, Gabek Forest, Gordil, Saint Floris and Odrenisrou. A total of 15.8% of the sera sampled had anti-RVF antibody in the ELISA. RVF virus appeared to be more active in drier areas such as the sahelian region, known to be an enzootic area for the disease. Antibodies to other phleboviruses were found in 11.8% of the samples, independent of RVF virus activity. It is asumed that sheep can be infected by different phleboviruses.

TI  - Specific PCR-based detection of <i>Phomopsis heveicola</i> the cause of leaf blight of <i>Coffee</i> (<i>Coffea arabica</i> L.) in China
T2  - LETTERS IN APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Coffee (Coffea arabica L.) is currently grown in many tropical and subtropical areas countries and is a major traded commodity for the developing world. Coffee leaf blight, caused by Phomopsis heveicola, is one of the most important fungal diseases dangerous to coffee crops in China. This study aimed to develop a PCR-based diagnostic method for detecting P. heveicola in planta. Specific primers (CPHF/CPHR) were designed based on sequence data of region of internal transcribed spacer (ITS1 and ITS4) of P. heveicola. The efficiency and specificity of CPHF/CPHR were established by PCR analysis of DNA from P. heveicola strains isolated from China and fungal isolates of other genera. A single amplification product of 318 bp was detected from DNA P. heveicola isolates. No amplification product was observed with any of the other fungal isolates tested. The specific primers designed and employed in PCR detected P. heveicola up to 3 pg from DNA isolated. This is the first report on the development of a species-specific PCR assay for identification and detection of P. heveicola. Thus, the PCR-based assay developed was very specific, rapid and sensitive tool for the detection of pathogen P. heveicola.

TI  - Spatial distribution of Culex mosquito abundance and associated risk factors in Hanoi, Vietnam
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Japanese encephalitis (JE) is the major cause of viral encephalitis (VE) in most AsianPacific countries. In Vietnam, there is no nationwide surveillance system for JE due to lack of medical facilities and diagnoses. Culex tritaeniorhynchus, Culex vishnui, and Culex quin-quefasciatus have been identified as the major JE vectors in Vietnam. The main objective of this study was to forecast a risk map of Culex mosquitoes in Hanoi, which is one of the most densely populated cities in Vietnam. A total of 10,775 female adult Culex mosquitoes were collected from 513 trapping locations. We collected temperature and precipitation information during the study period and its preceding month. In addition, the other predictor variables (e.g., normalized difference vegetation index [NDVI], land use/land cover and human population density), were collected for our analysis. The final model selected for estimating the Culex mosquito abundance included centered rainfall, quadratic term rainfall, rice cover ratio, forest cover ratio, and human population density variables. The estimated spatial distribution of Culex mosquito abundance ranged from 0 to more than 200 mosquitoes per 900m2. Our model estimated that 87% of the Hanoi area had an abundance of mosquitoes from 0 to 50, whereas approximately 1.2% of the area showed more than 150 mosquitoes, which was mostly in the rural/peri-urban districts. Our findings provide better insight into understanding the spatial distribution of Culex mosquitoes and its associated environmental risk factors. Such information can assist local clinicians and public health policymakers to identify potential areas of risk for JE virus. Risk maps can be an efficient way of raising public awareness about the virus and further preventive measures need to be considered in order to prevent outbreaks and onwards transmission of JE virus.

TI  - Genome sequencing of <i>Rigidoporus microporus</i> provides insights on genes important for wood decay, latex tolerance and interspecific fungal interactions
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Fungal plant pathogens remain a serious threat to the sustainable agriculture and forestry, despite the extensive efforts undertaken to control their spread. White root rot disease is threatening rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis) plantations throughout South and Southeast Asia and Western Africa, causing tree mortality and severe yield losses. Here, we report the complete genome sequence of the basidiomycete fungus Rigidoporus microporus, a causative agent of the disease. Our phylogenetic analysis confirmed the position of R. microporus among the members of Hymenochaetales, an understudied group of basidiomycetes. Our analysis further identified pathogen's genes with a predicted role in the decay of plant cell wall polymers, in the utilization of latex components and in interspecific interactions between the pathogen and other fungi. We also detected putative horizontal gene transfer events in the genome of R. microporus. The reported first genome sequence of a tropical rubber tree pathogen R. microporus should contribute to the better understanding of how the fungus is able to facilitate wood decay and nutrient cycling as well as tolerate latex and utilize resinous extractives.

TI  - Small subunit ribosomal metabarcoding reveals extraordinary trypanosomatid diversity in Brazilian bats
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   Bats are a highly successful, globally dispersed order of mammals that occupy a wide array of ecological niches. They are also intensely parasitized and implicated in multiple viral, bacterial and parasitic zoonoses. Trypanosomes are thought to be especially abundant and diverse in bats. In this study, we used 18S ribosomal RNA metabarcoding to probe bat trypanosome diversity in unprecedented detail.
   Methodology/Principal Findings
   Total DNA was extracted from the blood of 90 bat individuals (17 species) captured along Atlantic Forest fragments of Espirito Santo state, southeast Brazil. 18S ribosomal RNA was amplified by standard and/or nested PCR, then deep sequenced to recover and identify Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) for phylogenetic analysis. Blood samples from 34 bat individuals (13 species) tested positive for infection by 18S rRNA amplification. Amplicon sequences clustered to 14 OTUs, of which five were identified as Trypanosoma cruzi I, T. cruzi III/V, Trypanosoma cruzi marinkellei, Trypanosoma rangeli, and Trypanosoma dionisii, and seven were identified as novel genotypes monophyletic to basal T. cruzi clade types of the New World. Another OTU was identified as a trypanosome like those found in reptiles. Surprisingly, the remaining OTU was identified as Bodo saltans-closest non-parasitic relative of the trypanosomatid order. While three blood samples featured just one OTU (T. dionisii), all others resolved as mixed infections of up to eight OTUs.
   Conclusions/Significance
   This study demonstrates the utility of next-generation barcoding methods to screen parasite diversity in mammalian reservoir hosts. We exposed high rates of local bat parasitism by multiple trypanosome species, some known to cause fatal human disease, others non-pathogenic, novel or yet little understood. Our results highlight bats as a long-standing nexus among host-parasite interactions of multiple niches, sustained in part by opportunistic and incidental infections of consequence to evolutionary theory as much as to public health.

TI  - Genetics and Environmental Factors Associated with Resistance to <i>Fusarium graminearum</i>, the Causal Agent of Gibberella Ear Rot in Maize
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
AB  - Maize is one of the most important food and feed sources at the worldwide level. Due to this importance, all the pathogens that can infect this crop can harm both food safety and security. Fungi are the most important pathogens in cultivated maize, and Fusarium spp. are one of the most important families. Reduction in yield and production of dangerous mycotoxins are the main effects of Fusarium spp. infection. Fusarium graminearum (part of the Fusarium graminearum species complex) is one the most important fungi that infect maize, and it is the causative agent of Gibberella ear rot (GER). The main characteristics of this species include its ability to infect various species and its varying infection pressures across different years. This fungus produces various harmful mycotoxins, such as deoxynivalenol, zearalenone, butanolide, and culmorin. Infection can start from silk channels or from ear wounds. In the first case, the environmental conditions are the most important factors, but in the second, a key role is played by the feeding action of lepidopteran larvae (in Europe, Ostrinia nubilalis). All these factors need to be taken into account to develop a successful management strategy, starting from cropping methods that can reduce the source of inoculum to the direct control of the fungus with fungicide, as well as insect control to reduce ear wounds. But, the most important factor that can reduce the effects of this fungus is the use of resistant hybrids. Different studies have highlighted different defensive methods developed by the plant to reduce fungal infections, like fast drying of silk and kernels, chemical compounds produced by the plant after infection, and mechanical protection from insects' wounds. The aim of this paper is to review the scientific evidence of the most important management strategies against GER in maize and to highlight the genetic basis which is behind hybrid resistance to this disease, with a focus on genes and QTLs found in studies conducted across the world and with different types of maize from tropical cultivars to European flint.

TI  - The effect of insecticide-treated bed nets on the incidence and prevalence of malaria in children in an area of unstable seasonal transmission in western Myanmar
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
AB  - Background: Insecticide-treated bed nets (ITN) reduce malaria morbidity and mortality consistently in Africa, but their benefits have been less consistent in Asia. This study's objective was to evaluate the malaria protective efficacy of village-wide usage of ITN in Western Myanmar and estimate the cost-effectiveness of ITN compared with extending early diagnosis and treatment services.
   Methods: A cluster-randomized controlled trial was conducted in Rakhine State to assess the efficacy of ITNs in preventing malaria and anaemia in children and their secondary effects on nutrition and development. The data were aggregated for each village to obtain cluster-level infection rates. In total 8,175 children under 10 years of age were followed up for 10 months, which included the main malaria transmission period. The incidence and prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax infections, and the biting behaviour of Anopheles mosquitoes in the area were studied concurrently. The trial data along with costs for current recommended treatment practices were modelled to estimate the cost-effectiveness of ITNs compared with, or in addition to extending the coverage of early diagnosis and treatment services.
   Results: In aggregate, malaria infections, spleen rates, haemoglobin concentrations, and weight for height, did not differ significantly during the study period between villages with and without ITNs, with a weighted mean difference of -2.6 P. falciparum episodes per 1,000 weeks at risk (95% Confidence Interval -7 to 1.8). In areas with a higher incidence of malaria there was some evidence ITN protective efficacy. The economic analysis indicated that, despite the uncertainty and variability in their protective efficacy in the different study sites, ITN could still be cost-effective, but not if they displaced funding for early diagnosis and effective treatment which is substantially more cost-effective.
   Conclusion: In Western Myanmar deployment of ITNs did not provide consistent protection against malaria in children living in malaria endemic villages. Early diagnosis and effective treatment is a more cost effective malaria control strategy than deployment of ITNs in this area where the main vector bites early in the evening, often before people are protected by an ITN.

TI  - Sero-prevalence of visceral leishmaniasis and its associated factors among asymptomatic individuals visiting Denan health center, southeastern Ethiopia
T2  - TROPICAL DISEASES TRAVEL MEDICINE AND VACCINES
AB  - BackgroundIn the Somali region of Ethiopia, visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a public health concern. However, VL epidemiology and sand fly vectors have not been well studied in various areas of the regional state, including Denan district. Therefore, this study was conducted to determine the sero-prevalence, associated factors, and distribution of sand fly vectors of VL in Denan district, south-eastern Ethiopia.MethodsA facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted from April to September 2021 among VL patients with classic signs and symptoms visiting Denan Health Center in south-eastern Ethiopia. Using a convenience sampling method, 187 blood samples were collected from individuals who visited Denan Health Center during the study period. Blood samples were subjected to Direct Agglutination Test for the detection of antibodies to VL. A pre-tested structured questionnaire was also used to gather information on risk factors and other characteristics of knowledge and attitude assessment. Sand flies were also collected from indoor, peri-domestic, mixed forest, and termite mounds using light and sticky traps to determine the fauna and abundance.ResultsThe overall sero-prevalence rate was 9.63% (18/187). The sero-prevalence was significantly associated with outdoor sleeping (OR = 2.82), the presence of damp floors (OR = 7.76), and sleeping outdoor near animals (OR = 3.22). Around 53.48% of the study participants had previously heard about VL. Study participants practiced different VL control methods, including bed nets (42%), insecticide spraying (32%), smoking plant parts (14%), and environmental cleaning (8%). In total, 823 sand fly specimens, comprising 12 species in two genera (Phlebotomus and Sergentomyia), were trapped and identified. The most abundant species was Sergentomyia clydei (50.18%), followed by Phlebotomus orientalis (11.42%). Also, a higher proportion of P. orientalis was found in termite mounds (65.43%), followed by mixed forest (37.8%) and peri-domestic (20.83%) habitats.ConclusionThe study demonstrated a 9.63% sero-positivity of VL and a remarkable gap in knowledge, attitude, and practices towards VL. P. orientalis was also detected, which could be a probable vector in this area. Thus, public education should be prioritized to improve the community's awareness of VL and its public health impact. In addition, detailed epidemiological and entomological studies are recommended.

TI  - <i>NATURAL MORTALITY FACTORS OF THE NEOTROPICAL Symphyta</i> Haplostegus nigricrus (<i>Hymenoptera</i>: <i>Pergidae</i>)
T2  - BIOSCIENCE JOURNAL
AB  - The main natural mortality factors of Haplostegus nigricrus Conde (Hymenoptera: Symphyta: Pergidae) present in a secondary forested area in the municipality of Vicosa, Minas Gerais, Brazil, are described. Adults were sampled monthly for one year by sweeping vegetation, and their numbers correlated with temperature and rainfall. Natural enemies were recorded from larvae and adults under both laboratory and field conditions and include predators, parasitoids, viruses, and fungi. Natural enemies were not observed in the egg and adult phases and the pupae viability was even less under laboratory conditions. Haplostegus nigricrus is bivotine, and its life cycle strongly coincides with both. The low occurrence of natural enemies, the high egg viability, and the strong correlation to regional abiotic factors suggest that this species has high adaptability to habitats composed of native Myrtaceae of economic importance in Brazil.

TI  - The distribution of M and S molecular forms of <i>Anopheles gambiae</i> in Nigeria
T2  - TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - The distribution of M and S molecular forms of Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto across Nigeria was determined. The molecular form of 40 to 45 specimens per locality from 9 localities was determined using mostly the same specimens from our recent study of genetic differentiation of A. gambiae across Nigeria (Onyabe & Conn, 2001). These samples were previously genotyped at 10 microsatellite loci, 5 located within chromosome inversions and 5 outside inversions. Both molecular forms occurred throughout the country, with no apparent relationship to the ecological transition from dry savannah in the north to humid forest in southern Nigeria. In all localities, however, I form or the other occurred virtually exclusively. No hybrids between forms were found. Across all loci, FST values were as high within molecular forms as between forms. Regardless of molecular form, FST values calculated across loci within inversions were much higher (range 0.0016 to 0.1988) than those calculated across loci outside inversions (range -0.0035 to 0.0260). Genetic distance was not significantly correlated with geographical distance within either form (P > 0.05). These observations suggest that, in addition to partial reproductive barriers between molecular forms, selection is a major factor shaping genetic differentiation of A. gambiae across Nigeria.

TI  - Breeding site fidelity of the critically endangered toad<i> Atelopus</i><i> cruciger</i> (Anura: Bufonidae): implications for its conservation
T2  - SALAMANDRA
AB  - Harlequin Toads (Bufonidae: Atelopus) are among the most diverse Neotropical amphibians, but 84% of the known species are threatened with extinction mainly due to the fungal disease chytridiomycosis. With no effective tools to mitigate chytridiomycosis in the wild being available, captive breeding is currently the only option to ensure the long-term survival of many Harlequin Toad species. However, the life history and ecology of most species is still largely unknown. Using spatially explicit capture-recapture data from 2005-2013, we studied breeding habitat use and reproductive phenology of the critically endangered Rancho Grande Harlequin Toad, Atelopus cruciger. This species is a seasonal breeder that reproduces exclusively during the dry season. Adult males and females, but also juveniles, migrate from the forest to the river at the beginning of the dry season and return to the forest as soon as the rainy season begins, although a few adult males may remain on the riverbank throughout the year. Despite these seasonal displacements, the toads return to the same locations on the riverbank every year. Both female and male adult toads exhibit a strong breeding site fidelity, oc-cupying small areas (= 5 m(2)) along the river margins. Adults were mainly active on rocky substrate and vegetation during the day, with males occupying significantly more elevated spots closer to the stream than females. Male territories tend to overlap, but we observed no aggressive or territorial defence behaviour. We discuss the implications of habitat use and high site fidelity for in situ and ex situ conservation measures of this critically endangered toad.

TI  - Pathways to improve nutrition security through horticulture in a coffee based farming system: the case of 'Yayu' biosphere reserve area of Ethiopia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIA ON TROPICAL AND TEMPERATE HORTICULTURE - ISTTH2016
CP  - International Symposia on Tropical and Temperate Horticulture (ISTTH)
AB  - In Ethiopia, horticultural crops offer a strong pathway to nutrition security. However, leveraging this potential requires a shift from a mono-cropping system to a more diversified production system. Integrating appropriate horticultural crops into farming systems appears to be feasible, increasing nutrition security, diversifying and intensifying agriculture and reducing pressure on natural habitats in biodiversity hotspots. The objectives of this paper are to analyze vegetable value chains and to examine the performance of actors in the chain as well as to assess and analyze the challenges and opportunities for vegetable production, marketing and consumption. The study was undertaken in two districts (Yayu and Hurumu) of the Yayu biosphere reserve area. Data were collected from both primary and secondary sources. The study identified that vegetable crops have a comparative nutrition security advantage over the production of other crops and can offer alternatives to the coffee-based economy. However, vegetable crop development is constrained by a multitude of technological, socio-economic and institutional challenges. The major challenges are: the lack of diversified or nutrition-sensitive farming systems; lack of improved technologies; weak collaboration between agricultural and health offices; traditional management practices; pests and diseases; poor postharvest management; and a lack of knowledge in nutrition-sensitive value chain approaches. There is a need to reshape the current production system into a more nutrition-diversified system. In addition, changing traditional production practices and beliefs about vegetables through intensive social behavioral change strategies are of paramount importance. Moreover, there is a need to strengthen vertical and horizontal linkages between vegetable value chain actors in the study area.

TI  - The little fire ant, <i>Wasmannia auropunctata</i>:: Distribution, impact, and control
T2  - SOCIOBIOLOGY
AB  - The little fire ant, Wasmannia auropunctata, has been increasing in importance as an exotic pest. Here we review published and unpublished information on its distribution, ecology, impact, and control. Wasmannia auropunctata occurs throughout most of the warmer parts of the New World, from subtropical Argentina to subtropical Mexico and through much of the Caribbean, though it is not clear whether this species is native to this entire region. During the past century, exotic populations of W. auropunctata have become established in numerous other places, including the Galapagos Islands, West Africa (Gabon, Cameroon, and possibly the Republic of Congo and the Democratic Republic of Congo), Melanesia (New Caledonia, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, and possibly Tuvalu), Polynesia (Wallis and Futuna and Hawaii), the mainland US (Florida and possibly California), and on subtropical Atlantic islands (the Bahamas and Bennuda). The latitudinal range of known outdoors populations of W. auropunctata is from 32degrees40'S in Argentina to 32degrees20'N in Bermuda. Wasmannia auropunctata is also a greenhouse pest in more temperate regions, such as England and Canada. In many areas, W. auropunctata can be a significant agricultural pest, not only stinging agricultural workers, but also enhancing populations of Homoptera. Homoptera cause damage both through sapping plants of nutrients and by increasing the occurrence of diseases, including viral and fungal infections. In addition, W. auropunctata has negative impacts on many animals, both invertebrates and vertebrates, though most reports on such impact have been anecdotal. The impacts of W. auropunctata populations seem to be most severe on tropical islands where it is not native, such as the Galapagos, New Caledonia, and the Solomon Islands. Reports of widespread blindness in both domestic and native mammals caused by W. auropunctata stings deserve serious attention. Chemical control of W auropunctata may be possible for small exotic populations spread over a few dozen hectares or less. For large exotic infestations, the only hope for long-term control appears to be classical biocontrol.

T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL PEDIATRICS
AB  - In February 2016, the World Health Organization declared Zika virus (ZIKV) infection a public health emergency of international concern, given the precipitous spread of the virus across the Americas. Unlike arboviruses such as Chikungunya and Dengue, which have also recently emerged in the western hemisphere, ZIKV was identified in communities where concurrent neurologic conditions such as microcephaly and Guillain-Barre (GB) syndrome were occurring at alarming rates. Thus, investigations to systematically evaluate the link between ZIKV, congenital malformations (including microcephaly) and GB syndrome remain a top priority.

TI  - Contribution of transgenic <i>Casuarinaceae</i> to our knowledge of the actinorhizal symbioses
T2  - SYMBIOSIS
CP  - 15th International Frankia and Actinorhizal Plant Meeting
AB  - The Casuarinaceae family is a group of 96 species of trees and shrubs that are tolerant to adverse soil and climatic conditions. In the field, Casuarinaceae bears nitrogen-fixing root nodules (so called actinorhizal nodules) resulting from infection by the soil actinomycete Frankia. The association between Casuarina and Frankia is of tremendous ecological importance in tropical and subtropical areas where these trees contribute to land stabilization and soil reclamation. During differentiation of the actinorhizal nodule, a set of genes called actinorhizal nodulins is activated in the developing nodule. Understanding the molecular basis of actinorhizal nodule ontogenesis requires molecular tools such as genomics together with gene transfer technologies for functional analysis of symbiotic genes. Using the biological vectors Agrobacterium rhizogenes and A. tumefaciens, gene transfer into the two species Allocasuarina verticillata and Casuarina glauca has been successful. Transgenic Casuarinaceae plants proved to be valuable tools for exploring the molecular mechanisms resulting from the infection process of actinorhizal plants by Frankia.

TI  - Bee populations, genetic diversity, conservation, marketing and contribution to rural households in Kenya: a review
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TROPICAL INSECT SCIENCE
AB  - World demand for honey and hive products is in excess of marketed production. In Africa, honey is the most important hive product and is the main driver of producers venturing in beekeeping. Despite the enormous demand for honey both locally and internationally, production is still below potential and this is attributable to multiple challenges. They include lack of Apiculture policy, decline in the number of bee colonies, habitat destruction, and lack of data on bee population trends, low key conservation strategies and absence of structured marketing of honey and hive products. Data on pollinator populations and production trends in Kenya is scarce. The present work aims to critically examine the current state of honey bees and stingless bee production, marketing, conservation, diseases, recording and contribution to rural households in Kenya. Strategies to overcome the challenges and achieve more sustainable bee production are discussed. The number of bee colonies in Kenya has reduced by 16.76% whereas national average honey production per hive has increased from 3.77 kg/hive/year to 13.38 kg/hive for the last ten years. Seven species of stingless bees and three subspecies of Honey bees are recognised in Kenya. Forest fires, habitat destruction, pesticide use, and climate change are the major threats to these pollinators. Conservation programs in Africa do not target bees per se but forests. The establishment of bee conservation programs that involve rural communities is critical for the preservation of the genetic diversity of bee populations. Establishment of honey hubs for bulking and marketing honey and hive products is a viable option in marketing apicultural products and also an incentive for conservation. Enactment of apiculture policy and a paradigm shift in land use systems, climate change mitigation strategies, providing alternative livelihood options and involvement of rural communities are key in reversing the effects of low apiculture productivity.

TI  - Historical relationships among Argentinean biogeographic provinces based on mygalomorph spider distribution data (Araneae: Mygalomorphae)
T2  - STUDIES ON NEOTROPICAL FAUNA AND ENVIRONMENT
AB  - The present study used the previously defined biogeographic provinces from Argentina as the starting point for a parsimony analysis of endemicity and cluster analysis. The goal of the study was to use a dataset of distributional patterns of mygalomorph spiders from Argentina to evaluate the historical relationships of the biogeographic provinces. The analyses showed the following relationships: Yungas and Puna; Pampa and Chaco, Monte and Prepuna; Parana Forest and Araucaria angustifolia Forest; Central and Subandean Patagonia. Biogeographical regionalizations are useful as general reference models and their heuristic value should be explored by examining the geographical distribution of other taxa.

TI  - Onchocerciasis Transmission in Ghana: Persistence under Different Control Strategies and the Role of the Simuliid Vectors
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   The World Health Organization (WHO) aims at eliminating onchocerciasis by 2020 in selected African countries. Current control focuses on community-directed treatment with ivermectin (CDTI). In Ghana, persistent transmission has been reported despite long-term control. We present spatial and temporal patterns of onchocerciasis transmission in relation to ivermectin treatment history.
   Methodology/Principal Findings
   Host-seeking and ovipositing blackflies were collected from seven villages in four regions of Ghana with 3-24 years of CDTI at the time of sampling. A total of 16,443 flies was analysed for infection; 5,812 (35.3%) were dissected for parity (26.9% parous). Heads and thoraces of 12,196 flies were dissected for Onchocerca spp. and DNA from 11,122 abdomens was amplified using Onchocerca primers. A total of 463 larvae (0.03 larvae/fly) from 97 (0.6%) infected and 62 (0.4%) infective flies was recorded; 258 abdomens (2.3%) were positive for Onchocerca DNA. Infections (all were O. volvulus) were more likely to be detected in ovipositing flies. Transmission occurred, mostly in the wet season, at Gyankobaa and Bosomase, with transmission potentials of, respectively, 86 and 422 L3/person/month after 3 and 6 years of CDTI. The numbers of L3/1,000 parous flies at these villages were over 100 times the WHO threshold of one L3/1,000 for transmission control. Vector species influenced transmission parameters. At Asubende, the number of L3/1,000 ovipositing flies (1.4, 95% CI = 0-4) also just exceeded the threshold despite extensive vector control and 24 years of ivermectin distribution, but there were no infective larvae in host-seeking flies.
   Conclusions/Significance
   Despite repeated ivermectin treatment, evidence of O. volvulus transmission was documented in all seven villages and above the WHO threshold in two. Vector species influences transmission through biting and parous rates and vector competence, and should be included in transmission models. Oviposition traps could augment vector collector methods for monitoring and surveillance.

TI  - The Effects of Harvest Maturity on Storage Quality and Sucrose-Metabolizing Enzymes During Banana Ripening
T2  - FOOD AND BIOPROCESS TECHNOLOGY
AB  - Mature green "Baxi" banana (Musa spp. AAA Group, Cavendish) fruits were harvested at 60% and 80% maturity stages. In order to evaluate the effects of harvesting at different maturity stages on storage quality and changes in sucrose-metabolizing enzymes, fruit firmness, disease index, contents of starch, and total soluble sugars were determined, and enzyme activities associated with sucrose metabolism was investigated under natural and accelerated (treated with ethylene) ripening conditions. In fruit treated with ethylene, changes in flesh firmness, total sugar content, starch content, disease index, and activity of sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS), sucrose synthase (SS), acid invertase (AI), and neutral invertase (NI) were accelerated dramatically compared with untreated fruit with both 60% and 80% maturity. When fruit ripened under natural conditions, the changes in firmness, disease index, starch content, total sugar content, SPS activity, SS, AI, and NI activity in fruit with 80% maturity were significantly faster than those in fruit with 60% maturity. On the contrary, when fruit ripened under accelerated conditions, no significant differences in firmness, sugar, starch, disease index, SPS, SS, AI, and NI were observed between fruit harvested at 60% or 80% maturity. It is suggested that storage quality and sucrose-metabolizing enzymes of banana fruit stored under natural conditions are related to harvest maturity stage; storage quality of fruit with lower harvest maturity is better than fruit with higher maturity. However, when fruit ripening is accelerated by ethylene, the harvest maturity stage has no influence on storage quality and changes in sucrose-metabolizing enzymes.

TI  - Community structure of Neotropical wetland insects in Northern Venezuela. II. Habitat type and environmental factors
T2  - ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE
AB  - This study examined the spatial distribution of wetland insects in relation to selected environmental variables in northeastern Venezuela. Sampling was carried out over two sampling periods (rainy and dry season) in seven wetland types (brackish and freshwater herbaceous swamps, mangrove swamps, freshwater ponds, clear-cut marsh forests, small irrigation canals, and swamp forests), covering three environmental gradients (salinity, aquatic vegetation type, and habitat permanence). Using the partial redundancy analysis, we determined that occurrence and abundance of insects was significantly (P<0.05) accounted for by the relative contributions of pure environmental (29-34%) and habitat type-related (12-15%) variations among wetlands. Water chemistry (salinity), wetland trophic state (phytoplankton), habitat heterogeneity (aquatic vegetation type), and habitat physical features (depth and habitat permanence) were significantly associated to community structure. Insect richness was higher in the less saline, more vegetated, and less temporary wetlands. Our findings add to previous results suggesting that adversity, productivity, heterogeneity and permanence of the habitat represent important axes along which Neotropical wetland insect communities are organized.

TI  - Survey of community knowledge, attitudes, and practices during a malaria epidemic in central Java, Indonesia
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - We surveyed adults in a randomly selected sample of 1,000 households in 50 villages in nine malarial sub-districts in Purworejo, central Java, Indonesia from May to July 2001. The survey assessed malaria knowledge, attitudes, and practices in communities experiencing epidemic malaria to begin exploring broad strategies for controlling the disease in the region. A pre-tested survey instrument consisting of 93 questions addressed demographic characteristics, socioeconomic factors, knowledge and perceptions of malaria, burden and severity of disease, treatment-seeking behavior, malaria prevention practices, and perceptions of government malaria control efforts. The survey was taken by in-person interview of all subjects. Most (97%) subjects were aware of malaria and more than two-thirds correctly identified mosquitoes as the vector. Forty-one percent of households in both forest/hilly and agricultural/urban areas reported malaria illness in the past year. Thirty-six percent (357 households) owned at least one bed net, 92% of these had been purchased by the owners. However, only 36% of households with bed nets affirmed their use as a means of preventing malaria. Nearly all respondents reported a willingness to accept spraying of residual insecticides for malaria prevention, yet less than 5% were willing to pay a nominal fee (US $3) for this service. Fifty-two percent of respondents reported self-treatment of malaria illness without visiting a health facility. This assessment of knowledge, attitudes, and practices showed a broad awareness of malaria and its consequences among residents of malarial areas in the Menoreh Hills of Central Java.

AB  - BASAK AC & BASAK SR. 2011. Biological control of Fusarium solani sp. dalbergiae, the wilt pathogen of Dalbergia sissoo, by Trichoderma viride and T. harzianum. The fungus Fusarium solani sp. dalbergiae was isolated from infected trees of Dalbergia sissoo. Several efforts of controlling the disease including biological means, both in vitro and in vivo, were tried. It was concluded that the fungus had been successfully destroyed by the two antagonists, Trichoderma viride and T. harzianum. Microscopic studies demonstrated mycoparasitism at different stages of hyphal interaction between the antagonists and the tested fungus. A distinct line of demarcation was produced between them in Petri dishes. In the in vivo tests, seven-month-old seedlings were placed in plastic pots containing soils inoculated with the pathogenic culture. Positive results were obtained in healing the seedlings in the fields. The efficacy of T. viride was superior to T. harzianum.

TI  - Application of targeted enrichment to next-generation sequencing of retroviruses integrated into the host human genome
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - The recent development and advancement of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have enabled the characterization of the human genome at extremely high resolution. In the retrovirology field, NGS technologies have been applied to integration-site analysis and deep sequencing of viral genomes in combination with PCR amplification using virus-specific primers. However, virus-specific primers are not available for some epigenetic analyses, like chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) assays. Viral sequences are poorly detected without specific PCR amplification because proviral DNA is very scarce compared to human genomic DNA. Here, we have developed and evaluated the use of biotinylated DNA probes for the capture of viral genetic fragments from a library prepared for NGS. Our results demonstrated that viral sequence detection was hundreds or thousands of times more sensitive after enrichment, enabling us to reduce the economic burden that arises when attempting to analyze the epigenetic landscape of proviruses by NGS. In addition, the method is versatile enough to analyze proviruses that have mismatches compared to the DNA probes. Taken together, we propose that this approach is a powerful tool to clarify the mechanisms of transcriptional and epigenetic regulation of retroviral proviruses that have, until now, remained elusive.

TI  - Investigation of a Sudden Malaria Outbreak in the Isolated Amazonian Village of Saul, French Guiana, January-April 2009
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Malaria is endemic in French Guiana. Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax are the predominant species responsible and Anopheles darlingi is described as the major vector. In mid-August 2008, an increase in malaria incidence was observed in Saul. A retrospective cohort survey was performed. In vitro susceptibility profiles to anti-malarials were determined on P. falciparum isolates. Collections of mosquitoes were organized. The malaria attack rate reached 70.6/100. The risk of malaria increased for people between 40 and 49 years of age, living in a house not subjected to a recent indoor residual insecticide spraying or staying overnight in the surrounding forest. All isolates were susceptible. Anopheles darlingi females and larvae were collected in the village suggesting a local transmission. Our results strongly support a role of illegal mining activities in the emergence of new foci of malaria. Therefore, public health authorities should define policies to fight malaria at a transborder level.

TI  - Organochlorine Pesticide Residues in Caudal Scutes of Belize Morelet's Crocodiles (<i>Crocodylus moreletii</i>)
T2  - JOURNAL OF HERPETOLOGY
AB  - Historically, Belize has used large quantities of organochlorine (OC) pesticides for agriculture and disease-vector control, yet few tools exist for noninvasive assessment of OC contaminant loads in Belize wildlife. Crocodile caudal (tail) scutes are clipped as a marking technique in wildlife management programs and may also have utility as a minimally invasive, nonlethal technique to assess contaminant burden. We collected caudal scutes from 96 Morelet's Crocodiles in Belize over 2 yr to analyze scute tissues for OCs and to compare the observed OC concentrations among different scute tissue (fat, cartilage, and muscle) and among crocodiles of different age classes, sexes, and collection locations. Organochlorines of the DDT-type subclass were detected in 72 of 96 crocodiles, with methoxychlor detected in all 72 scutes containing OCs and p,p-DDE, p,p'-DDT, and p,p-DDD detected in 54, 47, and 20 scute samples, respectively. Organochlorines were more-frequently detected in scutes of adult crocodiles, but methoxychlor was occasionally observed in juveniles at concentrations two orders of magnitude higher than observed in adults, suggesting maternal offload of methoxychlor to offspring, greater exposure through juvenile habitat and diet, or both. Organochlorines were detected in crocodiles from all sampling locations with more frequent and higher concentrations observed in crocodiles from lagoon habitats than from river habitats. This study demonstrates that scutes can be used as a nonlethal indicator of OCs present in Morelet's Crocodiles, a finding which has applications for determining the trophic transfer of OC pesticides through tropical aquatic food webs and for estimating the continuing risk posed to crocodiles and other species by OC pesticides.

TI  - Promiscuous arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis of yam (Dioscorea spp.), a key staple crop in West Africa
T2  - MYCORRHIZA
AB  - Yam (Dioscorea spp.) is a tuberous staple food crop of major importance in the sub-Saharan savannas of West Africa. Optimal yields commonly are obtained only in the first year following slash-and-burn in the shifting cultivation systems. It appears that the yield decline in subsequent years is not merely caused by soil nutrient depletion but might be due to a loss of the beneficial soil microflora, including arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), associated with tropical "tree-aspect" savannas and dry forests that are the natural habitats of the wild relatives of yam. Our objective was to study the AMF communities of natural savannas and adjacent yam fields in the Southern Guinea savanna of Benin. AMF were identified by morphotyping spores in the soil from the field sites and in AMF trap cultures with Sorghum bicolor and yam (Dioscorea rotundata and Dioscorea cayenensis) as bait plants. AMF species richness was higher in the savanna than in the yam-field soils (18-25 vs. 11-16 spp.), but similar for both ecosystems (29-36 spp.) according to the observations in trap cultures. Inoculation of trap cultures with soil sampled during the dry season led to high AMF root colonization, spore production, and species richness (overall 45 spp.) whereas inoculation with wet-season soil was inefficient (two spp. only). The use of D. cayenensis and D. rotundata as baits yielded 28 and 29 AMF species, respectively, and S. bicolor 37 species. AMF root colonization, however, was higher in yam than in sorghum (70-95 vs. 11-20%). After 8 months of trap culturing, the mycorrhizal yam had a higher tuber biomass than the nonmycorrhizal controls. The AMF actually colonizing D. rotundata roots in the field were also studied using a novel field sampling procedure for molecular analyses. Multiple phylotaxa were detected that corresponded with the spore morphotypes observed. It is, therefore, likely that the legacy of indigenous AMF from the natural savanna plays a crucial role for yam productivity, particularly in the low-input traditional farming systems prevailing in West Africa.

TI  - An alternative approach to detect <i>Trypanosoma</i> in <i>Glossina</i> (Diptera, Glossinidae) without dissection
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTION IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
AB  - Background: Determining if a tsetse fly is infected by trypanosomes and thus potentially able to transmit trypanosome-related human and animal diseases is an extremely laborious and time-consuming task to perform, especially under field conditions. In this study we tested a possible alternative approach that uses the entire insect vector for DNA extraction and PCR analysis to detect and identify Trypanosoma spp. in field collected tsetse flies.
   Methodology: DNA extraction was performed using a method originally developed for tick DNA extraction followed by PCR detection and identification of Trypanosoma spp.
   Results: Two out of 62 flies captured in Equatorial Guinea carried DNA of T. brucei s.l. and Trypanosoma vivax. T. congolense forest, T. congolense savannah and T. congolense Kilifi were not detected.
   Conclusions: The approach we employed allowed the molecular detection and species identification of trypanosomes using the whole vector body for DNA extraction. Although the approach does not give direct information on tsetse infectivity, it provides valuable information about trypanosome species circulating in a tsetse fly vector population. The method allows an effective processing of a large number of field captured tsetse in a central laboratory.

TI  - Insecticide and Repellent Mixture Pour-On Protects Cattle against Animal Trypanosomosis
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   African animal trypanosomosis (AAT), transmitted by tsetse flies and tick-borne diseases are the main constraints to livestock production in sub-Saharan Africa. Vector control methods such as pour-on offer individual protection against ticks but not against tsetse so far, for which protection has always been communal, through a reduction of their density. The latter requires the treatment of a large part of the herd in a given landscape and is not instantaneous.
   Methodology/Principal Findings
   Two prospective surveys were conducted to evaluate the efficacy and persistence of a pour-on formulation composed of cypermetrhin, chlorpyrifos, piperonyl butoxid and citronella (Vectoclor, CEVA Sante A Animal). In experimental conditions, tsetse flies were exposed to treated and control cattle. Flies knockdown and engorgement rates were determined and the product persistence was assessed as the time for these parameters to drop below 50% (T50). T50 was 37 days (95% CI: [33-41] days) and 46 days (95% CI: [39-56] days) for the knockdown and engorgement rates respectively. In field conditions, two cattle herds were monitored following a case-control experimental design, in the Adamaoua region of Cameroon. One herd was treated once with Vectoclor pour-on (treated group) and the second used as a control group (not treated). Ticks infestation rate, trypanosomosis prevalence and packed-cell volume were measured over the two months following treatment. The treatment was highly effective against ticks with a complete elimination three days after application in the treated group. Trypanosomosis prevalence was also significantly reduced during the study (by 4, P<0.001) and PCV of the treated group increased significantly in the same time (P<0.001), contrary to the control group.
   Conclusions/Significance
   The protection of this new pour-on against tsetse bites and trypanosomosis is demonstrated here for the first time. Moreover, this insecticide and repellent mixture offer a longer persistence of the efficacy against both tsetse and ticks than similar products currently on the market. It offers a great new opportunity for an integrated AAT control strategy including the treatment of residual cases with trypanocides. It might also allow controlling the spread of resistance against these trypanocides.

TI  - MEASUREMENT OF RISK IN ENDEMIC AREAS OF HUMAN AFRICAN TRYPANOSOMIASIS IN COTE-DIVOIRE
T2  - TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - An index of epidemiological risk was developed for the foci of human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) in the forest zone of Cote d'Ivoire, based on the following characteristics of Glossina palpalis palpalis populations: daily survival rate, apparent density of teneral males and females, and frequency of human-fly contact. The index agreed well with HAT prevalence. It varied according to ethnic groups and with seasonal changes in agricultural activities and fell rapidly to zero following the start of an anti-vector control campaign. Further studies in different biogeographical zones are desirable in order to substantiate the validity of the index.

TI  - CHARACTERIZATION OF THE LARVAL BREEDING SITES OF <i>ANOPHELES BALABACENSIS</i> (BAISAS), IN KUDAT, SABAH, MALAYSIA
T2  - SOUTHEAST ASIAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - The Malaysian government has a goal of eliminating malaria by 2020 but the increase in the number of cases of Plasmodium knowlesi presents a major challenge to this goal. Understanding the biology and breeding sites of vector mosquitoes is important to eliminating this disease. Therefore, we aimed to identify the larval breeding sites of Anopheles balabacensis in Kudat, Sabah, Malaysia, examine and define the environmental characteristics of its habitat and determine the association between these environmental characteristics and the biology of An. balabacensis. This study was carried out in the nine villages of Kudat. An. balabacensis breeding sites were identified. An. balabacensis preferred to breed in muddy ground pools and tire tracks formed in plantations and along the forest fringe. The most common breeding site had a surface area < 1 m(2), a depth of 5-10 cm, was in partly shaded area and located approximately 100 m from the nearest house. The breeding sites for An. balabacensis were near human settlements and work places, making this mosquito as potential vector for malaria in Kudat. The studied environment characteristics did not significantly influence the abundance of An. balabacensis. Our findings suggest comprehensive coverage of breeding sites is necessary for larval control and reduction of malaria transmission.

TI  - Oscillation, synchrony, and multi-factor patterns between cereal aphids and parasitoid populations in southern Brazil
T2  - BULLETIN OF ENTOMOLOGICAL RESEARCH
AB  - In different parts of the world, aphid populations and their natural enemies are influenced by landscapes and climate. In the Neotropical region, few long-term studies have been conducted, maintaining a gap for comprehension of the effect of meteorological variables on aphid population patterns and their parasitoids in field conditions. This study describes the general patterns of oscillation in cereal winged aphids and their parasitoids, selecting meteorological variables and evaluating their effects on these insects. Aphids exhibit two annual peaks, one in summer-fall transition and the other in winter-spring transition. For parasitoids, the highest annual peak takes place during winter and a second peak occurs in winter-spring transition. Temperature was the principal meteorological regulator of population fluctuation in winged aphids and parasitoids during the year. The favorable temperature range is not the same for aphids and parasitoids. For aphids, temperature increase resulted in population growth, with maximum positive effect at 25 degrees C. Temperature also positively influenced parasitoid populations, but the growth was asymptotic around 20 degrees C. Although rainfall showed no regulatory function on aphid seasonality, it influenced the final number of insects over the year. The response of aphids and parasitoids to temperature has implications for trophic compatibility and regulation of their populations. Such functions should be taken into account in predictive models.

TI  - An attenuated replication-competent chikungunya virus with a fluorescently tagged envelope
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is the most common alphavirus infecting humans worldwide, causing acute and chronically debilitating arthralgia at a great economic expense.
   Methodology/Principal findings
   To facilitate our study of CHIKV, we generated a mCherry tagged replication-competent chimeric virus, CHIKV 37997-mCherry. Single particle cryoEM demonstrated icosahedral organization of the chimeric virus and the display of mCherry proteins on virus surface. CHIKV 37997-mCherry is attenuated in both IFN alpha R knockout and wild-type mice. Strong antiCHIKV and anti-mCherry antibody responses were induced in CHIKV 37997-mCherry infected mice.
   Conclusions/Significance
   Our work suggests that chimeric alphaviruses displaying foreign antigen can serve as vaccines against both aphaviruses and other pathogens and diseases.

TI  - Cytotoxic activity of <i>Androctonus australis hector</i> venom and its toxic fractions on human lung cancer cell line
T2  - JOURNAL OF VENOMOUS ANIMALS AND TOXINS INCLUDING TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background: Several studies have showed that animal venoms are a source of bioactive compounds that may inhibit the growth of cancer cells, which makes them useful agents for therapeutic applications. Recently, it was established that venom toxins from scorpions induced cytotoxic, antiproliferative and apoptogenic effects on cancer cells. Therefore, the present study aims to investigate the cytotoxic activity of Androctonus australis hector (Aah) scorpion venom and its toxic fractions (FtoxG-50 and F3) on NCI-H358 human lung cancer cells.
   Methods: The cytotoxic and antiproliferative activities were estimated using MTT assay, lactate dehydrogenase release and clonogenic assays. Apoptosis was evaluated by Hoechst 33258 staining, DNA fragmentation assay and caspase-3 activity. Oxidative stress was analyzed by reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide, malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl levels along with assessment of antioxidant status. In addition, alteration of mitochondrial membrane potential was analyzed by JC1 fluorescent dye.
   Results: The present findings showed that F3 fraction was more cytotoxic towards NCI-H358 lung cancer cells with an IC50 of 27.05 +/- 0.70 mu g/mL than venom alone (396.60 +/- 1.33 mu g/mL) and its toxic fraction FtoxG-50 (45.86 +/- 0.91 mu g/mL). Nevertheless, F3 fraction was not cytotoxic at these concentrations on normal human lung fibroblast MRC-5 cells. Inhibition of NCI-H358 cell proliferation after F3 fraction exposure occurred mainly by apoptosis as evidenced by damaged nuclei, significant DNA fragmentation level and caspase-3 activation in a dose dependent manner. Moreover, F3 fraction enhanced oxidative and nitrosative stress biomarkers and dissipated mitochondrial membrane potential in lung cancer cells along with significant depletion in cellular enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants. Further, the apoptosis induced by F3 fraction was markedly prevented by the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) suggesting the potential mechanism of oxidative stress.
   Conclusion: These findings suggest that F3 fraction could induce apoptosis in lung cancer cells through involvement of oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Hence, these properties make F3 fraction a promising candidate for development of new anticancer agents.

A1  - Cochrane COVID-19 Diagnost Test Ac
TI  - Thoracic imaging tests for the diagnosis of COVID-19
T2  - COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS
AB  - Background
   The respiratory illness caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection continues to present diagnostic challenges. Early research showed thoracic (chest) imaging to be sensitive but not specific in the diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, this is a rapidly developing field and these findings need to be re-evaluated in the light of new research. This is the first update of this 'living systematic review'. This update focuses on people suspected of having COVID-19 and excludes studies with only confirmed COVID-19 participants.
   Objectives
   To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of thoracic imaging (computed tomography (CT), X-ray and ultrasound) in people with suspected COVID-19.
   Search methods
   We searched the COVID-19 Living Evidence Database from the University of Bern, the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, The Stephen B. Thacker CDC Library, and repositories of COVID-19 publications through to 22 June 2020. We did not apply any language restrictions.
   Selection criteria
   We included studies of all designs that recruited participants of any age group suspected to have COVID-19, and which reported estimates of test accuracy, or provided data from which estimates could be computed. When studies used a variety of reference standards, we retained the classification of participants as COVID-19 positive or negative as used in the study.
   Data collection and analysis
   We screened studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias and applicability concerns using the QUADAS-2 domain-list independently, in duplicate. We categorised included studies into three groups based on classification of index test results: studies that reported specific criteria for index test positivity (group 1); studies that did not report specific criteria, but had the test reader(s) explicitly classify the imaging test result as either COVID-19 positive or negative (group 2); and studies that reported an overview of index test findings, without explicitly classifying the imaging test as either COVID-19 positive or negative (group 3). We presented the results of estimated sensitivity and specificity using paired forest plots, and summarised in tables. We used a bivariate meta-analysis model where appropriate. We presented uncertainty of the accuracy estimates using 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
   Main results
   We included 34 studies: 30 were cross-sectional studies with 8491 participants suspected of COVID-19, of which 4575 (54%) had a final diagnosis of COVID-19; four were case-control studies with 848 cases and controls in total, of which 464 (55%) had a final diagnosis of COVID-19. Chest CT was evaluated in 31 studies (8014 participants, 4224 (53%) cases), chest X-ray in three studies (1243 participants, 784 (63%) cases), and ultrasound of the lungs in one study (100 participants, 31 (31%) cases).
   Twenty-six per cent (9/34) of all studies were available only as preprints. Nineteen studies were conducted in Asia, 10 in Europe, four in North America and one in Australia. Sixteen studies included only adults, 15 studies included both adults and children and one included only children. Two studies did not report the ages of participants. Twenty-four studies included inpatients, four studies included outpatients, while the remaining six studies were conducted in unclear settings. The majority of included studies had a high or unclear risk of bias with respect to participant selection, index test, reference standard, and participant flow.
   For chest CT in suspected COVID-19 participants (31 studies, 8014 participants, 4224 (53%) cases) the sensitivity ranged from 57.4% to 100%, and specificity ranged from 0% to 96.0%. The pooled sensitivity of chest CT in suspected COVID-19 participants was 89.9% (95% CI 85.7 to 92.9) and the pooled specificity was 61.1% (95% CI 42.3 to 77.1). Sensitivity analyses showed that when the studies from China were excluded, the studies from other countries demonstrated higher specificity compared to the overall included studies. When studies that did not classify index tests as positive or negative for COVID-19 (group 3) were excluded, the remaining studies (groups 1 and 2) demonstrated higher specificity compared to the overall included studies.
   Sensitivity analyses limited to cross-sectional studies, or studies where at least two reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) tests were conducted if the first was negative, did not substantively alter the accuracy estimates. We did not identify publication status as a source of heterogeneity.
   For chest X-ray in suspected COVID-19 participants (3 studies, 1243 participants, 784 (63%) cases) the sensitivity ranged from 56.9% to 89.0% and specificity from 11.1% to 88.9%. The sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound of the lungs in suspected COVID-19 participants (1 study, 100 participants, 31 (31%) cases) were 96.8% and 62.3%, respectively. We could not perform a meta-analysis for chest X-ray or ultrasound due to the limited number of included studies.
   Authors' conclusions
   Our findings indicate that chest CT is sensitive and moderately specific for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in suspected patients, meaning that CT may have limited capability in diQerentiating SARS-CoV-2 infection from other causes of respiratory illness. However, we are limited in our confidence in these results due to the poor study quality and the heterogeneity of included studies. Because of limited data, accuracy estimates of chest X-ray and ultrasound of the lungs for the diagnosis of suspected COVID-19 cases should be carefully interpreted.
   Future diagnostic accuracy studies should pre-define positive imaging findings, include direct comparisons of the various modalities of interest on the same participant population, and implement improved reporting practices. Planned updates of this review will aim to: increase precision around the accuracy estimates for chest CT (ideally with low risk of bias studies); obtain further data to inform accuracy of chest X-rays and ultrasound; and obtain data to further fulfil secondary objectives (e.g. `threshold' eQects, comparing accuracy estimates across diQerent imaging modalities) to inform the utility of imaging along diQerent diagnostic pathways.

TI  - Selective Cytotoxicity of Some Plant Extracts Against Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cells but Not Mesenchymal Stem Cells: A Pilot Screening
T2  - CANCER BIOLOGY AND ADVANCES IN TREATMENT
CP  - 3rd International Conference on Innovations in Cancer Research and Regenerative Medicine
AB  - Introduction Medicinal plants have been used for disease treatment throughout history, especially in Asia. Vietnam is a tropical country which possesses forests with a diversity of plants; among the plants, many have been historically used as alternative therapies for various disease treatments. In this study we aimed to evaluate the selective cytotoxicity of some plant extracts (collected from Vietnamese forests) against hepatocellular carcinoma cells HepG2, compared to adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs).
   Methods In this study, we collected nine plants and produced nine extracts from them; these included whole stem of Buchanania lucida, whole stem of Dipterocarpus turbinatus, Hopea recopei, whole stem of Shorea thorelii, bark of Shorea thorelii stem, bark of Dipterocarpus turbinatus stem, whole stem of Dipterocarpus costatus, bark of Dipterocarpus costatus stem, and rhizome of Boesenbergia pandurata. The cytotoxicity of these extracts on hepatocellular carcinoma cells and mesenchymal stem cells were determined based on IC50 values calculated using Alamar Blue assay. Based on these IC50 values, the side effect index (SEI) of extracts was determined. Only the extracts with low SEI were used in further assays to determine the apoptotic status of both hepatocellular carcinoma cells and mesenchymal stem cells via caspase 3/7 induction assay, nuclei disintegration (using Hoechst 33342 staining), and Annexin V staining assay.
   Results The results showed that B. pandurata extract had strong cytotoxicity toward HepG2 cells with lowest side index on mesenchymal stem cells (IC50 on HepG2 of 222 +/- 27.82 (mu g/ml) but IC50 on ADSCs of 382 +/- 16.19 (mu g/ml)). Nuclear staining showed that B. pandurata extract could induce disintegration of cell nuclei at the concentration of 400 mu g/ml. After 3 h of incubation with B. pandurata extract at the concentration of 200 mu g/ml, the BP extract induced caspase 3/7 activation in HepG2 cells, but not in mesenchymal stem cells. Annexin V staining showed that the BP extract induced apoptosis in HepG2 cells in a dose-dependent manner.
   Conclusion This study revealed that selective cytotoxicity of some extracts on cancer cells could be determined based on their IC50 values on cancer cells and on mesenchymal stem cells. B. pandurata extract displayed the lowest side effect index on mesenchymal stem cells and successfully induced apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma cells HepG2 via activation of caspase 3/7.

TI  - State of Artemisinin and Partner Drug Susceptibility in <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> Clinical Isolates
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Delayed parasite clearance time observed in Southeast Asia provided the first evidence of Plasmodium falciparum resistance to artemisinins. The ex vivo ring-stage survival assay (RSA) mimics parasite exposure to pharmacologically relevant artemisinin concentrations. Mutations in the C-terminal propeller domain of the putative kelch protein Pf3D7_1343700 (K13) are associated with artemisinin resistance. Variations in the pfmdr1 gene are associated with reduced susceptibility to the artemisinin partner drugs mefloquine (MQ) and lumefantrine (LF). To clarify the unknown landscape of artemisinin resistance in Colombia, 71 patients with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria were enrolled in a non-randomized observational study in three endemic localities in 2014-2015. Each patient's parasite isolate was assessed for ex vivo RSA, K13-propeller mutations, pfmdr1 copy number, and pfmdr1 mutations at codons 86,184,1034, 1042, and 1246, associated with reduced susceptibility, and 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) for other antimalarial drugs. Ex vivo RSAs were successful in 56% (40/71) of samples, and nine isolates showed survival rates > 1%. All isolates had wild-type K13-propeller sequences. All isolates harbored either of two pfmdr1 haplotypes, NFSDD (79.3%) and NFSDY (20.7%), and 7.1% of isolates had > 1 pfmdr1 gene. In vitro IC50 assays showed that variable proportions of isolates had decreased susceptibility to chloroquine (52.4%, > 100 nM), amodiaquine (31.2%, > 30 nM), MQ (34.3%, > 30 nM), and LF (3.2%, > 10 nM). In this study, we report ex vivo RSA and K13 data on P. falciparum isolates from Colombia. The identification of isolates with increased ex vivo RSA rates in the absence of K13-propeller mutations and no positivity at day three requires further investigation.

TI  - Adapting Strategies for Effective Schistosomiasis Prevention: A Mathematical Modeling Approach
T2  - MATHEMATICS
AB  - One of the most deadly neglected tropical diseases known to man is schistosomiasis. Understanding how the disease spreads and evaluating the relevant control strategies are key steps in predicting its spread. We propose a mathematical model to evaluate the potential impact of four strategies: chemotherapy, awareness programs, the mechanical removal of snails and molluscicides, and the impact of a change in temperature on different molluscicide performances based on their half-lives and the length of time they persist in contact with target species. The results show that the recruitment rate of humans and the presence of cercaria and miracidia parasites are crucial factors in disease transmission. However, schistosomiasis can be entirely eradicated by combining all of the four strategies. In the face of climate change and molluscicide degradation, the results show that increasing the temperatures and the number of days a molluscicide persists in the environment before it completely degrades decreases the chemically induced mortality rate of snails while increasing the half-life of different molluscicides increases the death rate of snails. Therefore, eradicating schistosomiasis effectively necessitates a comprehensive integration of all preventative measures. Moreover, regions with different weather patterns and seasonal climates need strategies that have been adapted in terms of the appropriate molluscicide and time intervals for reapplication and effective schistosomiasis control.

   Materials and methods: All relevant worldwide accepted databases were searched for the terms "Clerodendrum", "Clerodendrum serratum", "Bharangi" and "Cheruthekku" along with the other literature from Indian classical texts and pharmacopoeias. There was no specific timeline set for the search. The accessible literatures available on C serratum were collected via electronic search using Pubmed, Scopus, Science Direct and traditional books reports on ethnopharmacology and traditional medicines.
   Results: C serratum has played an important role in Indian system of medicine. In addition to the common local use in respiratory diseases, other ethnomedicinal uses include treatment of pain, inflammation, rheumatism and fever especially malarial fever. Scientific studies on extracts and formulations revealed anti-asthmatic, mast cell stabilization and anti-allergic effects of roots of C serratum. Reported data on pharmacological activities also includes hepatoprotective, anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anticancer potential of the drug. Saponins (terpenoids and steroids), flavonoids and phenolics isolated from roots have been the focus of phytochemical investigations as the biological activity has been ascribed to the saponins, which are known to possess anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer activity. Isolated bioactives from roots like icosahydropicenic acid and ursolic acid have been claimed to offer anti-allergic and hepatoprotective activity.
   Conclusions: Therapeutic potential of roots and leaves of C serratum has been demonstrated in the conditions like asthma, allergy, fever, inflammation and liver disorders attributed to the presence of various flavonoids, phenolics and saponins present in the drug. Many ethnobotanical claims have been confirmed through modern in-vitro and in-vivo pharmacological studies of different extracts and isolates from plant; however, additional studies on the biomarkers are needed to establish mechanism of action and to validate the traditional use of this drug in clinical practices after proper safety assessment.

TI  - Role of body size in activity budgets of mammals in the Western Ghats of India
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY
AB  - Body size in animals is an important trait affecting species niche differentiation and restricting similarity. Using camera-trap data over 2008-2010, we used photo-captures from 50 cameras spread throughout Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (Western Ghats, India) to assess the activity budgets of 21 mammal species ranging in body size from 1 kg to 2088 kg. Large carnivores were mostly cathemeral whereas small cat and civet species were purely nocturnal. Mongoose species were mainly diurnal possibly due to their terrestrial feeding habits and reduce competition with other sympatric small carnivores. All large and small-bodied herbivores were cathemeral and nocturnal respectively, whereas medium-sized herbivores were active during the day. Overall, small mammals tended to be mostly nocturnal, whereas large mammals were cathemeral mainly due to energy requirements and other ecological constraints. Body size showed significant negative relationship with mean vector length (clustering of activity in time) thus implying that the daily amount of time being active increased with body size. The shorter activity time (12 h) in small mammals resulted in higher mean vector length probably to utilize the available time to fulfil energy needs. The observed cathemeral activity in large mammals may be associated with travel over larger areas to acquire large quantities of food therefore they are active for a longer duration. Our results clearly support the allometric relationship between body size and activity budgets in mammals and its association with niche differentiation.

TI  - The role of soil communities on the germination of a pioneer tree species in the Atlantic rainforest
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Climate change has been modifying precipitation and temperature in many regions of the world, prompting changes in plant communities. It also affects soil microbial communities, indirectly influencing plant species distribution through plant-soil feedbacks. Here we report an experiment designed to test seed germination responses to global change, addressed through the interaction between increased temperature and soil microbial communities in a tree species in the Atlantic rainforest, a global biodiversity hotspot. Our objective was to test plant-soil feedbacks in an early colonizer tree species, Schizolobium parahyba, and their interaction with warming. We assessed the role of increased air temperature and soil microbiota in controlling seed germination as a function of distance to mother tree. Higher germination percentages were recorded with extracts of soil microbial communities from the edge of the canopy than with microbial extracts obtained closer to the trunk. These manipulations evidenced that soil microbiota influenced seed germination, being responsible for Janzen-Connell effects. Warming produced major changes in microbial composition but the effect on germination was unclear. Our results may help understand species distribution and coexistence in secondary patches of Atlantic rainforest under warmer conditions, and may contribute to the design of successful restoration programs.

TI  - A <i>Mycobacterium ulcerans</i> toxin, mycolactone, causes apoptosis in guinea pig ulcers and tissue culture cells
T2  - INFECTION AND IMMUNITY
AB  - Mycobacterium ulcerans is the causative agent of Buruli ulcer, a tropical ulcerative skin disease. One of the most intriguing aspects of this disease is the presence of extensive tissue damage in the absence of an acute inflammatory response. We recently purified and characterized a macrolide toxin, mycolactone, from M. ulcerans. Injection of this molecule into guinea pig skin reproduced cell death and lack of acute inflammatory response similar to that seen following the injection of viable bacteria. We also showed that mycolactone causes a cytopathic effect on mouse fibroblast L929 cells that is characterized by cytoskeletal rearrangements and growth arrest within 48 h. However, these results could not account for the extensive cell death which occurs in Buruli ulcer. The results presented here demonstrate that L929 and J774 mouse macrophage cells die via apoptosis after 3 to 5 days of exposure to mycolactone. Treatment of cells with a pan-caspase inhibitor can inhibit mycolactone-induced apoptosis, We demonstrate that injection of mycolactone into guinea pig skin results in cell death via apoptosis and that the extent of apoptosis increases as the lesion progresses, These results may help to explain why tissue damage in Buruli ulcer is not accompanied by an acute inflammatory response.

T2  - ANNALS OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND PARASITOLOGY
AB  - Examination of chromatograms of karyotyped larvae of Anopheles gambiae s.s. and Anopheles arabiensis has revealed that there are differences in the profile of their epicuticular hydrocarbons. A discriminant analysis of the quantitative hydrocarbon data has shown that the An. gambiae Mopti 2Rbc/bc karyotype from Mali could be separated from the Forest 2La/a karyotype from Liberia in >80% of cases. Similar analysis permitted >80% separation of individuals of two karyotypes of Anopheles arabiensis: 2Rab/+ from Burkina Faso, and 2Rb/b from Madagascar.

TI  - Environmental risk modelling and potential sand fly vectors of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Chitral district: a leishmanial focal point of mount Tirich Mir, Pakistan
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE & INTERNATIONAL HEALTH
AB  - ObjectiveTo provide baseline information about suspected vectors and the incidence, distribution and an active zone of transmission for cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) in Chitral, Pakistan, using GIS tools; and to investigate the role of environmental factors in the disease dynamics.
   MethodTwo surveys in 2014 and 2016 as a basis for choropleth and environmental risk mapping.
   ResultsA total of 769 captured specimens yielded 14 Phlebotomus and six Sergentomyia species including two potential vectors of CL, i.e. Phlebotomus papatasi and Phlebotomus sergenti. P. papatasi (71%) was dominant, followed by P. sergenti (18%). A choropleth map generated in Arcmap 10.1 based on 1560 CL case reports displayed maximum prevalence (0.92-2.5%) in Ayun, Broz, Charun, Chitral 1 and 2 and Darosh 1 and 2 union councils. An environmental risk map constructed by MaxEnt 3.3.3 defined an active zone of transmission based on leishmaniasis occurrence records (n = 315). The analysis of variable contribution in MaxEnt indicates significance of elevation (54.4%), population density (23.3%) and land use/land cover (6.6%) in CL disease dynamics.
   ConclusionThe probability of CL increases (0.6-1 on logistic scale) in severely deforested areas, in lowland valleys and in regions with high-population density.

TI  - GEOLOGIC EFFECTS OF HURRICANES
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
CP  - 25th Binghamton Symposium in Geomorphology
AB  - Hurricanes are intense low pressure systems of tropical origin.  Hurricane damage results from storm surge, wind, and inland flooding from heavy rainfall.  Field observations and remote sensing of recent major hurricanes such as Hugo (1989), Andrew (1992) and Iniki (1992) are providing new insights into the mechanisms producing damage in these major storms.  Velocities associated with hurricanes include the counterclockwise vortex winds flowing around the eye and the much slower regional winds that steer the hurricane and move it forward.  Vectorial addition of these two winds on the right side of the storm gives a higher effective wind speed than on the left side.  Coast-parallel hurricane tracks keep the weaker left side of the storm against the coast, whereas coast-normal tracks produce a wide swath of destruction as the more powerful right side of the storm cuts a swath of destruction hundreds of kilometers inland.  Storm surge is a function of the wind speed, central pressure, shelf slope, shoreline configuration, and anthropogenic alterations to the shoreline.  Maximum surge heights are not under the eye of the hurricane, where the pressure is lowest, but on the right side of the eye at the radius of maximum winds, where the winds are strongest.  Flood surge occurs as the hurricane approaches land and drives coastal waters, and superimposed waves, across the shore.  Ebb surge occurs when impounded surface water flows seaward as the storm moves inland.  Flood and ebb surge damage have been greatly increased in recent hurricanes as a result of anthropogenic changes along the shoreline.
   Hurricane wind damage occurs on three scales - megascale, mesoscale and microscale.  Local wind damage is a function of wind speed, exposure and structural resistance to velocity pressure, wind drag and flying debris.  Localized extreme damage is caused by gusts that can locally exceed sustained winds by a factor of two in areas where there is strong convective activity.
   Geologic changes occurring in hurricanes include beach erosion, dune erosion, inlet formation from flood and ebb surge, landscape changes through tree destruction by wind and nearshore channeling and sedimentation resulting from ebb surge.
   Multi-decadal wet and dry cycles in West Africa seem to be associated with increases (wet periods) and decreases (dry periods) in the frequency of Atlantic Coast landfalling hurricanes.  Coastal zone population and development has increased markedly in a time of low hurricane frequency in the 24 year dry cycle from 1970 to the present.  However, no previous climatic cycle in this century has exceeded 26 years.  We may be entering a multi-decadal cycle of greater hurricane activity, placing these highly urbanized shorelines in considerable danger.

TI  - Framing the detection of incipient tuberculosis infection: A qualitative study of political prioritisation
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE & INTERNATIONAL HEALTH
AB  - Objective Incipient Tuberculosis (ITB) refers to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection that is likely to progress to active disease in the absence of treatment, but without clinical signs, symptoms, radiographic or microbiological evidence of disease. Biomarker-based tests to diagnose incipient TB hold promise for better prediction and, through TB preventive therapy, prevention of disease. This study explored current and future framing and prioritisation of ITB. Methods Twenty-two interviews across eight countries were conducted. A modified Shiffman & Smith Framework, containing four categories-Ideas, Issue Characteristics, Actor Power, and Political Contexts-was used to analyse the current landscape and potential for prioritisation of diagnosis and treatment of ITB. Results Latent TB policy implementation has been slow due to technical, logistical and financial challenges, and because it has been framed in a manner non-conducive to gaining political priority. Framing ITB testing as 'early detection' rather than 'prediction', and its management as 'treatment' rather than 'preventive therapy', may help raise its importance in policies, and its acceptance among actors. Conclusion Consensus surrounding the framing of ITB will be crucial for the successful adoption of ITB diagnostics and treatment. When designing ITB tools and policies, it will be important to address challenges that pertain to latent TB policies.

TI  - Stable high-density and maternally inherited Wolbachia infections in <i>Anopheles moucheti</i> and <i>Anopheles demeilloni</i> mosquitoes
T2  - CURRENT BIOLOGY
AB  - Wolbachia, a widespread bacterium that can reduce pathogen transmission in mosquitoes, has recently been reported to be present in Anopheles (An.) species. In wild populations of the An. gambiae complex, the primary vectors of Plasmodium malaria in Sub-Saharan Africa, Wolbachia DNA sequences at low density and infection frequencies have been detected. As the majority of studies have used highly sensitive nested PCR as the only method of detection, more robust evidence is required to determine whether Wolbachia strains are established as endosymbionts in Anopheles species. Here, we describe high-density Wolbachia infections in geographically diverse populations of An. moucheti and An. demeilloni. Fluorescent in situ hybridization localized a heavy infection in the ovaries of An. moucheti, and maternal transmission was observed. Genome sequencing of both Wolbachia strains obtained genome depths and coverages comparable to those of other known infections. Notably, homologs of cytoplasmic incompatibility factor (cif) genes were present, indicating that these strains possess the capacity to induce the cytoplasmic incompatibility phenotype, which allows Wolbachia to spread through host populations. These strains should be further investigated as candidates for use in Wolbachia biocontrol strategies in Anopheles aiming to reduce the transmission of malaria.

TI  - Duty Hours on Surgery Clerkship: From Compliance Nightmare to Leadership and Professional Development Opportunity
T2  - PHYTON-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY
AB  - The calla lily (Zantedeschia spreng.) is a bulbous flower native to the tropical regions of Africa. Calla lily has gained significant popularity in the international market owing to its intricate morphology and prolonged flowering duration. Despite such advantages, for two sub-groups of calla lily, known as group Zantedeschia and group Aestivae, there are challenges in terms of hybrid production due to the 'plastome-genome incompatibility' therebetween. Tissue culture is a fundamental biotechnological tool used in gene editing research, with a focus on disease resistance and flower color in calla lily breeding programs. The present review provides a brief background on the history and development of the calla lily, as well as a comprehensive and critical summary of calla lily tissue culture research. The regeneration pathways for both group Zantedeschia and group Aestivae can be divided into de novo organogenesis and somatic embryogenesis. Both groups are capable of obtaining replants through such means. However, only some species in group Aestivae have been reported to be successful in the somatic embryogenesis pathway. In the present review, special attention was paid to the influence of explant types, plant growth regulators, and culture conditions on both de novo organogenesis and somatic embryogenesis in calla lily tissue culture. Ultimately, future research prospects were determined based on integrated analysis of recent progress in calla lily tissue culture research.

TI  - Glycosylation of Erythrocyte Spectrin and Its Modification in Visceral Leishmaniasis
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Using a lectin, Achatinin-H, having preferential specificity for glycoproteins with terminal 9-O-acetyl sialic acid derivatives linked in alpha 2-6 linkages to subterminal N-acetylgalactosamine, eight distinct disease-associated 9-O-acetylated sialoglycoproteins was purified from erythrocytes of visceral leishmaniaisis (VL) patients (RBCVL). Analyses of tryptic fragments by mass spectrometry led to the identification of two high-molecular weight 9-O-acetylated sialoglycoproteins as human erythrocytic alpha- and beta-spectrin. Total spectrin purified from erythrocytes of VL patients (spectrin(VL)) was reactive with Achatinin-H. Interestingly, along with two high molecular weight bands corresponding to alpha- and beta-spectrin another low molecular weight 60 kDa band was observed. Total spectrin was also purified from normal human erythrocytes (spectrin(N)) and insignificant binding with Achatinin-H was demonstrated. Additionally, this 60 kDa fragment was totally absent in spectrin(N). Although the presence of both N- and O-glycosylations was found both in spectrin(N) and spectrin(VL), enhanced sialylation was predominantly induced in spectrin(VL). Sialic acids accounted for approximately 1.25 kDa mass of the 60 kDa polypeptide. The demonstration of a few identified sialylated tryptic fragments of alpha- and beta-spectrin(VL) confirmed the presence of terminal sialic acids. Molecular modelling studies of spectrin suggest that a sugar moiety can fit into the potential glycosylation sites. Interestingly, highly sialylated spectrin(VL) showed decreased binding with spectrin-depleted inside-out membrane vesicles of normal erythrocytes compared to spectrin(N) suggesting functional abnormality. Taken together this is the first report of glycosylated eythrocytic spectrin in normal erythrocytes and its enhanced sialylation in RBCVL. The enhanced sialylation of this cytoskeleton protein is possibly related to the fragmentation of spectrin(VL) as evidenced by the presence of an additional 60 kDa fragment, absent in spectrin(N) which possibly affects the biology of RBCVL linked to both severe distortion of erythrocyte development and impairment of erythrocyte membrane integrity and may provide an explanation for their sensitivity to hemolysis and anemia in VL patients.

TI  - Predicting the impact of insecticide-treated bed nets on malaria transmission: the devil is in the detail
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
AB  - Background: Insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs), including long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs), play a primary role in global campaigns to roll back malaria in tropical Africa. Effectiveness of treated nets depends on direct impacts on individual mosquitoes including killing and excite-repellency, which vary considerably among vector species due to variations in host-seeking behaviours. While monitoring and evaluation programmes of ITNs have focuses on morbidity and all-cause mortality in humans, local entomological context receives little attention. Without knowing the dynamics of local vector species and their responses to treated nets, it is difficult to predict clinical outcomes when ITN applications are scaled up across African continent. Sound model frameworks incorporating intricate interactions between mosquitoes and treated nets are needed to develop the predictive capacity for scale-up applications of ITNs.
   Methods: An established agent-based model was extended to incorporate the direct outcomes, e. g. killing and avoidance, of individual mosquitoes exposing to ITNs in a hypothetical village setting with 50 houses and 90 aquatic habitats. Individual mosquitoes were tracked throughout the life cycle across the landscape. Four levels of coverage, i.e. 40, 60, 80 and 100%, were applied at the household level with treated houses having only one bed net. By using Latin hypercube sampling scheme, parameters governing killing, diverting and personal protection of net users were evaluated for their relative roles in containing mosquito populations, entomological inoculation rates (EIRs) and malaria incidence.
   Results: There were substantial gaps in coverage between households and individual persons, and 100% household coverage resulted in circa 50% coverage of the population. The results show that applications of ITNs could give rise to varying impacts on population-level metrics depending on values of parameters governing interactions of mosquitoes and treated nets at the individual level. The most significant factor in determining effectiveness was killing capability of treated nets. Strong excito-repellent effect of impregnated nets might lead to higher risk exposure to non-bed net users.
   Conclusion: With variabilities of vector mosquitoes in host-seeking behaviours and the responses to treated nets, it is anticipated that scale-up applications of INTs might produce varying degrees of success dependent on local entomological and epidemiological contexts. This study highlights that increased ITN coverage led to significant reduction in risk exposure and malaria incidence only when treated nets yielded high killing effects. It is necessary to test efficacy of treated nets on local dominant vector mosquitoes, at least in laboratory, for monitoring and evaluation of ITN programmes.

TI  - MALARIA TRENDS AND CHALLENGES IN THE GREATER MEKONG SUBREGION
T2  - SOUTHEAST ASIAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - This report provides an overview of the epidemiological patterns of malaria in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) from 1998 to 2007, and highlights critical challenges facing national malaria control programs and partners in effort to build on their Successes as they move towards malaria pre-elimination and elimination as a programmatic goal. Epidemiological data provided by malaria programs show a drastic decline in malaria deaths and confirmed malaria positive cases over the last 10 years in the GMS. More than half of confirmed malaria cases and deaths recorded in the GMS occur in Myanmar, however, reporting methods and data management are not comparable between countries despite effort made by WHO to harmonize data collection, analysis and reporting among WHO Member States. Malaria is concentrated in forested/forest-fringe areas of the region mainly along international borders providing strong rationale to develop harmonized cross-border pre-elimination programs in conjunction with national efforts. Across the Mekong Region, the declining efficacy of recommended first-line antimalarials, eg artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) against falciparum malaria on the Cambodia-Thailand border, the prevalence of counterfeit and substandard antimalarial drugs, the lack of health services in general and malaria services in particular in remote settings, and the lack of information and services targeting migrants and mobile population present important barriers to reach or maintain malaria pre-elimination programmatic goals. Strengthening networking between research institutions and non-government organizations will increase knowledge-based decision and action.

TI  - Transmission dynamics of co-endemic <i>Plasmodium vivax</i> and <i>P-falciparum</i> in Ethiopia and prevalence of antimalarial resistant genotypes
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Ethiopia is one of the few African countries where Plasmodium vivax is co-endemic with P. falciparum. Malaria transmission is seasonal and transmission intensity varies mainly by landscape and climate. Although the recent emergence of drug resistant parasites presents a major issue to malaria control in Ethiopia, little is known about the transmission pathways of parasite species and prevalence of resistant markers. This study used microsatellites to determine population diversity and gene flow patterns of P. falciparum (N = 226) and P. vivax (N = 205), as well as prevalence of drug resistant markers to infer the impact of gene flow and existing malaria treatment regimes. Plasmodium falciparum indicated a higher rate of polyclonal infections than P. vivax. Both species revealed moderate genetic diversity and similar population structure. Populations in the northern highlands were closely related to the eastern Rift Valley, but slightly distinct from the southern basin area. Gene flow via human migrations between the northern and eastern populations were frequent and mostly bidirectional. Landscape genetic analyses indicated that environmental heterogeneity and geographical distance did not constrain parasite gene flow. This may partly explain similar patterns of resistant marker prevalence. In P. falciparum, a high prevalence of mutant alleles was detected in codons related to chloroquine (pfcrt and pfmdr1) and sulfadoxine- pyrimethamine (pfdhps and pfdhfr) resistance. Over 60% of the samples showed pfmdr1 duplications. Nevertheless, no mutation was detected in pfK13 that relates to artemisinin resistance. In P. vivax, while sequences of pvcrt-o were highly conserved and less than 5% of the samples showed pvmdr duplications, over 50% of the samples had pvmdr1 976F mutation. It remains to be tested if this mutation relates to chloroquine resistance. Monitoring the extent of malaria spread and markers of drug resistance is imperative to inform policy for evidence-based antimalarial choice and interventions. To effectively reduce malaria burden in Ethiopia, control efforts should focus on seasonal migrant populations.

TI  - Impact of Malaria Diagnostic Technologies on the Disease Burden in the Sub-Saharan Africa
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE
AB  - Worldwide, transmission of emerging and reemerging malaria infections poses a significant threat to human health in the Sub-Saharan Africa, one that can quickly overwhelm public health resources. While the disease burden of malaria in the Sub-Saharan Africa appears to be on a gradual decline, it is characterized by spatial and temporal variability occasioning a sorry state for the Global South Countries. New evidence on long-term complications of malaria heightens our awareness of its public health impact. Given the likelihood of misdiagnosis, and the unknown levels of malaria transmission across different landscapes, many missed opportunities for prevention occur. Africa's population growth, unplanned urbanization, habitat destruction, and trans-border travel are contributing to a rise in the calamitous epidemiology of malaria. Despite empirical statistics demonstrating a downward trend in the malaria disease burden attributable to the scale-up of multiple control strategies, including new diagnostic technologies, malaria remains a global threat to human health in Sub-Sahara Africa. Malaria is a severe public health threat globally, despite several advancements and innovations in its control. Six species of the genus Plasmodium including Plasmodium malariae, Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium cynomolgi, Plasmodium knowlesi, Plasmodium ovale, and Plasmodium vivax are known to infect humans. However, greatest disease burden and fatalities are caused by Plasmodium falciparum. Globally, about 3 billion individuals are at risk of contracting malaria disease every year, with over 400,000 fatalities reported in the Sub-Saharan Africa. World Health Organization (WHO) 2018 malaria report indicated that approximately 405,000 mortalities and 228 million cases were reported worldwide, with Africa carrying the highest disease burden. Over the last decade, there has been a significant decline in malaria deaths and infections, which may be related to the availability of effective diagnostic techniques. However, in certain areas, the rate of decline has slowed or even reversed the gains made so far. Accurate diagnosis, adequate treatment, and management of the disease are critical WHO-set goals of eliminating malaria by 2030. Microscopy, rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), and biosensors are all currently accessible diagnostic methods. These technologies have substantial flaws and triumphs that could stymie or accelerate malaria eradication efforts. The cost, ease, accessibility, and availability of skilled persons all influence the use of these technologies. These variables have a direct and indirect ramification on the entire management portfolio of patients. Despite the overall decline in the malaria disease burden driven partly by new diagnostic technologies, a sobering pattern marked by limited number of studies and spatial as well as temporal heterogeneity remains a concern. This review summarizes the principle, performance, gaps, accomplishments, and applicability of numerous malaria diagnostic techniques and their potential role in reducing the malaria disease burden in Sub-Saharan Africa.

TI  - Sex-Biased Transcriptome of <i>Schistosoma mansoni</i>: Host-Parasite Interaction, Genetic Determinants and Epigenetic Regulators Are Associated with Sexual Differentiation
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   Among more than 20,000 species of hermaphroditic trematodes, Schistosomatidae are unusual since they have evolved gonochorism. In schistosomes, sex is determined by a female heterogametic system, but phenotypic sexual dimorphism appears only after infection of the vertebrate definitive host. The completion of gonad maturation occurs even later, after pairing. To date, the molecular mechanisms that trigger the sexual differentiation in these species remain unknown, and in vivo studies on the developing schistosomulum stages are lacking. To study the molecular basis of sex determination and sexual differentiation in schistosomes, we investigated the whole transcriptome of the human parasite Schistosoma mansoni in a stage-and sex-comparative manner.
   Methodology/Principal Findings
   We performed a RNA-seq on males and females for five developmental stages: cercariae larvae, three in vivo schistosomulum stages and adults. We detected 7,168 genes differentially expressed between sexes in at least one of the developmental stages, and 4,065 of them were functionally annotated. Transcriptome data were completed with H3K27me3 histone modification analysis using ChIP-Seq before (in cercariae) and after (in adults) the phenotypic sexual dimorphism appearance. In this paper we present (i) candidate determinants of the sexual differentiation, (ii) sex-biased players of the interaction with the vertebrate host, and (iii) different dynamic of the H3K27me3 histone mark between sexes as an illustration of sex-biased epigenetic landscapes.
   Conclusions/Significance
   Our work presents evidence that sexual differentiation in S. mansoni is accompanied by distinct male and female transcriptional landscapes of known players of the host-parasite crosstalk, genetic determinants and epigenetic regulators. Our results suggest that such combination could lead to the optimized sexual dimorphism of this parasitic species. As S. mansoni is pathogenic for humans, this study represents a promising source of therapeutic targets, providing not only data on the parasite development in interaction with its vertebrate host, but also new insights on its reproductive function.

TI  - Professional Consumer Perceptions about Thermally Modified Wood
T2  - BIORESOURCES
AB  - Thermal modification of wood is a chemical-free treatment that results in improved durability, enhanced dimensional stability, and a change in color throughout the entire thickness of the wood. Thermally Modified Wood (TMW) provides an opportunity for sustainable and value-added uses for timber resources that are underutilized or affected by disease or pests. TMW has commercial success in Europe, but it is in the early stages of market adoption in the United States. The main goal of this research was to identify the challenges and opportunities for TMW in the U.S. by investigating professional adopters' perceptions of various decking materials, including thermally modified wood. In-person and online surveys were conducted for this purpose. Participants perceived that the most favorable attributes of TMW are Durability, Environmental Performance, and Aesthetics. Professional users of decking materials also considered the Cost of TMW to be relatively high, but competitive with that of tropical hardwoods and wood-plastic composites. A block of conjoint analysis questions helped to uncover the target audience's priorities and tradeoffs that they are willing to make between the different product attributes. Results from this research are useful to inform the formulation of effective marketing strategies.

T2  - BIOTA NEOTROPICA
AB  - We analyzed the overlap of the range of Pygochelidon melanoleuca in Brazil with active and planned hydropower plants in the country (current and future scenarios). We used the Random Forest, Maxent and Support Vector Machine algorithms to model the potential range of the species, which we then overlapped with the locations of active and planned hydropower plants in order to calculate how much the potential area of this species is and will be affected by them. Approximately 35% of active hydropower plants currently overlap with the potential distribution area of P. melanoleuca, and 44% of planned hydropower plants also coincide with this area. If the implementation of the planned hydropower plants occurs, the suitable habitat necessary for nesting and foraging of P. melanoleuca will be severely compromised.

TI  - Tree species recognition system based on macroscopic image analysis
T2  - WOOD SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB  - An automated wood texture recognition system of 48 tropical wood species is presented. For each wood species, 100 macroscopic texture images are captured from different timber logs where 70 images are used for training while 30 images are used for testing. In this work, a fuzzy pre-classifier is used to complement a set of support vector machines (SVM) to manage the large wood database and classify the wood species efficiently. Given a test image, a set of texture pore features is extracted from the image and used as inputs to a fuzzy pre-classifier which assigns it to one of the four broad categories. Then, another set of texture features is extracted from the image and used with the SVM dedicated to the selected category to further classify the test image to a particular wood species. The advantage of dividing the database into four smaller databases is that when a new wood species is added into the system, only the SVM classifier of one of the four databases needs to be retrained instead of those of the entire database. This shortens the training time and emulates the experts' reasoning when expanding the wood database. The results show that the proposed model is more robust as the size of wood database is increased.

TI  - Habitat disturbance influences the skin microbiome of a rediscovered neotropical-montane frog
T2  - BMC MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Background The skin microbiome serves as a first line defense against pathogens in vertebrates. In amphibians, it has the potential to protect against the chytrid fungusBatrachochytrium dendrobatis(Bd), a likely agent of amphibian declines. Alteration of the microbiome associated with unfavorable environmental changes produced by anthropogenic activities may make the host more susceptible to pathogens. Some amphibian species that were thought to be "extinct" have been rediscovered years after population declines in the late 1980s probably due to evolvedBd-resistance and are now threatened by anthropogenic land-use changes. Understanding the effects of habitat disturbance on the host skin microbiome is relevant for understanding the health of these species, along with its susceptibility to pathogens such asBd. Here, we investigate the influence of habitat alteration on the skin bacterial communities as well as specifically the putativeBd-inhibitory bacterial communities of the montane frogLithobates vibicarius. This species, after years of not being observed, was rediscovered in small populations inhabiting undisturbed and disturbed landscapes, and with continuous presence ofBd. Results We found that cutaneous bacterial communities of tadpoles and adults differed between undisturbed and disturbed habitats. The adults from disturbed habitats exhibited greater community dispersion than those from undisturbed habitats. We observed a higher richness of putativeBd-inhibitory bacterial strains in adults from disturbed habitats than in those from undisturbed habitats, as well as a greater number of these potential protective bacteria with a high relative abundance. Conclusions Our findings support the microbial "Anna Karenina principle", in which disturbance is hypothesized to cause greater microbial dispersion in communities, a so-called dysbiosis, which is a response of animal microbiomes to stress factors that decrease the ability of the host or its microbiome to regulate community composition. On the positive side, the high richness and relative abundance of putativeBd-inhibitory bacteria may indicate the development of a defense mechanism that enhancesBd-protection, attributed to a co-occurrence of more than 30-years of host and pathogen in these disturbed habitats. Our results provide important insight into the influence of human-modified landscapes on the skin microbiome and health implications ofBd-survivor species.

TI  - Yellow fever outbreak affecting Alouatta populations in southern Brazil (Rio Grande do Sul State), 2008-2009
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY
AB  - The natural transmission cycle of Yellow Fever (YF) involves tree hole breeding mosquitoes and a wide array of nonhuman primates (NHP), including monkeys and apes. Some Neotropical monkeys (howler monkeys, genus Alouatta) develop fatal YF virus (YFV) infections similar to those reported in humans, even with minimum exposure to the infection. Epizootics in wild primates may be indicating YFV circulation, and the surveillance of such outbreaks in wildlife is an important tool to help prevent human infection. In 2001, surveillance activities successfully identified YF-related death in a black-and-gold howler monkey (Alouatta caraya), Rio Grande do Sul State (RGS) in southern Brazil, and the YFV was isolated from a species of forest-dwelling mosquito (Haemagogus leucocelaenus). These findings led the State Secretariat of Health to initiate a monitoring program for YF and other 18 arboviral infections in Alouatta monkeys. The monitoring program included monkey captures, reporting of monkey casualties by municipalities, and subsequent investigations. If monkey carcasses were found in forests, samples were collected in a standardized manner and this practice resulted in increased reporting of outbreaks. In October 2008, a single howler monkey in a northwestern RGS municipality was confirmed to have died from YF. From October 2008 to June 2009, 2,013 monkey deaths were reported (830 A. caraya and 1,183 A. guariba clamitans). Viruses isolation in blood, viscera, and/or immunohistochemistry led to the detection of YF in 204 of 297 (69%) (154 A. g. clamitans and 50 A. caraya) dead Alouatta monkeys tested. The number of municipalities with confirmed YFV circulation in howlers increased from 2 to 67 and 21 confirmed human cases occurred. This surveillance system was successful in identifying the largest YF outbreak affecting wild NHP ever recorded. Am. J. Primatol. 74:6876, 2012. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - Impact of Malaysian palm oil on sustainable development goals: co-benefits and trade-offs across mitigation strategies
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE
AB  - Palm oil (PO) is an important source of livelihood, but unsustainable practices and widespread consumption may threaten human and planetary health. We reviewed 234 articles and summarized evidence on the impact of PO on health, social and economic aspects, environment, and biodiversity in the Malaysian context, and discuss mitigation strategies based on the sustainable development goals (SDGs). The evidence on health impact of PO is equivocal, with knowledge gaps on whether moderate consumption elevates risk for chronic diseases, but the benefits of phytonutrients (SDG2) and sensory characteristics of PO seem offset by its high proportion of saturated fat (SDG3). While PO contributes to economic growth (SDG9, 12), poverty alleviation (SDG1, 8, 10), enhanced food security (SDG2), alternative energy (SDG9), and long-term employment opportunities (SDG1), human rights issues and inequities attributed to PO production persist (SDG8). Environmental impacts arise through large-scale expansion of monoculture plantations associated with increased greenhouse gas emissions (SDG13), especially from converted carbon-rich peat lands, which can cause forest fires and annual trans-boundary haze; changes in microclimate properties and soil nutrient content (SDG6, 13); increased sedimentation and change of hydrological properties of streams near slopes (SDG6); and increased human wildlife conflicts, increase of invasive species occurrence, and reduced biodiversity (SDG14, 15). Practices such as biological pest control, circular waste management, multi-cropping and certification may mitigate negative impacts on environmental SDGs, without hampering progress of socioeconomic SDGs. While strategies focusing on improving practices within and surrounding plantations offer co-benefits for socioeconomic, environment and biodiversity-related SDGs, several challenges in achieving scalable solutions must be addressed to ensure holistic sustainability of PO in Malaysia for various stakeholders.

TI  - Phlebotomine sandflies fauna (Diptera: Psychodidae) at rural settlements in the municipality of Caceres, State of Mato Grosso, Brazil
T2  - REVISTA DA SOCIEDADE BRASILEIRA DE MEDICINA TROPICAL
AB  - Introduction: Leishmaniasis is expanding across Brazil, including the State of Mato Grosso (MT). The aim of this study was to characterize the phlebotomine sandfly fauna at three rural settlements located in the municipality of Caceres, MT, from August 2010 to July 2011. Methods: Sandfly captures were conducted at the forest border and in intra and peridomicile areas with automatic light traps, biweekly, from 5pm to 6am. Results: Of the 630 sandflies collected, 348 were female, and 282 were male. Captured specimens were distributed across 11 genera - Brumptomyia, Evandromyia, Expapillata, Lutzomyia, Martinsmyia, Micropygomyia, Nyssomyia, Pintomyia, Psathyromyia, Psychodopygus, and Sciopemyia - and 28 species. Among these, six species had not been marked yet in MT (Brumptomyia avellari, Br. mangabeirai, Evandromyia aldafalcaoae, Micropygomyia echinatopharynx, Micropygomyia peresi, and Pa. campograndensis). Nyssomyia whitmani was the most abundant species across ecotopes at all settlements. Interestingly, Lutzomyia longipalpis and Lutzomyia cruzi were found in sympatry. Conclusions: The disorganized occupation of the environment that is happening at the rural settlements of Mata Comprida, Laranjeira I and II could provide opportunities for the domiciliation of wild populations of phlebotomine, including vectors of leishmaniasis. Therefore, more studies are needed to understand the epidemiology of the disease in these areas and its impact on the human population.

TI  - The ecological drivers and consequences of wildlife trade
T2  - BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS
AB  - Wildlife trade is a key driver of extinction risk, affecting at least 24% of terrestrial vertebrates. The persistent removal of species can have profound impacts on species extinction risk and selection within populations. We draw together the first review of characteristics known to drive species use - identifying species with larger body sizes, greater abundance, increased rarity or certain morphological traits valued by consumers as being particularly prevalent in trade. We then review the ecological implications of this trade-driven selection, revealing direct effects of trade on natural selection and populations for traded species, which includes selection against desirable traits. Additionally, there exists a positive feedback loop between rarity and trade and depleted populations tend to have easy human access points, which can result in species being harvested to extinction and has the potential to alter source-sink dynamics. Wider cascading ecosystem repercussions from trade-induced declines include altered seed dispersal networks, trophic cascades, long-term compositional changes in plant communities, altered forest carbon stocks, and the introduction of harmful invasive species. Because it occurs across multiple scales with diverse drivers, wildlife trade requires multi-faceted conservation actions to maintain biodiversity and ecological function, including regulatory and enforcement approaches, bottom-up and community-based interventions, captive breeding or wildlife farming, and conservation translocations and trophic rewilding. We highlight three emergent research themes at the intersection of trade and community ecology: (1) functional impacts of trade; (2) altered provisioning of ecosystem services; and (3) prevalence of trade-dispersed diseases. Outside of the primary objective that exploitation is sustainable for traded species, we must urgently incorporate consideration of the broader consequences for other species and ecosystem processes when quantifying sustainability.

TI  - Checklist of parasites associated with Modified Letter Turned Commareptiles' in Northeast Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF HELMINTHOLOGY
AB  - Reptiles, as well as other vertebrate groups, harbour a significant diversity of parasitic organisms, from nematodes and other helminths to viruses and bacteria. The Northeast is one of the richest regions in Brazil in terms of the reptile diversity, number of species and endemism. Parasites are diverse organisms and knowledge about the parasitic fauna of vertebrates is an important factor in understanding the ecological relationships between hosts and the environment. Studies on the parasitic fauna of reptiles in South America have increased in the past few years. The present review is a compilation of 122 studies published from 1924 to 2021. We present information on 101 species of reptiles from five groups (amphisbaenians, crocodile, testudines, snakes and lizards) and 183 parasitic taxa belonging to four phyla: Nematoda; Arthropoda; Platyhelminthes; and Acanthocephala. Nematodes were the most frequently recorded species. Lizards and snakes had more records of parasitism and higher levels of parasite richness and diversity. Ceara was the state with most studies and recorded cases of parasite-host association. The Caatinga and Atlantic Forest were the most investigated environments. The objective of this review was to contribute knowledge on the parasitic biodiversity in reptiles from Northeast Brazil, which may help identify gaps in our knowledge and guide future studies.

TI  - Spatial patterns of and risk factors for seropositivity for dengue infection
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Spatial patterns of and risk factors for seropositivity of dengue infection were studied in three sites in northern Thailand. A survey was conducted in 2001 among 1,750 persons. Potential risk factors for dengue infection were measured by questionnaire and IgM antibodies against dengue were detected by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The role of landscape as a risk factor was studied using land cover maps and a geographic information system. Logistic regression identified risk factors for dengue seropositivity. Spatial patterns of seropositive cases were determined by cluster analyses. Six percent of the study population was seropositive. Risk factors for dengue seropositivity differed per site. demonstrating variation in local infection patterns. In the periurban site, seropositivity depended on human behavior and factors related to housing quality rather than environmental factors. In both rural sites, older persons had a higher risk of seropositivity and persons living in houses surrounded by natural and agricultural land covers had a lower risk of seropositivity.

TI  - Asia-Pacific ICEMR: Understanding Malaria Transmission to Accelerate Malaria Elimination in the Asia Pacific Region
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Gaining an in-depth understanding of malaria transmission requires integrated, multifaceted research approaches. The Asia-Pacific International Center of Excellence in Malaria Research (ICEMR) is applying specifically developed molecular and immunological assays, in-depth entomological assessments, and advanced statistical and mathematical modeling approaches to a rich series of longitudinal cohort and cross-sectional studies in Papua New Guinea and Cambodia. This is revealing both the essential contribution of forest-based transmission and the particular challenges posed by Plasmodium vivax to malaria elimination in Cambodia. In Papua New Guinea, these studies docu-ment the complex host-vector-parasite interactions that are underlying both the stunning reductions in malaria burden from 2006 to 2014 and the significant resurgence in transmission in 2016 to 2018. Here we describe the novel analytical, surveillance, molecular, and immunological tools that are being applied in our ongoing Asia-Pacific ICEMR research program.

TI  - Heterogeneity of Environments Associated with Transmission of Visceral Leishmaniasis in South-Eastern France and Implication for Control Strategies
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background: Visceral leishmaniasis due to Leishmania infantum is currently spreading into new foci across Europe. Leishmania infantum transmission in the Old World was reported to be strongly associated with a few specific environments. Environmental changes due to global warming or human activity were therefore incriminated in the spread of the disease. However, comprehensive studies were lacking to reliably identify all the environments at risk and thereby optimize monitoring and control strategy.
   Methodology/Findings: We exhaustively collected 328 cases of autochthonous visceral leishmaniasis from 1993 to 2009 in South-Eastern France. Leishmaniasis incidence decreased from 31 yearly cases between 1993 and 1997 to 12 yearly cases between 2005 and 2009 mostly because Leishmania/HIV coinfection were less frequent. No spread of human visceral leishmaniasis was observed in the studied region. Two major foci were identified, associated with opposite environments: whereas one involved semi-rural hillside environments partly made of mixed forests, the other involved urban and peri-urban areas in and around the region main town, Marseille. The two neighboring foci were related to differing environments despite similar vectors (P. perniciosus), canine reservoir, parasite (L. infantum zymodeme MON-1), and human host.
   Conclusions/Significance: This unprecedented collection of cases highlighted the occurrence of protracted urban transmission of L. infantum in France, a worrisome finding as the disease is currently spreading in other areas around the Mediterranean. These results complete previous studies about more widespread canine leishmaniasis or human asymptomatic carriage. This first application of systematic geostatistical methods to European human visceral leishmaniasis demonstrated an unsuspected heterogeneity of environments associated with the transmission of the disease. These findings modify the current view of leishmaniasis epidemiology. They notably stress the need for locally defined control strategies and extensive monitoring including in urban environments.

TI  - Automated detection of frog calls and choruses by pulse repetition rate
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
AB  - Anurans (frogs and toads) are among the most globally threatened taxonomic groups. Successful conservation of anurans will rely on improved data on the status and changes in local populations, particularly for rare and threatened species. Automated sensors, such as acoustic recorders, have the potential to provide such data by massively increasing the spatial and temporal scale of population sampling efforts. Analyzing such data sets will require robust and efficient tools that can automatically identify the presence of a species in audio recordings. Like bats and birds, many anuran species produce distinct vocalizations that can be captured by autonomous acoustic recorders and represent excellent candidates for automated recognition. However, in contrast to birds and bats, effective automated acoustic recognition tools for anurans are not yet widely available. An effective automated call-recognition method for anurans must be robust to the challenges of real-world field data and should not require extensive labeled data sets. We devised a vocalization identification tool that classifies anuran vocalizations in audio recordings based on their periodic structure: the repeat interval-based bioacoustic identification tool (RIBBIT). We applied RIBBIT to field recordings to study the boreal chorus frog (Pseudacris maculata) of temperate North American grasslands and the critically endangered variable harlequin frog (Atelopus varius) of tropical Central American rainforests. The tool accurately identified boreal chorus frogs, even when they vocalized in heavily overlapping choruses and identified variable harlequin frog vocalizations at a field site where it had been very rarely encountered in visual surveys. Using a few simple parameters, RIBBIT can detect any vocalization with a periodic structure, including those of many anurans, insects, birds, and mammals. We provide open-source implementations of RIBBIT in Python and R to support its use for other taxa and communities.

TI  - Is mahogany dysgenically selected?
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION
AB  - One concern in the ongoing debate over the conservation status of mahogany has been the possibility that selective logging, as a form of negative phenotypic selection, might have led to deterioration in the genetic quality of populations. The incidence and degree of such 'dysgenic' effects is discussed, based on a consideration of mahogany logging practices, their expected genetic effects and empirical data on phenotypic selection in forest trees. Loggers have tended to avoid diseased, small, very large and poorly-formed individuals, and consequently logging has tended to increase the proportion of poor quality phenotypes relative to that before logging; in at least some conditions, selection differentials have been strongly negative. However, the upper limit for heritability of logger-selected traits in naturally-regenerated mahogany is probably no more than c. 0.1. Consequently, and assuming relatively extreme but realistic negative selection differentials of 50%, the maximum negative dysgenic response to a single logging-mediated phenotypic selection event is expected to be relatively small, i.e. <= 5%. This expectation is consistent with the empirical information from mahogany and other taxa. The implications of any dysgenic effects depend very much on the use and the future of dysgenically-selected populations. In managed populations, dysgenic effects could be reversed through positive selection. In the case of exploited but currently unmanaged natural populations, dysgenic selection is primarily of importance insofar as it affects fitness. As a threat to mahogany conservation and long-term sustainable production, it is probably insignificant in comparison with other genetic and non-genetic factors.

TI  - NEW VARIANT OF SIMIAN T-LYMPHOTROPIC RETROVIRUS (STLV-1F) AMONG PAPIO-HAMADRYAS OF SUKHUMI MONKEY STOCK
T2  - VOPROSY VIRUSOLOGII
AB  - Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was developed for the detection of simian T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (STLV-1) infection of P. hamadryas and direct sequencing using oligonucleotide primer paiers specific for the tax and env regions of the related human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1). Excellent specificity was shown in the detection of STLV-1 provirus in infected baboons by PCR using HTLV-1-derived primers. The nucleotide sequences of env 467bp and tax 159bp of the proviral genome (env position 5700-6137, tax position 7373-7498 HTLV-1, according to Seiki et al., 1983) derived from STLV-1-infected P. hamadryas were analysed using PCR and direct sequencing techniques. Two STLV-1 isolates from different sources (Sukhumi main-SuTLV-1 and forest stocks-STLV-1F) were compared. Two variants of STLV-1 among P. hamadryas with different level of homology to HTLV-1 were wound (83.8 % and 95.2 %, respectively). A possible role of nucleotide changes in env and tax sequenced fragments and oncogenicity of STLV-1 variants is discussed.

TI  - Loiasis
T2  - ANNALS OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND PARASITOLOGY
AB  - Loiasis affects millions of individuals living in the forest and savannah regions of Central Africa. In some areas, this disease constitutes one of the most common reasons for medical consultation. The burden posed by loiasis is probably under-estimated and, in addition, individuals harbouring high Loa microfilarial loads are at risk of developing serious neurological reactions after treatment with diethylcarbamazine or ivermectin. These events are currently significantly hampering the development of the African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control, and operational research is required to address the issue. The results of recent studies, involving either human populations from endemic areas or monkey models, have provided much more detail of the mechanisms associated with amicrofilaraemic or so-called 'occult' loiasis. New diagnostic tools have also been developed in the last decade, and various protocols are now available for the risk-free treatment of loiasis cases.

TI  - Predicted Distribution of Major Malaria Vectors Belonging to the <i>Anopheles dirus</i> Complex in Asia: Ecological Niche and Environmental Influences
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Methods derived from ecological niche modeling allow to define species distribution based on presence-only data. This is particularly useful to develop models from literature records such as available for the Anopheles dirus complex, a major group of malaria mosquito vectors in Asia. This research defines an innovative modeling design based on presence-only model and hierarchical framework to define the distribution of the complex and attempt to delineate sibling species distribution and environmental preferences. At coarse resolution, the potential distribution was defined using slow changing abiotic factors such as topography and climate representative for the timescale covered by literature records of the species. The distribution area was then refined in a second step using a mask of current suitable land cover. Distribution area and ecological niche were compared between species and environmental factors tested for relevance. Alternatively, extreme values at occurrence points were used to delimit environmental envelopes. The spatial distribution for the complex was broadly consistent with its known distribution and influencing factors included temperature and rainfall. If maps developed from environmental envelopes gave similar results to modeling when the number of sites was high, the results were less similar for species with low number of recorded presences. Using presence-only models and hierarchical framework this study not only predicts the distribution of a major malaria vector, but also improved ecological modeling analysis design and proposed final products better adapted to malaria control decision makers. The resulting maps can help prioritizing areas which need further investigation and help simulate distribution under changing conditions such as climate change or reforestation. The hierarchical framework results in two products one abiotic based model describes the potential maximal distribution and remains valid for decades and the other including a biotic mask easy to update with frequently available information gives current species distribution.

TI  - Azithromycin for acute lower respiratory tract infections
T2  - COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS
AB  - Background
   Acute lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) range fromacute bronchitis and acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis to pneumonia. Approximately five million people die from acute respiratory tract infections annually. Among these, pneumonia represents the most frequent cause of mortality, hospitalisation and medical consultation. Azithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic, structurally modified from erythromycin and noted for its activity against some gram-negative organisms associated with respiratory tract infections, particularly Haemophilus influenzae (H. influenzae).
   Objectives
   To compare the effectiveness of azithromycin to amoxycillin or amoxycillin/clavulanic acid (amoxyclav) in the treatment of LRTI, in terms of clinical failure, incidence of adverse events and microbial eradication.
   Search methods
   We searched CENTRAL (2014, Issue 10), MEDLINE (January 1966 to October week 4, 2014) and EMBASE (January 1974 to November 2014).
   Selection criteria
   Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs, comparing azithromycin to amoxycillin or amoxycillin/clavulanic acid in participants with clinical evidence of an acute LRTI, such as acute bronchitis, pneumonia and acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis.
   Data collection and analysis
   The review authors independently assessed all potential studies identified from the searches for methodological quality. We extracted and analysed relevant data separately. We resolved discrepancies through discussion. We initially pooled all types of acute LRTI in the meta-analyses. We investigated the heterogeneity of results using the forest plot and Chi(2) test. We also used the index of the I-2 statistic to measure inconsistent results among trials. We conducted subgroup and sensitivity analyses.
   Main results
   We included 16 trials involving 2648 participants. We were able to analyse 15 of the trials with 2496 participants. The pooled analysis of all the trials showed that there was no significant difference in the incidence of clinical failure on about days 10 to 14 between the two groups (risk ratio (RR), random-effects 1.09; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.64 to 1.85). A subgroup analysis in trials with acute bronchitis participants showed significantly lower clinical failure in the azithromycin group compared to amoxycillin or amoxyclav (RR random-effects 0.63; 95% CI 0.45 to 0.88). A sensitivity analysis showed a non-significant reduction in clinical failure in azithromycin treated participants (RR 0.55; 95% CI 0.25 to 1.21) in three adequately concealed studies, compared to RR 1.32; 95% CI 0.70 to 2.49 in 12 studies with inadequate concealment. Twelve trials reported the incidence of microbial eradication and there was no significant difference between the two groups (RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.87 to 1.03). The reduction of adverse events in the azithromycin group was RR 0.76 (95% CI 0.57 to 1.00).
   Authors' conclusions
   There is unclear evidence that azithromycin is superior to amoxycillin or amoxyclav in treating acute LRTI. In patients with acute bronchitis of a suspected bacterial cause, azithromycin tends to be more effective in terms of lower incidence of treatment failure and adverse events than amoxycillin or amoxyclav. However, most studies were of unclear methodological quality and had small sample sizes; future trials of high methodological quality and adequate sizes are needed.

TI  - <i>Colletotrichum</i>species causing anthracnose on avocado fruit in Mexico: Current status
T2  - PLANT PATHOLOGY
AB  - Colletotrichumspecies cause anthracnose disease in tropical and subtropical fruit crops worldwide. Mexico is the main producer and exporter of avocado (Persea americana) globally and has yearly outbreaks of anthracnose on this crop. However, which specificColletotrichumspp. cause these outbreaks in avocado-producing regions remain uncertain; thus, the objective of the present study was to identify the species responsible. A survey performed in six production regions of Mexico yielded 232 isolates, from which a subset of 104 strains was selected based on morphological characteristics and origin. This subset was sequenced and haplotypes were analysed in thegapdhpartial gene. Finally, 31 strains were identified through multilocus phylogenetic analyses using the sequences of the internal transcribed spacer region and six loci. This study revealed the presence of two species previously reported in Mexico (C.karstiandC.godetiae), three novel records in Mexico (C.siamense,C.fioriniae, andC.cigarro), four novel records on avocado (C.chrysophilum,C.jiangxiense,C.tropicale, andC.nymphaeae), and two novel lineages (Colletotrichumsp. 1 andColletotrichumsp. 2).C. siamensewas the most prevalent, while the species reported for the first time on avocado, including the novel lineages, were the least prevalent.C.karstiwas the most widespread (four regions), followed byC.siamense,C.jiangxiense, andC.chrysophilum(three regions). Pathogenicity tests showed that all species caused anthracnose on avocado fruit. These findings will be useful for improving the management of avocado anthracnose outbreaks in Mexico.

TI  - <i>De novo</i> transcriptomic assembly and profiling of <i>Rigidoporus microporus</i> during saprotrophic growth on rubber wood
T2  - BMC GENOMICS
AB  - Background: The basidiomycete Rigidoporus microporus is a fungus that causes the white rot disease of the tropical rubber tree, Hevea brasiliensis, the major source of commercial natural rubber. Besides its lifestyle as a pathogen, the fungus is known to switch to saprotrophic growth on wood with the ability to degrade both lignin and cellulose. There is almost no genomic or transcriptomic information on the saprotrophic abilities of this fungus. In this study, we present the fungal transcriptomic profiles during saprotrophic growth on rubber wood.
   Results: A total of 266.6 million RNA-Seq reads were generated from six libraries of the fungus growing either on rubber wood or without wood. De novo assembly produced 34, 518 unigenes with an average length of 217(bp. Annotation of unigenes using public databases; GenBank, Swiss-Prot, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), Cluster of Orthologous Groups (COG) and Gene Ontology (GO) produced 25, 880 annotated unigenes. Transcriptomic profiling analysis revealed that the fungus expressed over 300 genes encoding lignocellulolytic enzymes. Among these, 175 genes were up-regulated in rubber wood. These include three members of the glycoside hydrolase family 43, as well as various glycosyl transferases, carbohydrate esterases and polysaccharide lyases. A large number of oxidoreductases which includes nine manganese peroxidases were also significantly up-regulated in rubber wood. Several genes involved in fatty acid metabolism and degradation as well as natural rubber degradation were expressed in the transcriptome. Four genes (acyl-CoA synthetase, enoyl-CoA hydratase, 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase and acyl-CoA acetyltransferase) potentially involved in rubber latex degradation pathway were also induced. A number of ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters and hydrophobin genes were significantly expressed in the transcriptome during saprotrophic growth. Some genes related to energy metabolism were also induced.
   Conclusions: The analysed data gives an insight into the activation of lignocellulose breakdown machinery of R. microporus. This study also revealed genes with relevance in antibiotic metabolism (e.g. cephalosporin esterase) as well as those with potential applications in fatty acid degradation. This is the first study on the transcriptomic analysis of R. microporus on rubber wood and should serve as a pioneering resource for future studies of the fungus at the genomic or transcriptomic level.

TI  - Host life-history traits predict haemosporidian parasite prevalence in tanagers (Aves: Thraupidae)
T2  - PARASITOLOGY
AB  - Vector-borne parasites are important ecological drivers influencing life-history evolution in birds by increasing host mortality or susceptibility to new diseases. Therefore, understanding why vulnerability to infection varies within a host Glade is a crucial task for conservation biology and for understanding macroecological life-history patterns. Here, we studied the relationship of avian life-history traits and climate on the prevalence of Plasmodium and Parahaemoproteus parasites. We sampled 3569 individual birds belonging to 53 species of the family Thraupidae. Individuals were captured from 2007 to 2018 at 92 locations. We created 2 phylogenetic generalized least-squares models with Plasmodium and Parahaemoproteus prevalence as our response variables, and with the following predictor variables: climate PC1, climate PC2, body size, mixed-species flock participation, incubation period, migration, nest height, foraging height, forest cover, and diet. We found that Parahaemoproteus and Plasmodium prevalence was higher in species inhabiting open habitats. Tanager species with longer incubation periods had higher Parahaemoproteus prevalence as well, and we hypothesize that these longer incubation periods overlap with maximum vector abundances, resulting in a higher probability of infection among adult hosts during their incubation period and among chicks. Lastly, we found that Plasmodium prevalence was higher in species without migratory behaviour, with mixed-species flock participation, and with an omnivorous or animal-derived diet. We discuss the consequences of higher infection prevalence in relation to life-history traits in tanagers.

TI  - Dispersal and survival of radio-sterilised male <i>Aedes albopictus</i> Skuse (Diptera: Culicidae) and estimation of the wild populations in view of an sterile insect technique programme in Pointe des Lascars, Mauritius
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TROPICAL INSECT SCIENCE
AB  - The survival and dispersal of irradiated and non-irradiated Aedes albopictus Skuse (Diptera: Culicidae) males, bred in mass-rearing larval racks, were investigated during three mark-release-recapture trials in Pointe des Lascars (PDL), a village in Mauritius. Adult males of 1-day-old, 3-day-old and 5-day-old, were released in two different ecotypes (inhabited village center and forest). Overall recapture rates ranged from 2.9 to 8.6% which supports the use of the `Mosquibat', a hand-held device conceived during this study, for collecting Ae. albopictus males. Irradiation and age of males at release, did not significantly affect their recapture and dispersal while ecotype and climatic seasons had a visible effect on both parameters. The average mean distance travelled (MDT) by males in the forest was greater than those in the village center (ranging from 89.6 to 120.8 m and 55.5 to 84.2 m respectively). Furthermore, an important Ae. albopictus population exhibiting characteristic seasonal fluctuations is present in PDL with mean male estimates ranging from 622 (95% CI, 471-773) to 3344 (95% CI, 2258-4429) males per hectare during the study. Hence, should an SIT programme be implemented against the vector in PDL, a reduction of its wild population by conventional control methods is highly desirable prior to releases.

TI  - <i>Paederus</i> beetles: the agent of human dermatitis
T2  - JOURNAL OF VENOMOUS ANIMALS AND TOXINS INCLUDING TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background: Rove beetles of the genus Paederus cause dermatitis when they come in contact with human skin. This condition is prevalent in some tropical and subtropical regions, such as in northern Pakistan, where it was recorded for the first time by US troops. Despite much research from other countries on this subject, few studies, mostly clinical, have been performed in a Pakistani context. A survey was carried out in villages, towns and cities of Punjab province, Pakistan, to explore the rove beetle population dynamics and to develop a model to elucidate the symptoms, preventive measures and treatment strategies for this dermatitis.
   Methods: The prospective observational and patient surveys were performed bimonthly over a period of two years, in different districts of Punjab province. Collection was carried out in fields, gardens and houses during every visit with the aid of a pitfall trap, light trap, flight intercept trap, Berlese funnel trap and sweep netting. These traps were installed for four days during every visit. Interviews of ten individuals of different ages and sexes from each site were recorded during each visit.
   Results: Out of 980 individuals, 26.4% were found to suffer from Paederus dermatitis. Lesions were most commonly found on the neck followed by the face. In July-August during the rainy season, this skin irritation was most prevalent and the population of these beetles peaked (36.2%). During May-June, the beetle population was lowest (7.85%) due to soil dryness. About 70% of such irritation cases were from individuals living in farming villages or in farmhouses. Their houses typically (80%) had broken doors and screen-less windows while 97% of the residents were unaware of how they may have come into contact with these beetles. In most cases (91% from villages/small towns and 24% from cities and adjoining areas) the local residents were unaware of modern treatment strategies.
   Conclusions: Paederus dermatitis is extremely frequent in villages with poor housing facilities and could be avoided via community awareness.

TI  - Apoptosis and abundance of Bcl-2 family and transforming growth factor β1 signaling proteins in canine myxomatous mitral valves
T2  - JOURNAL OF VETERINARY CARDIOLOGY
AB  - Objectives: To determine the percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis within canine myxomatous valves and to evaluate whether TGF beta 1 can be implicated as an anti-apoptosic signal through the Bcl-2 family of signaling proteins.
   Animals: Post-mortem mitral valve leaflets harvested from 5 normal dogs, 5 dogs with early-stage myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD), and 5 dogs with late-stage MMVD.
   Materials and methods: The number of cells expressing cleaved caspase-3, DNA fragmentation (TUNEL marker) and apoptotic bodies were evaluated as a measure of apoptosis. To evaluate the relationship between TGF beta 1 signaling and apoptosis, the abundance of activated TGF beta 1 signaling protein, phosphorylated Smad 2/3 (p-Smad 2/3), and Bcl-2 family proteins (pro-apoptotic Bax and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2) was determined by immunohistochemistry.
   Results: Cells in normal and both stages of MMVD expressed the TUNEL marker and cleaved caspase-3, but not apoptotic bodies. The percentage of TUNEL marker and cleaved caspase-3 positive nuclei was not significantly different between groups of dogs (p>0.05). P-Smad 2/3 and Bax were more abundant in myxomatous mitral valves while Bcl-2 was less abundant. P-Smad 2/3 primarily increased in the atrialis layer and was abundantly increased only in late-stage MMVD.
   Conclusions: These data suggest that interstitial cells in MMVD are in a pro-apoptotic condition; however, they do not execute apoptosis. Thus, apoptosis does not explain differences in cellular density in canine MMVD. TGF beta 1 signaling through the canonical SMAD pathway is increased in myxomatous mitral valves, but does not apparently mediate interstitial cell apoptosis in canine MMVD. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

T2  - NEW FORESTS
CP  - International Gmelina Workshop
AB  - Gmelina arborea Roxb. (gmelina) occurs naturally in 11 countries in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. Approximately 700,000 ha of gmelina have now been established in plantations, small woodlots and agroforestry settings in west-central and eastern Africa, southeast Asia, the South Pacific, and northern Latin America. It is expected that planting areas will expand to 800,000 ha by 2020. The species has generated interest because of its fast growth and quick return on investment. Its wood can be used for a multitude of products that range from pulp to furniture parts. Gmelina also has great utility in agroforestry systems. Intensive breeding and improved clones will bring better growth, more uniform wood, better disease resistance, and products of higher quality to both local and international markets. Several factors might limit the degree of improvement and use of gmelina: ( a) the species is susceptible to insect attacks and disease which might limit plantation expansion, (b) artificial pollinations are labor intensive and sometimes difficult to complete successfully, thus delaying breeding cycles and deployment of elite populations and clones and ( c) the wood density of gmelina is approximately 410 kg/m(3) at 8 years of age, which is lower than most commercial species of eucalypts and acacias. Low density affects pulp yields and product strength. These challenges can be met by: ( a) development of clones resistant to insect and disease attacks as a cost effective means to maintain plantation stocking and productivity, ( b) development of one-stop pollination techniques to increase pollination success rates and reduce the work loads in breeding programs, and ( c) utilization of the great tree to tree variation in wood properties in gmelina to develop new races of trees that have both desirable growth rates and dense wood. Access to a broad genetic base of gmelina is central to meeting these challenges.

TI  - Microclimate patterns on the leeside of single-row tree windbreaks during different weather conditions in Florida farms: implications for improved crop production
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB  - Florida citrus and vegetable crops generate billions of dollars in revenue every year. However, wind, freezing temperatures, hurricanes, and diseases negatively impact production. Windbreaks located perpendicular to the prevailing wind can increase farm production simply by reducing wind and modifying microclimate. Windbreaks can also help in managing pathogens such as citrus canker (Xanthomonas campestris pv. citri). To study the modification of wind speed, temperature, and relative humidity on the leeside of single-row tree windbreaks in southern Florida, automated weather stations were installed in 2007/2008 at 2 m above the ground along transects perpendicular to a eastern redcedar (Juniperus virginiana) and three cadaghi (Corymbia torelliana) (WB1-WB3) windbreaks. All windbreaks reduced wind speed, with minimum wind speed (similar to 5% of the open wind speed) at two times the distance of windbreak height (2H, where H = windbreak height in m) on the leeside of a E. redcedar (similar to 17% porosity) and at 4H (similar to 3-30% of the open wind speed) and 6H (< 50% of the open wind speed) on the leeside of cadaghi windbreaks WB1 (similar to 22% porosity) and WB2 (similar to 36% porosity), respectively, when the wind direction was nearly perpendicular to the windbreaks. Wind speed reduction was observed up to 31 times the windbreak height (31H). Cadaghi windbreaks reduced wind speed on the leeside even during a tropical storm event. Temperatures on the leeside of the windbreaks were warmer during the day and cooler near the windbreaks at night compared to temperature in the open fields. This study demonstrates that single-row tree windbreaks can reduce wind and modify the microclimate to enhance crop production for Florida growers.

TI  - Isolation and Characterization of Putative Liver-specific Enhancers in Proboscis Monkey (<i>Nasalis larvatus</i>)
T2  - PERTANIKA JOURNAL OF TROPICAL AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE
AB  - Enhancers are indispensable DNA elements responsible for elevation of gene transcriptional efficiency that regulates biological processes tightly at various developmental stages, linking them to numerous genetic diseases. Discovering the enhancer landscape of the genome will not only benefit mankind, but also aid in conservation researches involving endangered non-human primates such as the proboscis monkey. As one of the most ancient colobine endemic to Borneo Island, the proboscis monkey offers a wide spectrum of unique and exclusive characteristics that distinguish it from other primates. This study has successfully isolated 13 liver-specific enhancers from this primate and tested for their activities in HepG2 and A549 cell line. The TFBS-enriched regions such as pairs of AP-1, clusters of C/EBP-beta and triplets of HNF-1 in enhancers contributed to enhancer activities whereas huge clusters of HNF-3 beta possess suppressing effects, but generally these regions contributed to the cell specificities of enhancers. It is hoped that this study serves as a stepping stone in knowledge enrichment on this primate and future conservation researches.

TI  - <i>Mansonella perstans filariasis</i> in Uganda: patterns of microfilaraemia and clinical manifestations in two endemic communities
T2  - TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Surveys for Mansonella perstans infection and potentially related clinical manifestations were undertaken in two endemic communities in Mukono and Luwero districts of Uganda where no other human filarial infections are transmitted. A sensitive and accurate counting chamber method was used for quantifying microfitaraemia in 100 mu l of finger-prick blood. Among 575 and 991 examined individuals aged >= 1 year in the two communities, the overall microfilariae (mf) prevalence was significantly higher in Mukono (76.5%) than in Luwero (57.7%). As early as age 1-4 years, 40.6% and 20.5% of the children were mf-positive. Prevatences increased rapidly with increasing age to reach 89.2% and 81.4% in the 15-19 years age group and then remained high in subsequent age groups. The geometric mean mf intensity among mf-positive individuals was slightly higher in the Mukono community (32.4 mf/100 mu l) than in the Luwero community (29.9 mf/100 mu l), and this parameter increased with age in both communities. No obvious associations were observed between various clinical parameters and M. perstans microfitaraemia in any of the study communities. The observed patterns of microfilaraemia and the lack of obvious visible clinical manifestations suggest that the host's regutatory responses are downregulated in M. perstans infections.

TI  - Ticks and serosurvey of anti-Rickettsia spp. antibodies in wild boars (Sus scrofa), hunting dogs and hunters of Brazil
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background Rickettsia bacteria are responsible for diseases in humans and animals around the world, however few details are available regarding its ecology and circulation among wild animals and human populations at high transmission risk in Brazil. The aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence of ticks and Rickettsia spp. in wild boars, corresponding hunting dogs and hunters.
   Methods Serum samples and ticks were collected from 80 free-range wild boars, 170 hunting dogs and 34 hunters from southern and central-western Brazil, from the Atlantic Forest and Cerrado biomes, respectively, between 2016 and 2018. Serum samples were tested by indirect immunofluorescent-antibody assay (IFA) to detect IgG antibodies against Rickettsia rickettsii, Rickettsia parkeri, Rickettsia bellii, Rickettsia rhipicephali and Rickettsia amblyommatis. Tick species were identified by morphological taxonomic keys, as previously described. A total of 164 ticks including A. sculptum, A. brasiliense and A. aureolatum were tested in PCR assays for Spotted Fever Group (SFG) Rickettsia spp.
   Results A total of 58/80 (72.5%) wild boars, 24/170 (14.1%) hunting dogs and 5/34 (14.7%) hunters were positive (titers 64) to at least one Rickettsia species. A total of 669/1,584 (42.2%) ticks from wild boars were identified as Amblyomma sculptum, 910/1,584 (57.4%) as Amblyomma brasiliense, 4/1,584(0.24%) larvae of Amblyomma spp. and 1/1,584 (0.06%) nymph as Amblyolmma dubitatum. All 9 ticks found on hunting dogs were identified as Amblyomma aureolatum and all 22 ticks on hunters as A. sculptum. No tested tick was positive by standard PCR to SFG Rickettsia spp.
   Conclusions The present study was the concomitant report of wild boar, hunting dog and hunter exposure to SFG rickettsiae agents, performed in two different Brazilian biomes. Wild boar hunting may increase the risk of human exposure and consequently tick-borne disease Wild boars may be carrying and spreading capybara ticks from their original habitats to other ecosystems. Further studies can be required to explore the ability of wild boars to infecting ticks and be part of transmission cycle of Rickettsia spp.
   Author summary The present study reported serological findings and molecular assays of Rickettsia spp and ticks of wild boars, simultaneous to their correspondent hunting dogs and hunters. Seropositivity for Rickettsia spp. was higher in wild boars when compared to dogs and humans but was similar between dogs and humans. Despite Rickettsia spp. prevalence was statistically higher in southern than central-western Brazil for wild boars, no significance was observed in hunting dogs and hunters. For the first time, A. sculptum ticks were founded in wild boars from the subtropical climate of southern Brazil. Despite human beings have been considered less exposed to ticks (and therefore rickettsiae) than animals, specific human activities such as wild boar hunting may increase the risk of exposure and consequently tick-borne disease. Wild boars may be carrying and spreading capybara ticks from their original habitats to other ecosystems. These results may provide important findings for public action planning to prevent neglected vector-borne diseases in overlapping areas of wild boars, hunting dogs and hunters. Further studies can be required to explore the ability of wild boars to infecting ticks and be part of transmission cycle of Rickettsia spp.

TI  - Discrimination between <i>Onchocerca</i> <i>volvulus</i> and <i>O</i>. <i>ochengi</i> filarial larvae in <i>Simulium damnosum</i> (<i>s</i>.<i>l</i>.) and their distribution throughout central Ghana using a versatile high-resolution speciation assay
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
AB  - Background: Genetic surveillance of the human filarial parasite, Onchocerca volvulus, from onchocerciasis endemic regions will ideally focus on genotyping individual infective larval stages collected from their intermediate host, Simuliid blackflies. However, blackflies also transmit other Onchocerca species, including the cattle parasite O. ochengi, which are difficult to distinguish from the human parasite based on morphological characteristics alone. This study describes a versatile approach to discriminate between O. volvulus and O. ochengi that is demonstrated using parasite infective larvae dissected from blackflies.
   Results: A speciation assay was designed based on genetic differentiation between O. volvulus and O. ochengi mitochondrial genome sequences that can be performed in high-throughput high-resolution melt (HRM)- or lower throughput conventional restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analyses. This assay was validated on 185 Onchocerca larvae dissected from blackflies captured from 14 communities in Ghana throughout 2011-2013. The frequency of O. ochengi was approximately 67 % of all larvae analysed, which is significantly higher than previously reported in this region. Furthermore, the species distribution was not uniform throughout the study region, with 25 %, 47 % and 93 % of O. volvulus being found in the western-most (Black Volta, Tain and Tombe), the central (Pru) and eastern-most (Daka) river basins, respectively.
   Conclusions: This tool provides a simple and cost-effective approach to determine the identity and distribution of two Onchocerca species, and will be valuable for future genetic studies that focus on parasites collected from blackflies. The results presented highlight the need to discriminate Onchocerca species in transmission studies, as the frequency of each species varied significantly between the communities studied.

TI  - Global and regional mortality from 235 causes of death for 20 age groups in 1990 and 2010: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010
T2  - LANCET
AB  - Background Reliable and timely information on the leading causes of death in populations, and how these are changing, is a crucial input into health policy debates. In the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2010 (GBD 2010), we aimed to estimate annual deaths for the world and 21 regions between 1980 and 2010 for 235 causes, with uncertainty intervals (UIs), separately by age and sex.
   Methods We attempted to identify all available data on causes of death for 187 countries from 1980 to 2010 from vital registration, verbal autopsy, mortality surveillance, censuses, surveys, hospitals, police records, and mortuaries. We assessed data quality for completeness, diagnostic accuracy, missing data, stochastic variations, and probable causes of death. We applied six different modelling strategies to estimate cause-specific mortality trends depending on the strength of the data. For 133 causes and three special aggregates we used the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm) approach, which uses four families of statistical models testing a large set of different models using different permutations of covariates. Model ensembles were developed from these component models. We assessed model performance with rigorous out-of-sample testing of prediction error and the validity of 95% UIs. For 13 causes with low observed numbers of deaths, we developed negative binomial models with plausible covariates. For 27 causes for which death is rare, we modelled the higher level cause in the cause hierarchy of the GBD 2010 and then allocated deaths across component causes proportionately, estimated from all available data in the database. For selected causes (African trypanosomiasis, congenital syphilis, whooping cough, measles, typhoid and parathyroid, leishmaniasis, acute hepatitis E, and HIV/AIDS), we used natural history models based on information on incidence, prevalence, and case-fatality. We separately estimated cause fractions by aetiology for diarrhoea, lower respiratory infections, and meningitis, as well as disaggregations by subcause for chronic kidney disease, maternal disorders, cirrhosis, and liver cancer. For deaths due to collective violence and natural disasters, we used mortality shock regressions. For every cause, we estimated 95% UIs that captured both parameter estimation uncertainty and uncertainty due to model specification where CODEm was used. We constrained cause-specific fractions within every age-sex group to sum to total mortality based on draws from the uncertainty distributions.
   Findings In 2010, there were 52.8 million deaths globally. At the most aggregate level, communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional causes were 24.9% of deaths worldwide in 2010, down from 15.9 million (34.1%) of 46.5 million in 1990. This decrease was largely due to decreases in mortality from diarrhoeal disease (from 2.5 to 1.4 million), lower respiratory infections (from 3.4 to 2.8 million), neonatal disorders (from 3.1 to 2.2 million), measles (from 0.63 to 0.13 million), and tetanus (from 0.27 to 0.06 million). Deaths from HIV/AIDS increased from 0.30 million in 1990 to 1.5 million in 2010, reaching a peak of 1.7 million in 2006. Malaria mortality also rose by an estimated 19.9% since 1990 to 1.17 million deaths in 2010. Tuberculosis killed 1.2 million people in 2010. Deaths from non-communicable diseases rose by just under 8 million between 1990 and 2010, accounting for two of every three deaths (34.5 million) worldwide by 2010. 8 million people died from cancer in 2010, 38% more than two decades ago; of these, 1.5 million (19%) were from trachea, bronchus, and lung cancer. Ischaemic heart disease and stroke collectively killed 12.9 million people in 2010, or one in four deaths worldwide, compared with one in five in 1990; 1.3 million deaths were due to diabetes, twice as many as in 1990. The fraction of global deaths due to injuries (5.1 million deaths) was marginally higher in 2010 (9.6%) compared with two decades earlier (8.8%). This was driven by a 46% rise in deaths worldwide due to road traffic accidents (1.3 million in 2010) and a rise in deaths from falls. Ischaemic heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lower respiratory infections, lung cancer, and HIV/AIDS were the leading causes of death in 2010. Ischaemic heart disease, lower respiratory infections, stroke, diarrhoeal disease, malaria, and HIV/AIDS were the leading causes of years of life lost due to premature mortality (YLLs) in 2010, similar to what was estimated for 1990, except for HIV/AIDS and preterm birth complications. YLLs from lower respiratory infections and diarrhoea decreased by 45-54% since 1990; ischaemic heart disease and stroke YLLs increased by 17-28%. Regional variations in leading causes of death were substantial. Communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional causes still accounted for 76% of premature mortality in sub-Saharan Africa in 2010. Age standardised death rates from some key disorders rose (HIV/AIDS, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease in particular), but for most diseases, death rates fell in the past two decades; including major vascular diseases, COPD, most forms of cancer, liver cirrhosis, and maternal disorders. For other conditions, notably malaria, prostate cancer, and injuries, little change was noted.
   Interpretation Population growth, increased average age of the world's population, and largely decreasing age-specific, sex-specific, and cause-specific death rates combine to drive a broad shift from communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional causes towards non-communicable diseases. Nevertheless, communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional causes remain the dominant causes of YLLs in sub-Saharan Africa. Overlaid on this general pattern of the epidemiological transition, marked regional variation exists in many causes, such as interpersonal violence, suicide, liver cancer, diabetes, cirrhosis, Chagas disease, African trypanosomiasis, melanoma, and others. Regional heterogeneity highlights the importance of sound epidemiological assessments of the causes of death on a regular basis.

TI  - MALARIA CONTROL IN THE GREATER MEKONG SUBREGION: AN OVERVIEW OF THE CURRENT RESPONSE AND ITS LIMITATIONS
T2  - SOUTHEAST ASIAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - The malaria burden in the Greater Mekong Subregion has been dramatically reduced over the last 20 years but the disease remains an important public health issue in all six countries. This chapter introduces the standard tools for malaria control (long lasting insecticidal nets; indoor residual spraying; early diagnosis and appropriate treatment; epidemic surveillance and response; and, communication) and presents the evidence base supporting the use of each of these tools in the Subregion. Targeting approaches and delivery mechanisms for these tools are presented and discussed country by country. The technical limitations of these standard tools and delivery mechanisms are then discussed in the context of local variations in the epidemiology of the disease. The challenges presented by the feeding and resting habits of local vectors, by the characteristics and behavior of different human population groups, and by particular species and drug resistant strains of malaria parasites are considered.
   A range of innovative tools and delivery mechanism that have been developed to address these problems are presented and moves to bring these various innovations together to provide a comprehensive package of malaria control services for each risk group are discussed. Implementation arrangements are introduced and an overview of the stakeholder landscape at regional and country level is provided. Finally, remaining programmatic gaps (which include limited coverage, declining funds, drug resistance, weak surveillance and weak health systems) are highlighted and areas in need of further action (including the need for continued innovation) are discussed.

TI  - <i>Amblyomma testudinarium</i> infestation on a brown bear (<i>Ursus arctos yesoensis</i>) captured in Hokkaido, a northern island of Japan
T2  - PARASITOLOGY INTERNATIONAL
AB  - The tick Amblyomma testudinarium Koch, 1844 (Acari: Ixodidae) is known as a vector of several pathogens such as Rickettsia tamurae and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) virus. This tick species is present in many Asian countries, including Japan, where its distribution is limited to the warm areas of Kanto region and the southwestern region. The present study reports the recovery of a partially engorged A. testudinarium from a wild brown bear captured in Shari town, Hokkaido. In addition to morphological identification, the specimen was genetically characterized by the complete mitochondrial genome sequencing. The results showed that the length of the obtained mitogenome is 14,835 bp that encodes 13 protein-coding, two ribosomal RNA (rRNA) (12S and 16S), and 22 transfer RNA genes with two non-coding control regions. The phylogenetic analysis indicated that our sample clustered with A. testudinarium from Nara, Japan, but separated from A. testudinarium from China. Although the introduction of the tick through livestock transportation cannot be ruled out, the detection of A. testudinarium in Hokkaido prefecture, which is separated from the main island where A. testudinarium is present in the south, may suggest the introduction by migratory birds. This study provides important insights on the distribution and host range of A. testudinarium. This will be useful for the future taxonomic analysis of ticks based on the complete mitogenome sequencing. To our knowledge, this is the northernmost detection point of the tropical tick A. testudinarium.

TI  - Banana Peels: A Waste Treasure for Human Being
T2  - EVIDENCE-BASED COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE
AB  - In recent years, scientists' interest in agricultural waste has increased, and the waste has become attractive to explore and benefit from, rather than being neglected waste. Banana peels have attracted the attention of researchers due to their bioactive chemical components, so we focused on this review article on the antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of banana peels that can be used as good sources of natural antioxidants and for pharmaceutical purposes in treating various diseases. Banana is an edible fruit belonging to the genus Musa (Musaceae), cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions. Banana peels are used as supplementary feed for livestock in their cultivation areas. Its massive by-products are an excellent source of high-value raw materials for other industries by recycling agricultural waste. Hence, the goal is to use banana by-products in various food and nonfood applications and sources of natural bioactive compounds. It can be concluded that banana peel can be successfully used in food, pharmaceutical, and other industries. Therefore, banana residues may provide new avenues and research areas for the future.

TI  - A Stacked Ensemble Deep Learning Approach for Imbalanced Multi-Class Water Quality Index Prediction
T2  - CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA
AB  - A common difficulty in building prediction models with real-world environmental datasets is the skewed distribution of classes. There are significantly more samples for day-to-day classes, while rare events such as polluted classes are uncommon. Consequently, the limited availability of minority outcomes lowers the classifier's overall reliability. This study assesses the capability of machine learning (ML) algorithms in tackling imbalanced water quality data based on the metrics of precision, recall, and F1 score. It intends to balance the misled accuracy towards the majority of data. Hence, 10 ML algorithms of its performance are compared. The classifiers included are AdaBoost, Support Vector Machine, Linear Discriminant Analysis, k-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Extra Trees, Bagging, and the Multilayer Perceptron. This study also uses the Easy Ensemble Classifier, Balanced Bagging, and RUSBoost algorithm to evaluate multi-class imbalanced learning methods. The comparison results revealed that a high-accuracy machine learning model is not always good in recall and sensitivity. This paper's stacked ensemble deep learning (SE-DL) generalization model effectively classifies the water quality index (WQI) based on 23 input variables. The proposed algorithm achieved a remarkable average of 95.69%, 94.96%, 92.92%, and 93.88% for accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, respectively. In addition, the proposed model is compared against two state-of-the-art classifiers, the XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) and Light Gradient Boosting Machine, where performance metrics of balanced accuracy and g-mean are included. The experimental setup concluded XGBoost with a higher balanced accuracy and G-mean. However, the SE-DL model has a better and more balanced performance in the F1 score. The SE-DL model aligns with the goal of this study to ensure the balance between accuracy and completeness for each water quality class. The proposed algorithm is also capable of higher efficiency at a lower computational time against using the standard Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) approach to imbalanced datasets.

TI  - Malaria and <i>Hepatocystis</i> species in wild macaques, Southern Thailand
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Southeast Asian macaques are natural hosts for a number of nonhuman primate malaria parasites; some of these can cause diseases in humans. We conducted a cross-sectional survey by collecting 99 blood samples from Macaca fascicularis in southern Thailand. Giemsa-stained blood films showed five (5.1%) positive samples and six (6.1 %) isolates had positive test results by polymerase chain reaction. A phylogenetic tree inferred from the A-type sequences of the small subunit ribosomal RNA gene confirmed Plasmodium inui in five macaques; one of these macaques was co-infected with P. coatneyi. Hepatocystis, a hemoprotozoan parasite transmitted by Culicoides, was identified in an isolate that was confirmed by analysis of mitochondrial cytochrome b sequences. All malaria-infected monkeys lived in mangrove forests, but no infected monkeys were found in an urban area. These findings indicate regional differences in malaria distribution among these macaques, as well as differences in potential risk of disease transmission to humans.

TI  - Safety evaluation (acute and sub-acute studies) of the aqueous extract of the leaves of <i>Myrianthus arboreus</i> P. Beauv. (Cecropiaceae) in Wistar rats
T2  - JOURNAL OF ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY
AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Myrianthus arboreus P. Beauv (Cecropiaceae) is a medicinal plant distributed in forests and damp places of tropical Africa. Its leaves are widely used as food and/or for the treatment of various ailments including dysmenorrhoea, female infertility, tumors and diarrhea. However, to the best of our knowledge, no safety assessment of this plant has been reported yet.
   Aim of study: The present study aimed at evaluating the safety of the aqueous extract of leaves of Myrianthus arboreus (MAA) in Wistar rats through an acute and sub-acute oral administration.
   Material and methods: In acute oral toxicity, the test was performed according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) guidelines Nr. 423 (acute toxicity class method, ATC) with slight modifications. Female Wistar rats were orally treated with the aqueous extract of M. arboreus at the doses of 2000 and 5000 mg/kg. In sub-acute toxicity study, using the OECD guidelines Nr. 407, the extract was administered by gavage at the doses of 20,110 and 200 mg/kg/day for 28 consecutive days.
   Results: A single oral administration of 2000 or 5000 mg/kg of the extract induced neither mortality nor exterior signs of toxicity indicating a LD50 > 5000 mg/kg. In sub-acute study, the extract decreased triglycerides, total cholesterol/high density lipoproteins ratio and atherogenic index of plasma in both sexes at all tested doses. Alanine transaminase decreased in both sexes at 200 mg/kg and serum creatinine levels decreased at all tested doses in females. Moreover, significant increases in ovarian and uterine wet weights, red blood cell count, hematocrit, mean corpuscular hemoglobin and hemoglobin were observed at 200 mg/kg in females. In males, this extract decreased white blood cell count, lymphocytes and relative weight of seminal vesicles and ventral prostate at 200 mg/kg.
   Conclusion: The aqueous extract of Myrianthus arboreus leaves was non-toxic in acute administration and exhibited a relatively low toxicity potential on accessory sex organs in both sexes, and leukocytes in males following the repeated 28-days oral administration of the dose 200 mg/kg.

TI  - Oil palm mapping using Landsat and PALSAR: a case study in Malaysia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Irrespective of the positive economic benefit or negative environmental impact of the rapid expansion of oil palm plantations in tropical regions, it is important to be able to create accurate land-cover maps for such areas. Optical remote sensing is vulnerable to the effects of clouds, which can limit data availability for the oil palm plantation areas in the humid tropics. The satellite-flown PALSAR (Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar) instrument, which provides all-day/all-weather Earth observations, offers the opportunity to identify and map oil palm plantations in cloudy regions. This study used a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier and a Mahalanobis distance (MD) classifier to undertake supervised classifications of Landsat, PALSAR, and combined Landsat and PALSAR data (Landsat+PALSAR) for two locations in peninsular Malaysia. Results indicate that accuracies from Landsat+PALSAR are better than accuracies from Landsat and PALSAR along for both study areas using both classifiers. The extents of the oil palm areas estimated from these maps were compared with values obtained through human photointerpretation of Google Earth (TM) images in previous studies. Based on the R-2 statistics, it was established that the Landsat+PALSAR combination performed best for both study areas and demonstrated good potential for oil palm plantation mapping.

TI  - Incidence and Severity of End-Splitting in Plantation-Grown <i>Eucalyptus pellita</i> F. Muell. in North Borneo
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Eucalyptus pellita F. Muell. is currently the predominant tree species deployed for tree plantation establishment in some parts of Borneo, particularly Sabah state, Malaysia. Its low disease susceptibility, good growth and form, and desirable wood properties make E. pellita particularly suitable for plantation development in the wet tropical regions of south-east Asia. In spite the many positive traits, practical field observations indicate that the species is susceptible to end-splitting. There is some anecdotal evidence to suggest a genetic relationship with the incidence of end-split, although these observations were not statistically tested. This study evaluates the occurrence of end-splitting in five-year old plantation E. pellita in Sabah as affected by family and growth attributes. An existing progeny tree breeding trial, involving seeds that originated from Papua New Guinea, China, Vietnam, Australia, Sabah, and Sarawak with 106 families, was used to carry out the split assessment. Logs from the second thinning were cut into 2.2-m-long sections. The end splits were measured three days later; the incidence and severity of splitting were assessed at both the large and small ends of each log by using a designated split scoring system. The study shows that 99% of all log cross sections (per cut surface) experienced signs of splitting, with an average of 2.7 splits per cut surface. Overall, 54% of all splits were classed as 'Three-Quarter Radial Splits' while the occurrence of internal splits was negligible. Split severity showed a heritable and significant difference (h(2) = 0.24 at p <= 0.05) among the family levels. Splitting was also significantly related to growth factors such as tree height and diameter at breast height (DBH). The findings suggest that end-splitting is caused by family-environment interactions. This offers the opportunity to improve the wood resource of E. pellita via breeding strategies.

TI  - EPIDEMIOLOGY OF ENCEPHALITIS BY ARBOVIRUSES IN THE AMAZON REGION OF BRAZIL
T2  - REVISTA DO INSTITUTO DE MEDICINA TROPICAL DE SAO PAULO
AB  - An overview of ecological, epidemiological and clinical findings of potential arthropod-borne encephalitis viruses circulating in the Amazon Region of Brazil are discussed. These viruses are the Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE), Western Equine Encephalitis (WEE), St. Louis Encephalitis (SLE), Mucambo (MUC) and Pixuna (PIX). These last two are subtypes (III and IV) of Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis virus.
   The areas of study were the highways and projects of development, as well as places where outbreaks of human diseases caused by arboviruses had been detected. These viruses are widespread in all Amazonia, and at least four of them, EEE, WEE, SLE and MUC are pathogenic to man. EEE and WEE infections were detected by serology, while SLE and MUC by either serology and virus isolation. The PIX virus has the lowest prevalence and, it was isolated in only a few cases, one being from a laboratory infection. Wild birds are the main hosts for all these viruses, except MUC, whose major hosts are rodents.
   The symptoms presented by infected people were generally a mild febrile illness. Although, jaundice was observed in two individuals from whom SLE was isolated. A comparison of the clinical symptoms presented by the patients in the Amazon Region and other areas of America, especially in the USA is made.
   In Brazilian Amazon region epidemics have not been detected although, at least, one EEE epizootic was recorded in Braganca, Para State, in 1960. At that time, of 500 horses that were examined 61% were positive to EEE by HI and of them 8.2% died. On the other hand. SLE has caused four epizootics in a forest near Belem. Wild birds and sentinel monkeys were infected, but no human cases were reported.

TI  - Biocontrol of Postharvest Anthracnose of Mango Fruit with <i>Debaryomyces Nepalensis</i> and Effects on Storage Quality and Postharvest Physiology
T2  - JOURNAL OF FOOD SCIENCE
AB  - Anthracnose is presently recognized as one of the most important postharvest disease of mango worldwide. To control the disease, chemical fungicides for a long time was widely used among fruit farmers, but recently found that pathogen had developed increasingly resistance to it. With people's growing desire of healthy and green food, finding new and environmentally friendly biological control approach was very necessary. In this paper, we provided a kind of new antagonistic yeast which enriched the strainresources and the efficacy of Debaryomyces nepalensis against postharvest anthracnose of mango fruit and the influence on quality parameters were investigated. The results showed that the decay incidence and lesion diameter of postharvest anthracnose of mango treated by D. nepalensis were significantly reduced compared with the control fruit stored at 25 degrees C for 30 d or at 15 degrees C for 40 d, and the higher concentration of D. nepalensis was, the better the efficacy of the biocontrol was. Study also found that 1 h was the best treatment duration and antagonistic yeast inoculated earlier had good biocontrol effect on anthracnose. Meanwhile, treatment by D. nepalensis could significantly reduce postharvest anthracnose of mango, delay the decrease in firmness, TSS, TA, and ascorbic acid value, and do not impair surface color during postharvest storage. Moreover, the increase in MDA (malondialdehyde) content and increase in cell membrane permeability of fruit treated by D. nepalensis was highly inhibited. The results suggested D. nepalensis treatment could not only maintain storage quality of mango fruit, but also decrease the decay incidence to anthracnose disease. All these results indicated that D. nepalensis has great potential for development of commercial formulations to control postharvest pathogens of mango fruit.

TI  - A RAPID MAPPING TECHNIQUE FOR THE PREVALENCE AND DISTRIBUTION OF ONCHOCERCIASIS - A CAMEROON CASE-STUDY
T2  - ANNALS OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND PARASITOLOGY
AB  - A rapid and cheap method for mapping the endemicity levels of onchocerciasis in both forest and savanna areas, where the vectors are members of the Simulium damnosum complex, is described. The selection of the study communities is based on a general understanding of the vectors' ecology and biassed towards those at highest risk of onchocerciasis, although there must be adequate geographical coverage. In a case study in Cameroon, prevalences were determined, using the non-invasive nodule palpation technique, in samples, each of 30-50 adult males, from 49 villages in six study areas in Cameroon. The method proved effective in the rapid mapping of onchocerciasis distribution in all areas studied, in which the distribution patterns varied from the classical linear to diffuse, and in one area with an anomalous distribution. The method should prove of value in the design of national onchocerciasis control programmes.

TI  - Earth system impacts of the European arrival and Great Dying in the Americas after 1492
T2  - QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS
AB  - Human impacts prior to the Industrial Revolution are not well constrained. We investigate whether the decline in global atmospheric CO2 concentration by 7-10 ppm in the late 1500s and early 1600s which globally lowered surface air temperatures by 0.15 degrees C, were generated by natural forcing or were a result of the large-scale depopulation of the Americas after European arrival, subsequent land use change and secondary succession. We quantitatively review the evidence for (i) the pre-Columbian population size, (ii) their per capita land use, (iii) the post-1492 population loss, (iv) the resulting carbon uptake of the abandoned anthropogenic landscapes, and then compare these to potential natural drivers of global carbon declines of 7-10 ppm. From 119 published regional population estimates we calculate a pre-1492 CE population of 60.5 million (interquartile range, IQR 44.8-78.2 million), utilizing 1.04 ha land per capita (IQR 0.98-1.11). European epidemics removed 90% (IQR 87-92%) of the indigenous population over the next century. This resulted in secondary succession of 55.8 Mha (IQR 39.0-78.4 Mha) of abandoned land, sequestering 7.4 Pg C (IQR 4.9-10.8 Pg C), equivalent to a decline in atmospheric CO2 of 3.5 ppm (IQR 2.3-5.1 ppm CO2). Accounting for carbon cycle feedbacks plus LUC outside the Americas gives a total 5 ppm CO2 additional uptake into the land surface in the 1500s compared to the 1400s, 47 -67% of the atmospheric CO2 decline. Furthermore, we show that the global carbon budget of the 1500s cannot be balanced until large-scale vegetation regeneration in the Americas is included. The Great Dying of the Indigenous Peoples of the Americas resulted in a human-driven global impact on the Earth System in the two centuries prior to the Industrial Revolution. (C) 2019 The Authors.

TI  - Assessing climate vulnerabilities and adaptive strategies for resilient beef and dairy operations in the tropics
T2  - CLIMATIC CHANGE
AB  - Cattle ranchers and dairy farmers operating throughout many tropical regions are experiencing major challenges associated with climate change such as higher incidence of heat stress and drought. These effects can result in reduced productivity of rangeland, shortage of nutritional feed, increased heat stress on animals, and high energy costs for cooling. High temperatures and resultant heat stress reduce animal productivity and increase the proliferation and survival of parasites and disease pathogens. Warming reduces the ability of dairy cattle to produce milk and gain weight and can also lower conception rates. This paper reviews research from the Caribbean on heat tolerant traits in bovine and presents evidence that introducing a "slick hair" gene into Holstein cows by crossbreeding with Senepols may increase thermo-tolerance and productivity. As in other parts of the tropics, principal cattle breeds in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands have been largely introduced from temperate regions. Research indicates these animals may be poorly adapted to rising temperatures, leaving them increasingly vulnerable to chronic heat stress and reduced productivity. Adaptive practices have been developed in breeding and pasture management programs including selection for more heat-resistant genotypes, silvopasturing and crop diversification in forage production, and optimizing facilities and practices to reduce heat stress. Given the nature of climate vulnerability, an integrated approach to adaptation will likely have the greatest success in reducing future risk for producers.

TI  - A geographical approach to identify sleeping sickness risk factors in a mangrove ecosystem
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE & INTERNATIONAL HEALTH
AB  - OBJECTIVES To provide a better understanding of sleeping sickness transmission and spread in mangrove areas to optimize its control.
   METHODS In the Forecariah mangrove area, Guinea, 19 sleeping sickness cases and 19 matched controls were followed up in their living areas (at home, in fields and at water points). All occupational sites and pathways were mapped and then placed in their environmental context.
   RESULTS The sleeping sickness cases displayed a significantly broader and more diverse spatial occupation than the controls. They covered double the daily walking distances of controls and had on average two more occupational sites, most of which were located in mangrove forests. Activities with a higher transmission risk (rice culture, attendance of pirogue jetties) were identified as well as high-risk areas and pathways.
   CONCLUSIONS An entomological control strategy targeting transmission risk areas is proposed. Its implementation in a control programme would reduce by 86% the efforts needed for a classical vector control programme throughout the area. Medical surveys set up at specific locations, such as pirogue jetties and high-risk paths, should also enable better targeting of the population at highest risk.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Pseudomonasisolates from tropical environments have been underexplored and may form an untapped reservoir of interesting secondary metabolites. In this study, we comparedPseudomonasand cyclic lipopeptide (CLP) diversity in the rhizosphere of a cocoyam root rot disease (CRRD) suppressive soil in Boteva, Cameroon with those from four conducive soils in Cameroon and Nigeria. Compared with other soils, Boteva andosols were characterized by high silt, organic matter, nitrogen and calcium. Besides, the cocoyam rhizosphere at Boteva was characterized by strains belonging mainly to theP.koreensisandP.putida(sub)groups, with representations in theP.fluorescens,P.chlororaphis,P.jesseniiandP.asplenii(sub)groups. In contrast,P.putidaisolates were prominent in conducive soils. Regarding CLP diversity, Boteva was characterized by strains producing 11 different CLP types with cocoyamide A producers, belonging to theP.koreensisgroup, being the most abundant. However, putisolvin III-V producers were the most dominant in the rhizosphere of conducive soils in both Cameroon and Nigeria. Furthermore, we elucidated the chemical structure of putisolvin derivatives-putisolvin III-V, and described its biosynthetic gene cluster. We show that highPseudomonasand metabolic diversity may be driven by microbial competition, which likely contributes to soil suppressiveness to CRRD.

TI  - A Controlled Trial of Mass Drug Administration to Interrupt Transmission of Multidrug-Resistant Falciparum Malaria in Cambodian Villages
T2  - CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB  - Background. The increase in multidrug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum in Southeast Asia suggests a need for acceleration of malaria elimination. We evaluated the effectiveness and safety of mass drug administration (MDA) to interrupt malaria transmission.
   Methods. Four malaria-endemic villages in western Cambodia were randomized to 3 rounds of MDA (a 3-day course of dihydroartemisinin with piperaquine-phosphate), administered either early in or at the end of the study period. Comprehensive malaria treatment records were collected during 2014-2017. Subclinical parasite prevalence was estimated by ultrasensitive quantitative polymerase chain reaction quarterly over 12 months.
   Results. MDA coverage with at least 1 complete round was 88% (1999/2268), >= 2 rounds 73% (1645/2268), and all 3 rounds 58% (1310/2268). Plasmodium falciparum incidence in intervention and control villages was similar over the 12 months prior to the study: 39 per 1000 person-years (PY) vs 45 per 1000 PY (P=.50). The primary outcome, P. falciparum incidence in the 12 months after MDA, was lower in intervention villages (1.5/1000 PY vs 37.1/1000 PY; incidence rate ratio, 24.5 [95% confidence interval], 3.4-177; P=.002). Following MDA in 2016, there were no clinical falciparum malaria cases over 12 months (0/2044 PY) in all 4 villages. Plasmodium vivax prevalence decreased markedly in intervention villages following MDA but returned to approximately half the baseline prevalence by 12 months. No severe adverse events were attributed to treatment.
   Conclusions. Mass drug administrations achieved high coverage, were safe, and associated with the absence of clinical P. falciparum cases for at least 1 year.

TI  - CLASSIFICATION OF AGARWOOD (GAHARU) BY RESIN CONTENT
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL FOREST SCIENCE
AB  - Agarwood or gaharu is a fragrant resinous heartwood that can develop in diseased trees from the genus Aquilaria (Thymelaeaceae). The wood is often classified into various grades according to the colour, density, gaharu formation and scent. These parameters are very subjective and depend on individual perception. In this study, several grades of gaharu wood from natural sources and inoculated materials were evaluated for resin content and the data classified using Z-score transformation technique. The results demonstrated that resin content could be used as a guide for the classification of gaharu, thus assisting the industry to reduce bias judgement among traders.

TI  - Man-made lakes, ecological studies and conservation needs in Nigeria
T2  - REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL
AB  - The benefit derived from the creation of man-made lakes in Nigeria and other developing countries is usually associated with great risks. Whenever we establish a dam, it appears we dam the inherent consequences to the detriment of man and his environment. Debts were incurred by the countries concerned, man and animals were displaced, arable lands destroyed including degradation of forest and wild life resources. The creation of dams have also ignored the prevention of man and his life stock from the inherent spread of water borne diseases. The purpose for which a dam is created is threatened if man is indiscriminately exposed to the risk of water home diseases. The poor and uneconomic management of the fish resources is also another major issue of concern. In order to tap the full potentials of reservoir projects and to promote conservation, it is important to have a round table talk involving all stake holders during the planning stage of such projects. Therefore apart from the engineering works, there is also need for collaboration with all experts from related fields especially the biologists, sociologists and economists for bio-socio-economic reasons during the planning and implementation stages of dam projects in Nigeria and other developing countries.

TI  - Improving accuracy evaluation of Landsat-8 OLI using image composite and multisource data with Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
AB  - Land use and land cover (LULC) mapping is very important for evaluation and management of natural resources. Classification of remote sensing data in mountainous and other heterogeneous environments are particularly problematic because of their high spectral heterogeneity. The aim of this study is to conduct accuracy analyses of LULC classification of Landsat-8 OLI composite images and multisource ancillary data using four machine learning classifiers on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform in the Golden Gate Highland National Park (GGHNP) and its near surrounding. Our results indicate that the inclusion of short-wave infrared bands increased accuracy of image composites by more than 10% in landcover types with wider range of spectral characteristics. Best performance was achieved by MaxEnt with overall accuracy and kappa statistics of 0.846 and 0.775, respectively. Support Vector Machine (SVM), however, produces relatively higher accuracy for handling different characteristics of multisource data. In elevated areas, aspect was found to outperform other topographic indices in reducing misclassification errors associated with confusion of grasslands with bare lands and water. The LULC produced from image composites can provide some reliable information on vegetation, land and water characteristics and reduce confusion associated with complex biophysical environments on vegetation spectral signatures in sub-tropical mountainous grasslands.

TI  - MALARIA EPIDEMIOLOGY IN THE PROVINCE OF MOYEN-OGOOV, GABON
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND PARASITOLOGY
AB  - In the course of epidemiological and immunological baseline studies parasitological surveys were conducted, in 1992, in three localities situated in our near rain forest in the area of Lambarene, Gabon, western Central Africa. Anopheles gambiae s.s. and A. funestus are considered to be the main vectors of malaria. The three localities represent strata with obvious differences in the intensity of malaria transmission. The lowest parasite rates were recorded in the village around the Albert-Schweitzer-Hospital where environmental sanitation and easy access to diagnostic and therapeutic facilities afford a fair measure of malaria control. The villages of Bellevue and Tchad show a much higher prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum, followed by P. malariae and P. ovale. In all three villages parasite rates and geometric mean parasite densities of P. falciparum showed the age pattern typical for areas with stable, hyperendemic malaria. Analysis by season showed the period of the long rains to be the epidemiologically calmest while the dry season and even more the short rainy season produced an increase of parasite rates and densities. In Tchad, the most affected of the three villages, the parasite rates in female adults were significantly lower than in male adults. This was accompanied by lower parasite densities in female adults.

TI  - Near-infrared-based models for lignin syringyl/guaiacyl ratio of Eucalyptus benthamii and E. pellita using a streamlined thioacidolysis procedure as the reference method
T2  - WOOD SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB  - Lignin syringyl/guaiacyl (S/G) ratio is a key trait in the cellulose pulping industry. Near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy data collected with a bench and a portable instrument were used to develop prediction models for S/G ratio from sawdust samples of 1220 trees of two contrasting Eucalyptus species, namely E. benthamii (n=484), which is a temperate, cold-resistant species, and E. pellita (n=736), which is a heat- and disease-resistant tropical species. For each species, samples were selected based on maximal NIR spectral variation and analyzed for S/G using a streamlined thioacidolysis method with minimal sample input. NIR models were developed for each species separately and jointly. Instead of just using the coefficient of determination (R-2) and the ratio of performance to deviation (RPD), the Spearman's rank correlation (r(s)) and the average of the coefficient of correlation between the references and predicted values (CVRP) were taken into account to evaluate the models. The bench spectrometer had a better performance than the portable instrument (R-2 from 0.77 to 0.86 versus 0.31 to 0.47). Species-specific NIR models were better for E. benthamii (r(s)=0.89, CVRP=2.75%, R-2=0.86 and RPD=1.8), while the joint-species model was better for E. pellita (r(s)=0.97, CVRP=3.98%, R-2=0.82 and RPD=2.1). These NIR models should prove useful for high-throughput wood phenotyping in advanced breeding programs.

TI  - The development of pepper (<i>Piper nigrum</i> L.) foot rot disease on agroforestry
T2  - INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON FOREST CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT (ICFCM) 2019: INNOVATIVE SOLUTION FOR MANAGING TROPICAL FORESTS AND CONSERVING BIODIVERSITY TO SUPPORT SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS
CP  - International Conference on Forest Conservation and Management (ICFCM)
AB  - Pepper foot rot is one of the most destructive diseases. There were three cropping patterns in the research area, i.e., agroforestry, pepper-cocoa and pepper monoculture patterns. As one of the most common cropping patterns, the observation of foot rots in the agroforestry pattern compared to other cropping patterns. The study was conducted in Simbune Village, East Kolaka Regency, Southeast Sulawesi, from October 2013 to September 2014. The research was conducted by direct observation methods. In each cropping pattern, a permanent measurement plot was made by sampling 30% of the total pepper individuals. The intensity of the disease was observed monthly for 12 months. The observation revealed that the intensity of foot rot disease was getting more severe toward the end of observation. The intensity on agroforestry (26% - 33%) and pepper-cocoa (17% - 35%) patterns were lower than that on pepper monoculture pattern (85% - 90%). The infection rate was lowest on the agroforestry pattern with a value of 0.051. This finding suggested that the agroforestry pattern for pepper showed the best resilience against foot rot disease.

TI  - Phylogeographic diversity and hybrid zone of Hantaan orthohantavirus collected in Gangwon Province, Republic of Korea
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background Hantaan orthohantavirus(Hantaan virus, HTNV), harbored byApodemus agrarius(the striped field mouse), causes hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in humans. Viral genome-based surveillance at new expansion sites to identify HFRS risks plays a critical role in tracking the infection source of orthohantavirus outbreak. In the Republic of Korea (ROK), most studies demonstrated the serological prevalence and genetic diversity of orthohantaviruses collected from HFRS patients or rodents in Gyeonggi Province. Gangwon Province is a HFRS-endemic area with a high incidence of patients and prevalence of infected rodents, ROK. However, the continued epidemiology and surveillance of orthohantavirus remain to be investigated. Methodology/Principal findings Whole-genome sequencing of HTNV was accomplished in small mammals collected in Gangwon Province during 2015-2018 by multiplex PCR-based next-generation sequencing. To elucidate the geographic distribution and molecular diversity of viruses, we conducted phylogenetic analyses of HTNV tripartite genomes. We inferred the hybrid zone using cline analysis to estimate the geographic contact between two different HTNV lineages in the ROK. The graph incompatibility based reassortment finder performed reassortment analysis. A total of 12 HTNV genome sequences were completely obtained fromA.agrariusnewly collected in Gangwon Province. The phylogenetic and cline analyses demonstrated the genetic diversity and hybrid zone of HTNV in the ROK. Genetic exchange analysis suggested the possibility of reassortments in Cheorwon-gun, a highly HFRS endemic area. Conclusions/Significance The prevalence and distribution of HTNV in HFRS-endemic areas of Gangwon Province enhanced the phylogeographic map for orthohantavirus outbreak monitoring in ROK. This study revealed the hybrid zone reflecting the genetic diversity and evolutionary dynamics of HTNV circulating in Gangwon Province. The results arise awareness of rodent-borne orthohantavirus diseases for physicians in the endemic area of ROK.
   Author summary The genetic and molecular epidemiological studies on small mammals derived from hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) endemic areas have consistently conducted for the public health surveillance and mitigation of orthohantavirus outbreak in the Republic of Korea (ROK). Implementing viral genome-based surveillance at new expansion sites that may identify HFRS risks is critical for tracking the location of orthohantavirus infections and diagnosing HFRS. In the present study, whole-genome sequences of Hantaan virus (HTNV) from small mammals in Gangwon Province were recovered using multiplex PCR-based next-generation sequencing during 2015-2018. In HFRS-endemic regions including Cheorwon-gun, Chuncheon-si, and Hwacheon-gun, additional HTNV genome sequences contribute to establish a high-resolution phylogeographic map for tracking emerging orthohantavirus-induced diseases. The cline analysis revealed a remarkable hybrid zone by showing spatial contact regions of HTNV at two sites (Cheorwon-gun and Hwacheon-gun) and the spatial separation and sequence divergence across genome segments of HTNV in Gangwon Province. These results demonstrate the genetic diversity and hybrid zone of HTNV circulating in Gangwon Province. These findings increase an awareness raising about HFRS in the endemic area of ROK.

TI  - Population characteristics of howlers: Ecological conditions or group history
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY
AB  - We examined the relative importance of ecological parameters-habitat productivity and seasonality-and group history-episodic predation, disease, and sudden habitat deterioration-to explain variation in the density and group structure of howlers (Alouatta spp.). We use data from a census of Guanocaste National Park, Costa Pica, and a literature review characterizing 80 howler populations. In Guanocaste National Park both habitat type and degree of protection affect howler density and group structure. Howlers were found at the highest density and in the largest groups in areas of semievergreen forest, which ecological sampling indicates have the most consistent level of food production. Differences in density between the sector of the park that first received protected status and more recently protected areas may be due partially to the degree of protection the areas received. We test the prediction that howler density and group structure would be influenced by habitat productivity as indexed by rainfall. Average group size and sex ratios differ among species, but female-to-immature ratios do not. Considering all censuses at one site to be independent, there are significant interspecific differences in density, with Alouatta pigra occurring at lower densities than the other species. In spite of such variability there is no relationship between annual rainfall and howler density and rainfall had a variable effect on group size depending on the level of independence that was considered. While such ecological comparisons are unrefined, e.g., rainfall must be used as a surrogate for habitat production, the fact that so few relationships were documented suggests that factors other than the ecological factors considered here are responsible for the observed differences in population characteristics. We suggest that much of the variability in howler population characteristics is related to events occurring in the recent history of the groups, such as habitat alteration, hunting, food tree crop failure, and disease.

TI  - Paradox, presumption and pitfalls in conservation biology: The importance of habitat change for amphibians and reptiles
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - The recent shift in research attention by amphibian biologists towards the causes of "enigmatic" population declines appears paradoxical given the almost unanimous recognition that habitat change is the primary cause of population declines worldwide. justification for this shift is given by the growing concern associated with more novel stressors, as well as a general presumption that we have a good understanding of the ecological mechanisms that underlie the effects of habitat change. We tested the validity of this presumption by conducting a global scale review of the state of research regarding the consequences of structural habitat change (fragmentation, logging, fire, native regeneration and plantations) for amphibians and reptiles. We reveal a number of serious deficiencies, namely that existing research efforts are characterised by distinct geographic and study biases (e.g. most studies are confined to North America and focus on amphibians), a lack of clear consensus regarding the consequences of many forms of habitat change with many studies reporting seemingly contradictory results, and a number of common limitations in sampling design. The recent shift in research agenda towards the study of more novel stressors, and away from a focus on structural habitat change, cannot therefore be easily explained by differences in our understanding of the threats currently facing amphibians and reptiles. If research priorities are to be dictated by differences in scientific uncertainty then our results suggest that the study of habitat change is deserving of considerably more attention.

TI  - Lasiodiplodia: Generic revision by providing molecular markers, geographical distribution and haplotype diversity
T2  - MYCOSPHERE
AB  - Lasiodiplodia (Botryosphaeriaceae, Botryosphaeriales) has a global distribution and occurs on a wide range of monocotyledonous, dicotyledonous, and gymnospermous hosts. Most Lasiodiplodia species are pathogens that cause various diseases, such as stem cankers, stem and branch gummosis, shoot blight, and fruit rot. In addition, Lasiodiplodia species occur as endophytes and saprobes. This study presents one of the most reliable molecular markers for Lasiodiplodia. The combination of four loci, the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS), the partial translation elongation factor 1-a gene (tef1-a), beta-tubulin (tub2), and RNA polymerase II second largest subunit (rpb2), provided a more reliable resolution for this genus at the species level. Geographical studies showed that Lasiodiplodia species are distributed in tropical and temperate regions, but not in the polar regions. Among its species, L. theobromae has a worldwide distribution on a wide range of hosts, including economically important crops. Combining the morphology and molecular phylogeny is necessary for accurate taxonomic identification of Lasiodiplodia species and is being used in this study. Multigene phylogenetic analyses were performed based on maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference analyses using combined ITS, tef1-a, tub2, and rpb2 sequence data. In addition, the main morphological characteristics of holotype specimens of Lasiodiplodia species are provided. The current study introduced 25 new host and geographical records of saprobic Lasiodiplodia species from Taiwan province, China and Thailand. Based on the herbarium study, two Lasiodiplodia species, L. avicenniarum and L. krabiensis are synonymized under L. brasiliensis. Our analyses revelaed that Lasiodiplodia theobromae as the most common species in this genus, which occurs in a wide range of hosts in tropical and subtropical regions. The present study has led to the expansion of the taxonomic framework of Lasiodiplodia by revealing new host and geographical records. Furthermore, the haplotype networks generated using ITS, tef1-a, tub2, and rpb2 sequence data for 520 isolates of L. theobromae from 44 host families and 35 countries display that none of the L. theobromae isolates grouped according to their host family or country, suggesting that L. theobromae is a less genetically diverse, globally distributed species.

TI  - Antibacterial and Antioxidant Activities of Isolated Compounds from <i>Prosopis africana</i> Leaves
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB  - Prosopis africana (G. &Perr.) Taub (Mimosaceae) is a large tree native to dry tropical Africa and characteristic of dry leguminous forests. Different parts of this plant are used to treat wounds, skin infection, and to fight against cancer. Literature review indicated various pharmacological properties. Despite these medicinal properties, the chemical composition studies remain limited. This study aims to isolate and characterize secondary metabolites from P. africana leaves and evaluate their antibacterial and antioxidant properties. Air-dried powdered leaves of P. africana were macerated in methanol at room temperature and partitioned with ethyl acetate. The EtOAc extract was subjected successively to flash and column chromatographies in order to isolate compounds. The structure of the isolates was determined with help of spectroscopic data including 1D and 2D NMR experiments and comparison with literature data. The antibacterial activities were evaluated via determination of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC). The antioxidant activities were evaluated via gallic acid equivalent antioxidant capacity (GEAC) and diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging assays. The chemical investigation of the EtOAc extract led to the isolation of seven compounds: (2E, 6E) farnesylamine (1), myricetin-3-O-rhamnoside (2), bis(2-ethylhexyl) benzene-1,2-dicarboxylate (3), lupeol (4), ss-sitosterol (5), stigmasterol glycoside (6), and a mixture of bis(2-ethylhexyl) benzene-1,2-dicarboxylate (3) and bis(2-ethylhexyl) benzene-1,4-dicarboxylate (7) in ratio 1 : 2. Compound 1 is described here for the first time as a natural product with complete H-1 and C-13 assignments. Compounds 3 and 7 were identified as artefacts from dichloromethane. Sesquiterpene amine (1) is reported in Prosopis genus for the first time. Antibacterial and antioxidant activities of isolated compounds were investigated. Among the tested samples, the EtOAc extract and compound 2 exhibited the highest antioxidant (EC50 = 5.67-77.56 mu g/mL; GEAC = 36.58-89.28 mu g/mL) and antibacterial (MIC = 8-64 mu g/mL) activities against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. The EtOAc extract and compound 2 from P. africana exhibited antibacterial activity through bacteriolytic effects and reduction of the antioxidant defenses in the bacterial cells. Furthermore, the chemotaxonomic significance of isolated compounds was discussed. The antibacterial and antioxidant activities of ethyl acetate extract and compound 2 can justify the traditional uses of P. africana leaves for the treatment of diseases related to bacterial infections. The presence of compounds 1, 2, and 4 in this plant should also be considered as valuable chemotaxonomic features.

TI  - Association of <i>TLR3</i> single nucleotide polymorphisms with susceptibility to HTLV-1 infection in Iranian asymptomatic blood donors
T2  - REVISTA DA SOCIEDADE BRASILEIRA DE MEDICINA TROPICAL
AB  - Introduction: The human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) has a single-stranded RNA genome and expresses specific proteins that have oncogenic potential. Approximately 15 to 20 million people worldwide have been infected by this virus. Changes in protein or gene expression are the effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) gene. The function and efficacy of signal transduction also lead to modified immune responses. The present study aimed to investigate the association of SNPs within TLR3 (rs3775291 and rs3775296) with susceptibility to HTLV-1 infection in Iranian asymptomatic blood donors. Methods: This study was performed on 100 HTLV-1-infected asymptomatic blood donors and 118 healthy blood donors. Genomic DNA from all participants was purified and then amplified using specific PCR primers. SNPs within TLR3 were evaluated using the restriction fragmentation length polymorphism technique, and the results were analyzed using SPSS software (version 22). Results: The frequencies of the TLR3 (rs3775296) CC, CA, AA genotypes were 70%, 24%, and 6% in the patient group, and 50.8%, 44.9%, and 4.2% in the control group, respectively. There was a significant difference in the frequency distribution of TLR3 (rs3775296) genotypes and alleles, but not in the frequency distribution of TLR3 (rs3775291) genotypes between the patient and control groups. Conclusions: The TLR3 SNP rs3775296 was significantly associated with HTLV-1 infection and may be a protective factor against this viral infection.

TI  - Conidiobolomycosis in a Young Malaysian Woman Showing Chronic Localized Fibrosing Leukocytoclastic Vasculitis: A Case Report and Meta-analysis Focusing on Clinicopathologic and Therapeutic Correlations With Outcome
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF DERMATOPATHOLOGY
CP  - 14th Joint Meeting of International-Society-of-Dermatopathology
AB  - Background: Conidiobolomycosis (also known as rhinoentomophthoramycosis) is a rare cutaneous/mucosal fungal infection seen mainly in the tropical rain forest regions of the world that can be associated with disfiguring facial elephantiasis, and rarely, death.
   Objective: To present an exemplary case report and perform a systematic review of the world's literature to more accurately describe the natural history and the effect of therapy on outcome in conidiobolomycosis.
   Methods: Case report and meta-analysis of published case reports and series of conidiobolomycosis to determine which clinical, pathologic, mycologic, and treatment factors impact on prognosis.
   Results: We document delay in diagnosis of conidiobolomycosis in a young Malaysian woman, whose biopsy showed pathognomonic features-massive tissue eosinophilia and Splendore-Hoeppli phenomenon surrounding broad hyphae. These findings coexisted with granuloma faciale-like changes (fibrosing leukocytoclastic vasculitis) and lymphedema. Treatment with multiple antifungals was followed by complete resolution. For the meta-analysis, pooled data from 199 cases (162 with full outcome data) from 120 reports revealed a similar course for most cases: a disease affecting healthy young adults who present with progressive nasal symptoms (eg, nasal obstruction) and central facial swelling and show improvement or cure after surgical excision and/or treatment with one or more antifungal agents in 83%. Persistent-progressive facial disease occurred in 11%, and 6% died rapidly of fungal infection. Presentation with facial elephantiasis correlated with persistent-progressive rhinoentomophthoramycosis and a longer duration of disease before diagnosis (P = 0.02). Lethal infections were significantly associated with nonstereotypical presentation (eg, orbital cellulitis), visceral infection, absence of the Splendore-Hoeppli phenomenon, presence of comorbidities (eg, immunosuppression, hematolymphoid malignancy), infection with Conidiobolus incongruus or Conidiobolus lamprauges (not Conidiobolus coronatus), lack of response to amphotericin B, and female sex (all P <= 0.002). The few sensitivity studies performed demonstrated in vitro multidrug resistance of Conidiobolus species to most available antifungal agents.
   Limitations: Publication bias, reporting heterogeneity, and data deficits may affect results.
   Conclusions: Conidiobolomycosis should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients who present with nasal symptoms and painless centrofacial swelling. Massive tissue eosinophilia and Splendore-Hoeppli material coating thin-walled hyphae confirms the clinical diagnosis. The granuloma faciale-like histology found in this case can explain the onset of facial lymphedema by fibroinflammatory destruction of lymphatic vessels; the duration of disease and severity of inflammation likely predicts whether the lymphedema is reversible or not. Although rhinoentomophthoramycosis ostensibly responds in vivo to most available antifungal agents, routine culture and susceptibility testing is recommended to better define the efficacy of these therapeutic agents.

TI  - Local-scale variation in malaria infection amongst rural Gambian children estimated by satellite remote sensing
T2  - TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - We investigated local-scale variation in malaria transmission and infection in children within a continuous landscape by retrospective spatial analysis of entomological and clinical data collected during 1988 and 1989 in The Gambia, West Africa. Parasite prevalence was negatively correlated with vector abundance and exposure to malaria parasites in 10 tillages where entomological surveillance had been carried out. Variation in bednet use did not explain this finding. Mosquito-breeding habitat was retrospectively mapped using 20-m spatial resolution multispectral SPOT satellite imagery from 1988. From these data we estimated by linear regression the risk of exposure to malaria parasites in 26 villages where clinical surveys of children had been made. As exposure increased, so did parasite prevalence; but at higher levels of exposure, parasite prevalence declined. Our findings demonstrate marked differences in exposure to malaria in villages over distances of less than 2 km from mosquito breeding sites and suggest that there are also large differences in immunity between neighbouring settlements.

TI  - Novel fungal disease in complex leaf-cutting ant societies
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - 1. The leaf-cutting ants practise an advanced system of mycophagy where they grow a fungus as a food source. As a consequence of parasite threats to their crops, they have evolved a system of morphological, behavioural, and chemical defences, particularly against fungal pathogens (mycopathogens).
   2. Specific fungal diseases of the leaf-cutting ants themselves have not been described, possibly because broad spectrum anti-fungal defences against mycopathogens have reduced their susceptibility to entomopathogens.
   3. Using morphological and molecular tools, the present study documents three rare infection events of Acromyrmex and Atta leaf-cutting ants by Ophiocordyceps fungi, a genus of entomopathogens that is normally highly specific in its host choice.
   4. As leaf-cutting ants have been intensively studied, the absence of prior records of Ophiocordyceps suggests that these infections may be a novel event and that switching from one host to another is possible. To test the likelihood of this hypothesis, host switching was experimentally induced, and successfully achieved, among five distinct genera of ants, one of which was in a different sub-family than the leaf-cutter ants.
   5. Given the substantial differences among the five host ants, the ability of Ophiocordyceps to shift between such distant hosts is remarkable; the results are discussed in the context of ant ecological immunology and fungal invasion strategies.

TI  - Afforestation suppresses <i>Oncomelania hupensis</i> snail density through influencing algae in beaches of the Dongting Lake
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Author summary
   Schistosomiasis is the second largest tropical parasitic disease in the world after malaria. By the end of 2018, the areas in which schistosomiasis is endemic in China are distributed across 12 provinces (municipality and autonomous region). Among these areas, 5 provinces, including Shanghai, Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong and Guangxi, have continued to consolidate achievements in schistosomiasis elimination. Sichuan Province has achieved transmission interruption and 6 provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangxi, Yunnan, Jiangsu have achieved transmission control. Oncomelania hupensis (Snail) is the only intermediate host for the parasite schistosomiasis japonicum, so snail control is an important measure to control the spread of schistosomiasis. So far, the area the snail inhabits in China is 3.63 billion m(2), with more than 95% of this distributed along the beaches of Yangtze River. Forestry schistosomiasis prevention projects has effectively reduced the snail habitat area and decreased snail population density through afforestation of these areas in China. However, the key factors that inhibit snail population growth by afforestation remain unclear. We propose to investigate the interactional relationship between biotic and abiotic factors introduced by afforestation on the distribution of the snail population. The results revealed that the number of soil algae is the important biological element determining snail distribution. Abiotic factors, such as soil properties indirectly impact on the snail population through a direct influence on soil algae. Of these, the pH value, water content, capillary porosity, bulk density interact with the algae content (Chlorophyta, Cyanophyta and Bacillariophyta) to decrease snail density through afforestation.
   Background
   Oncomelania snails serve as the sole intermediate host for Schistosoma japonicum, one of the most important neglected tropical diseases in the world. Afforestation suppression of the Oncomelania hupensis snail has been a long-term effective national strategy to decrease snail density in China. Many previous studies have made clear that vegetation (biotic factors) and soil (abiotic factors) were the basic requirements for snail survival on beaches. Moreover, a lot of research on snail control has been focused on the specific influencing environmental factors for snail survival, such as the vegetation community structure, species composition, diversity index, and the physical and chemical properties of the soil. Most of the existing research has studied the influence of a single factor on snail population density. Conversely, there have been only a few studies focused on the food sources and food composition of the snails. The current research situation on snail control has indicated that the mechanisms underlying ecological snail control have not been systematically characterized. The question of whether biotic or abiotic factors were more important in influencing snail survival remains unclear. Afforestation on beaches has significantly suppressed snail density in China so far. In this study, we proposed that the reduction of snail density was not affected by a single factor but by the interactions of multiple related factors introduced by afforestation. Moreover, different biotic and abiotic factors have significantly different effects on snail control. Therefore the goal of this study was to evaluate the relative importance and interactions of related biotic and abiotic factors on snail density. Methods: Four major vegetation communities: Sedge, Reed, Artificial poplar (3 years of age) and Artificial poplar (5 years of age), on the beaches of the Yangtze River in China were selected for vegetation and snail surveys, as well as for soil sampling. Structural Equation Model (SEM) analysis was used to assess the interactions of biotic and abiotic factors in the context of snail ecology. The soil properties were considered as abiotic factors, while algae of Chlorophyta, Cyanophyta and Bacillariophyta phyla were considered to be biotic factors. In the path analysis, the total effect between the variables was the sum of the direct and indirect effects.
   Results
   The snail density had significant correlations with soil properties, such as water content, bulk density, capillary porosity and pH value, as well as with all three types of soil algae, Chlorophyta, Cyanophyta, and Bacillariophyta. Snail density had a direct negative relationship with capillary porosity and soil bulk density, an indirect negative relationship with soil pH value and an indirect positive relationship with soil water content via soil algae. Meanwhile, as an important food source for the snail, the Chlorophyta, Cyanophyta and Bacillariophyta algae had a significant positive correlation with snail density. High soil pH had a negative impact on Chlorophyta, Bacillariophyta, while soil water content had a positive impact on Chlorophyta, and soil bulk density had a negative impact on Cyanophyta. In addition, the soil pH value and soil bulk density both had negative correlations with soil water content.
   Conclusion
   Afforestation of the beach environment can significantly reduce the snail population density by altering ecological factors. Soil algae (biological factors) might be the key element that drives ecological snail control.
   As important habitat determinants, the impact of the properties of the soil (non-biological factors) on the snail population was largely mediated through soil algae.

TI  - Important questions to progress science and sustainable management of anguillid eels
T2  - FISH AND FISHERIES
AB  - Anguillid eels are found globally in fresh, transitional and saline waters and have played an important role in human life for centuries. The population status of several species is now of significant concern. The threats to populations include direct exploitation at different life stages, blockages to migratory routes by dams and other structures, changes in river basin management that impact habitat carrying capacity and suitability, pollution, climate change, diseases and parasites. While much has been done to understand eel biology and ecology, a major challenge is to identify the key research and management questions so that effective and targeted studies can be designed to inform conservation, management and policy. We gathered 30 experts in the field of eel biology and management to review the current state of knowledge for anguillid eel species and to identify the main topics for research. The identified research topics fell into three themes: (a) Lifecycle and Biology; (b) Impacts and (c) Management. Although tropical anguillid eels are by far the least well understood, significant knowledge gaps exist for all species. Considerable progress has been made in the last 20 years, but the status of many species remains of great concern, particularly for northern temperate species. Without improved engagement and coordination at the regional, national and international level, the situation is unlikely to improve. Further, adaptive management mechanisms to respond to developments in science, policy and our knowledge of potential threats are required to ensure the future of these important and enigmatic species.

TI  - Insights for improving bacterial blight management in coffee field using spatial big data and machine learning
T2  - TROPICAL PLANT PATHOLOGY
AB  - Pseudomonas syringae pv. garcae, the causal agent of coffee disease bacterial blight, causes losses in nurseries and coffee fields. In this work, the objective was to evaluate integrated bacterial blight management in a coffee (Coffea arabica L.) field based on disease spatial pattern and ecological variables. The coffee field was composed by 85 georeferenced sample points, containing 5 plants representing a georeferenced point, being the spatial support of the experiment. Disease intensity classes were predicted in the field by machine learning algorithms fitted to big data on surface reflectance and spectral indices derived from digital image processing of Landsat-8 OLI/TIRS, as well as morphometric and hydrological attributes determined by geocomputation algorithms. Geostatistical modeling was used to characterize the spatial pattern and map the disease to gain epidemiological knowledge and precisely manage bacterial blight. Random forest algorithm enabled to detect the importance of relief morphometry associated with bacterial blight spatial progress in the coffee field, mainly according to the altitude and flow line curvature of the terrain. Probabilistic information on disease spatial pattern, modeled considering external trend effects of the topography variation, can be useful information for disease spatial prediction and integrated management based on georeferenced disease sampling. Multiple environmental variables may be carefully considered to evaluate mechanisms of interactions of bacterial blight with coffee plants and the physical environment.

TI  - Phenotypic Screening of Histone Deacetylase (HDAC) Inhibitors against <i>Schistosoma mansoni</i>
T2  - CHEMMEDCHEM
AB  - Schistosomiasis is a prevalent yet neglected tropical parasitic disease caused by the Schistosoma genus of blood flukes. Praziquantel is the only currently available treatment, hence drug resistance poses a major threat. Recently, histone deacetylase 8 (HDAC8) selective inhibitors have been proposed as a viable treatment for schistosomiasis. Herein, we report the phenotypic screening of a focused library of small molecules of varying HDAC isozyme-inhibition profiles, including eight HDAC8 inhibitors with >10-fold selectivity in comparable functional inhibition assays and IC50 values against HDAC8Schistosoma mansoni newly transformed schistosomula (NTS). Pan-HDAC inhibitors MMH258, MMH259, and MMH373, as assessed by functional inhibition assays, with minimal or no-observed hHDAC8 and SmHDAC8 activities, were active against both NTS (MMH258, IC50=1.5 mu M; MMH259, IC50=2.3 mu M) and adult S. mansoni (MMH258, IC50=2.1 mu M; MMH373, IC50=3.4 mu M). Our results indicate that neither hHDAC8 nor SmHDAC8 activity were directly correlated to their NTS and adult S. mansoni activities.

TI  - An epidemic of sylvatic yellow fever in the southeast region of Maranhao State, Brazil, 1993-1994: Epidemiologic and entomologic findings
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Yellow fever virus transmission was very active in Maranhao State in Brazil in 1993 and 1994. An investigation was carried out to evaluate the magnitude of the epidemic. In 1993, a total of 932 people was examined for yellow fever from Maranhao: 70 were positive serologically, histopathologically, and/or by virus isolation, and another four cases were diagnosed clinically and epidemiologically. In Mirador (17,565 inhabitants), the incidence was 3.5 per 1,000 people (case fatality rate [number of deaths/number of cases diagnosed] = 16.4%), while in a rural yellow fever risk area (14,659 inhabitants), the incidence was 4.2 and the case-fatality rate was 16.1% (10 of 62). A total of 45.2% (28 of 62) asymptomatic infections were registered. In 1994, 49 serum samples were obtained and 16 cases were confirmed (two by virus isolation, two by seroconversion, and 12 by serology). No fatal cases were reported. In 1993, 936 potential yellow fever vectors were captured in Mirador and a single strain was isolated from a pool of Haemagogus janthinomys (infection rate = 0.16%). In 1994, 16 strains were isolated from 1,318 Hg. janthinomys (infection rate = 1.34%) and one Sabethes chloropterus (infection rate = 1.67%). Our results suggest that this was the most extensive outbreak of yellow fever in the last 20 years in Brazil. It is also clear that the lack of vaccination was the principal reason for the epidemic, which occurred between April and June, during the rainy season, a period in which the mosquito population in the forest increases.

TI  - The genome of the sparganosis tapeworm <i>Spirometra</i> <i>erinaceieuropaei</i> isolated from the biopsy of a migrating brain lesion
T2  - GENOME BIOLOGY
AB  - Background: Sparganosis is an infection with a larval Diphyllobothriidea tapeworm. From a rare cerebral case presented at a clinic in the UK, DNA was recovered from a biopsy sample and used to determine the causative species as Spirometra erinaceieuropaei through sequencing of the cox1 gene. From the same DNA, we have produced a draft genome, the first of its kind for this species, and used it to perform a comparative genomics analysis and to investigate known and potential tapeworm drug targets in this tapeworm.
   Results: The 1.26 Gb draft genome of S. erinaceieuropaei is currently the largest reported for any flatworm. Through investigation of beta-tubulin genes, we predict that S. erinaceieuropaei larvae are insensitive to the tapeworm drug albendazole. We find that many putative tapeworm drug targets are also present in S. erinaceieuropaei, allowing possible cross application of new drugs. In comparison to other sequenced tapeworm species we observe expansion of protease classes, and of Kuntiz-type protease inhibitors. Expanded gene families in this tapeworm also include those that are involved in processes that add post-translational diversity to the protein landscape, intracellular transport, transcriptional regulation and detoxification.
   Conclusions: The S. erinaceieuropaei genome begins to give us insight into an order of tapeworms previously uncharacterized at the genome-wide level. From a single clinical case we have begun to sketch a picture of the characteristics of these organisms. Finally, our work represents a significant technological achievement as we present a draft genome sequence of a rare tapeworm, and from a small amount of starting material.

TI  - COW, FARM, AND ECOLOGIC RISK-FACTORS OF CLINICAL VESICULAR STOMATITIS ON COSTA-RICAN DAIRY FARMS
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Twenty-two Costa Rican dairy herds were actively monitored for vesicular diseases between November 1991 and March 1992, in anticipation of the annual dry season occurrence of vesicular stomatitis (VS). Thirty-nine confirmed cases of VS were concentrated on nine farms, resulting in an average herd incidence rate of 11.1% of mature cattle for the affected farms, or 2.6% for all farms. Affected cattle were generally older (average age = 5.4 years), with seven-year-old cows having the highest age-specific incidence rate (6.5%). The New Jersey serotype of VS was diagnosed for all but four cases, primarily manifesting as teat vesicles. Cases had high acute and convalescent antibody titers for both major VS serotypes, New Jersey and Indiana, with significant titer increases after clinical disease. Screening and multiple variable regression analyses of 140 cow, farm, and ecologic variables revealed that clinical disease was significantly associated with cows being in lactation, and with higher acute antibody titers to serotype Indiana, but not with any predisposing diseases. Significant farm factors were the presence of poultry and a longer calving interval on the farm, but not higher rates of other diseases. According to a prior epidemiologic hypothesis, two ecologic factors were forced to be included into the farm model: the reported presence of sand flies, and a higher proportion of the farm being in forest land, with subsequent stepwise regression. The resulting model containing only the two forced variables was significant (P < 0.003) and correctly classified 78% of farms into the correct group, as compared with 79% for the final stepwise model. Study results suggested that the occurrence of clinical VS on a farm was more Likely related to ecologically dependent vector transmission to older lactating animals, rather than to predisposing diseases that may immunocompromise affected animals. This was the first prospective case-control study aimed at finding host and ecologic risk factors associated with an outbreak of clinical VS.

TI  - Geographic variation of notified Ross River virus infections in Queensland, Australia, 1985-1996
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - The spatial and temporal variations of Ross River virus infections reported in Queensland, Australia, between 1985 and 1996 were studied by using the Geographic Information System. The notified cases of Ross River virus infection came from 489 localities between 1985 and 1988, 805 between 1989 and 1992, and 1,157 between 1993 and 1996 (X (2)((df = 2)) = 680.9; P < 0.001). There was a marked increase in the number of localities where the cases were reported by 65 percent for the period of 1989-1992 and 137 percent for 1993-1996, compared with that for 1985-1988. The geographic distribution of the notified Ross River virus cases has expanded in Queensland over recent years. As Ross River virus disease has impacted considerably on tourism and industry, as well as on residents of affected areas, more research is required to explore the causes of the geographic expansion of the notified Ross River virus infections.

TI  - Red List assessment of amphibian species of Ecuador: A multidimensional approach for their conservation
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Ecuador is one of the most biodiverse countries in the world, but faces severe pressures and threats to its natural ecosystems. Numerous species have declined and require to be objectively evaluated and quantified, as a step towards the development of conservation strategies. Herein, we present an updated National Red List Assessment for amphibian species of Ecuador, with one of the most detailed and complete coverages for any Ecuadorian taxonomic group to date. Based on standardized methodologies that integrate taxonomic work, spatial analyses, and ecological niche modeling, we assessed the extinction risk and identified the main threats for all Ecuadorian native amphibians (635 species), using the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria. Our evaluation reveals that 57% (363 species) are categorized as Threatened, 12% (78 species) as Near Threatened, 4% (26 species) as Data Deficient, and 27% (168 species) as Least Concern. Our assessment almost doubles the number of threatened species in comparison with previous evaluations. In addition to habitat loss, the expansion of the agricultural/cattle raising frontier and other anthropogenic threats (roads, human settlements, and mining/oil activities) amplify the incidence of other pressures as relevant predictors of ecological integrity. Potential synergic effects with climate change and emergent diseases (apparently responsible for the sudden declines), had particular importance amongst the threats sustained by Ecuadorian amphibians. Most threatened species are distributed in montane forests and paramo habitats of the Andes, with nearly 10% of them occurring outside the National System of Protected Areas of the Ecuadorian government. Based on our results, we recommend the following actions: (i) An increase of the National System of Protected Areas to include threatened species. (ii) Supporting the ex/in-situ conservation programs to protect species considered like Critically Endangered and Endangered. (iii) Focalizing research efforts towards the description of new species, as well as species currently categorized as Data Deficient (DD) that may turn out to be threatened. The implementation of the described actions is challenging, but urgent, given the current conservation crisis faced by amphibians.

TI  - Association of phytopathogenic bacteria with top-dying disease of sundri tree (Heritiera fomes) in Bangladesh
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED BOTANY-ANGEWANDTE BOTANIK
CP  - Symposium on Useful Tropical Plants
AB  - A novel plant disease called "sundri top-dying" has occurred in the mangrove belt of Bangladesh at the Bay of Bengal, which represents the largest mangrove ecosystem of the world. The disease is causing serious losses of the leading species of this delicate ecosystem, the sundri tree (Heritiera fomes). In order to study the presence of putative biotic disease agents, samples of wood, bark, and leaves were collected from affected and non-affected trees during an inspection trip to this area (the "Sundarbans") in January 1997. From surface-sterilized cuts of the plant specimens bacterial cultures were isolated and injected into tomato plants for bioassay. With bacterial isolates from top-dying affected sundri trees, severe disease symptoms were obtained on the indicator plants. The bacterial isolates were further investigated in a PCR-assay with two primers specific for highly conserved sequence regions in the bacterial 16S rDNA-gene, and sequenced. The authors could identify two different bacterial species due to their sequence homologies. These bacteria, found in samples from affected trees only, exhibited significant homology to either Arthrobacter nicotianae or Pseudomonas sp., both representing bacterial genera containing many phytopathogenic species.

TI  - Climate change manifestations and adaptations in cocoa farms: Perspectives of smallholder farmers in the Adansi South District, Ghana
T2  - CURRENT RESEARCH IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Climate change can have huge consequences for cocoa farming and the livelihoods of communities in tropical Africa, although evidence of such effects is scanty. This study evaluated the perceptions of smallholder cocoa farmers on climate change manifestations and adaptations in the Adansi South District, Ghana. The study involved a survey of 150 households and three focus group discussions from three communities in the district. The Mann-Kendall trend test was used to evaluate the rainfall and temperature trends for the period 1981-2019. The weighted average index (WAI) was used to determine the farmers' perception of climate change, its physical manifestation on their cocoa farms, and adaptation practices. While the district's temperature varied consider-ably from 1981 to 2019, only a marginal increase in annual rainfall was observed. The farmers correctly perceived the changes in climate (WAI = 2.07), evidenced by changes in rainfall patterns (1.76), frequent bushfires (1.68), and increasing intensity of the sun (1.65). Physical manifestations of these changes included increased dieback of cocoa trees (1.77), diseases and pest infestation (1.75), decreased yields (1.69), and stunted growth (1.65). Adaptation measures included early planting of cocoa seeds (1.87), intercropping (1.70), mulching (1.65), planting of drought-resistant varieties (1.64), and crop diversification (1.63). The adaptation measures were influenced by gender, age, education, and farming experience, among other socioeconomic factors. The findings suggest the need for relevant policies to educate cocoa farmers on the effects of climate change, highlighting the risks and benefits, and prioritizing key adaptation options for sustainable cocoa pro-duction in Ghana.

TI  - Sandfly fauna (Diptera: Psychodidae) in an urban area, Central-West of Brazil
T2  - REVISTA DO INSTITUTO DE MEDICINA TROPICAL DE SAO PAULO
AB  - Biological and ecological relations among vectors and their pathogens are important to understand the epidemiology of vector-borne diseases. Camapua is an endemic area for visceral and tegumentary leishmaniasis. The aim of this study was to characterize the sandfly fauna present in Camapua, MS, Brazil. Sand flies were collected every fortnight from May 2014 to April 2015 using automatic light traps in the domicile and peridomicile of twelve neighborhoods and forest. The collected specimens were identified based on morphology according to the valid identification keys. In total, 2005 sandflies of five genera and nine species were collected. Nyssomyia whitmani and Lutzomyia cruzi were the most abundant species. Males were more abundant, with a male-to-female ratio of 2.14. The highest diversity was observed in peripheral neighborhood, with abundant plant cover. The peridomicile presented greater abundance of sandflies, with the predominance of Ny. whitmani. No significant correlation between the absolute frequencies of the most abundant species and the precipitation variable was observed; however, there was a predominance of Lu. cruzi in the rainy season. We observed a high frequency of sandflies in urban area, especially vector species. The presence of Nyssomyia whitmani and Lutzomyia cruzi indicate the necessity for health surveillance in the municipality. Additional method of collection such as sticky trap is also recommended for appropriate faunestic study.

TI  - A multivariate conditional model for streamflow prediction and spatial precipitation refinement
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
AB  - The effective prediction and estimation of hydrometeorological variables are important for water resources planning and management. In this study, we propose a multivariate conditional model for streamflow prediction and the refinement of spatial precipitation estimates. This model consists of high dimensional vine copulas, conditional bivariate copula simulations, and a quantile-copula function. The vine copula is employed because of its flexibility in modeling the high dimensional joint distribution of multivariate data by building a hierarchy of conditional bivariate copulas. We investigate two cases to evaluate the performance and applicability of the proposed approach. In the first case, we generate one month ahead streamflow forecasts that incorporate multiple predictors including antecedent precipitation and streamflow records in a basin located in South China. The prediction accuracy of the vine-based model is compared with that of traditional data-driven models such as the support vector regression (SVR) and the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). The results indicate that the proposed model produces more skillful forecasts than SVR and ANFIS. Moreover, this probabilistic model yields additional information concerning the predictive uncertainty. The second case involves refining spatial precipitation estimates derived from the tropical rainfall measuring mission precipitationproduct for the Yangtze River basin by incorporating remotely sensed soil moisture data and the observed precipitation from meteorological gauges over the basin. The validation results indicate that the proposed model successfully refines the spatial precipitation estimates. Although this model is tested for specific cases, it can be extended to other hydrometeorological variables for predictions and spatial estimations.

TI  - Sand fly captures with Disney traps in area of occurrence of <i>Leishmania</i> (<i>Leishmania</i>) <i>amazonensis</i> in the State of Mato Grosso do Sul, mid-western Brazil
T2  - REVISTA DA SOCIEDADE BRASILEIRA DE MEDICINA TROPICAL
AB  - Introduction: The work was conducted to study phlebotomine fauna (Diptera: Psychodidae) and aspects of American cutaneous leishmaniasis transmission in a forested area where Leishmania (Leishmania) amazonensis occurs, situated in the municipality of Bela Vista, State of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. Methods: The captures were conducted with modified Disney traps, using hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) as bait, from May 2004 to January 2006. Results: Ten species of phlebotomine sandflies were captured: Brumptomyia avellari, Brumptomyia brumpti, Bichromomyia flaviscutellata, Evandromyia bourrouli, Evandromyia lenti, Lutzomyia longipalpis, Psathyromyia campograndensis, Psathyromyia punctigeniculata, Psathyromyia shannoni and Sciopemyia sordellii. The two predominant species were Ev bourrouli (57.3%) and Bi flaviscutellata (41.4%), present at all sampling sites. Two of the 36 hamsters used as bait presented natural infection with Leishmania. The parasite was identified as Leishmania (Leishmania) amazonensis. Conclusions: Analysis of the results revealed the efficiency of Disney traps for capturing Bichromomyia flaviscutellata and the simultaneous presence of both vector and the Leishmania species transmitted by the same can be considered a predictive factor of the occurrence of leishmaniasis outbreaks for the human population that occupies the location.

TI  - TWO NEW <i>TRYPANOSOMA</i> SPECIES FROM AFRICAN BIRDS, WITH NOTES ON THE TAXONOMY OF AVIAN TRYPANOSOMES
T2  - JOURNAL OF PARASITOLOGY
AB  - Trypanosoma anguiformis n. sp. and Trypanosoma polygranularis n. sp. are described from the African olive sunbird, Cyanomitra olivacea, and Latham's forest francolin, Francolinus lathami, respectively, based on the morphology of their hematozoic trypomastigotes and partial sequences of the small subunit ribosomal RNA gene. Both new species belong to the group of small non-striated avian trypanosomes (<30 mu m in length on average) with the kinetoplast situated close to the posterior end of the body. Trypanosoma anguiformis can be readily distinguished from other small avian trypanosomes due to its markedly attenuated (snake-shaped) form of the hematozoic trypomastigotes and the dumbbell-shaped nucleus of the parasite. Trypanosoma polygranularis is readily distinguishable due to the markedly off-center (anteriorly) located nucleus, numerous azurophilic granules that are arranged in a line following the undulating membrane, and the large kinetoplast (with an area up to 1.7 mu m(2) [1.1 mu m(2) on average]). Illustrations of hematozoic trypomastigotes of the new species are given, and DNA lineages associated with these parasites are reported. The current situation in species taxonomy of avian trypanosomes is discussed. We call for the redescription of valid species of avian trypanosomes from their type vertebrate hosts and type localities by using morphological and polymerase chain reaction-based techniques as an initial essential step towards revising the species composition of avian trypanosomes and reconstructing the taxonomy of these organisms.

TI  - DEVELOPMENT OF AN EFFICIENT MICROPROPAGATION PROTOCOL FOR EUCALYPTUS HYBRID (E. UROPHYLLA<i> x</i><i> E.</i><i> GRANDIS)</i> THROUGH AXILLARY SHOOT PROLIFERATION
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL FOREST SCIENCE
AB  - Eucalypts, in the family of Myrtaceae, are a fast-growing timber able to adapt to marginal environments. In Malaysia, the Eucalyptus hybrid (E. urophylla x E. grandis) is becoming popular for plantation as it is more tolerant to disease and produces a straight bole. Micropropagation of axillary shoots from a healthy Eucalyptus hybrid mother tree was evaluated for shoot proliferation in Murashige and Skoog (MS) basal media and woody plant media (WPM), supplemented with 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 mg L-1 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP), singly or in combination with 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mg L-1 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA). The WPM and MS basal media supplemented with 0.1 mg L-1 BAP were found suitable for shoot multiplication as both media induced the production of new shoots and shoot elongation. Higher concentration of BAP and NAA produced stunted axillary shoots. Regenerated shoots were evaluated for root growth in half strength MS basal media supplemented with indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) or NAA at concentrations 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 mg L-1. Root produced and root lengths were not significantly different among media formulation, and it was observed that 0.5 mg L-1 IBA in 1/2 MS basal medium gave the best overall root production. Healthy regenerated plantlets were acclimatised in a weaning chamber for one month, and then planted in polybags filled with baked soil and peat moss (1:1). The plantlets were watered twice a day and kept under 50% shade in the nursery until ready to be transplanted into open field.

TI  - Novel mechanism of distance-oriented bee movement, secondary pollen dispersal and reticulate pollination -: a case study in <i>Melipona panamica</i>
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
AB  - The efficiency of secondary pollen dispersal, effect of distance isolation, and possible consequence of reticulate pollination were assessed specifically by movements of stingless bees (Melipona panamica) in lowland Neotropical forest vegetation in Panama, because this insect is one of the predominant pollen vectors there. The trial consisted of two identical strips (9 m X 45 m) along the forest ground-level discrete vegetation having herbaceous diversity. The design was a 'V', truncated in such a way that the zone, without any vegetation, between the two strips varied from 4.5 to 18 m in width. A nest of M. panamica colony was placed at 12 m from the top of the 'V'. Three equal sectors (135 m(2)) were identified in each strip. The bees were marked with different colours according to each sector of one strip, named the donor strip. Almost all bees were marked until their number was nearly balanced between the three sectors. Then, marked and unmarked bees were counted on the donor and recipient strips. Results showed that the foraging area in a given strip is about 405 m(2) and that a mean proportion of 3.45% of marked bees/total number of bees in colony was recovered in the recipient strip. It was found that a barren zone from 4.5 to 18 m in width was not sufficient to completely discourage bees from crossing between two identical resources, but that it significantly reduced cross-pollination. The bees dispersed pollens by bee-bee interactions within the nest, showing high diversity of pollens from outgoing bees, rather than incoming ones. The pollen viability study along the body of exiting bees showed that the pollens remained viable (48-51 %) within the bee nest, indicating a possibility of out-crossing by exiting bees at the time of their forage patch and trip change.

TI  - Cytogenetic and PCR-based identification of <i>S-damnosum</i> 'Nkusi J' as the anthropophilic blackfly in the Uluguru onchocerciasis focus in Tanzania
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE & INTERNATIONAL HEALTH
AB  - A combined molecular and cytogenetic analysis was used to identify the local blackfly vectors of onchocerciasis in the Uluguru Mts. focus, Morogoro region, central Tanzania. Cytotaxonomic identification revealed the occurrence of three cytospecies of the Simulium damnosum complex, along altitudinal gradients. The cytoform 'Nkusi' was found breeding at low to mid-altitudes (100-500 m), while S. kilibanum was found at mid- and high altitudes (300-1260 m), being sympatric with 'Sebwe' only in the highlands. The analyses further revealed the cytoform 'Nkusi' from the nearby Kilosa focus. Simulium kilibanum and 'Nkusi' are potential vectors of onchocerciasis, while the 'Sebwe' form is considered non-anthropophilic and therefore not a vector. By means of molecular typing of wild-caught females, 'Nkusi' was incriminated as the man-biting fly at all catching sites, and consequently, is the assumed vector of onchocerciasis over the full altitude range. In the high altitude zones, however, S. neavei group species may act as secondary vectors at the edge of the forest reserve, if transmission actually occurs there at all. Our results also suggest that vector control could be feasible because of the vector species breeding in the foothills below 500 m in relatively accessible open country.

TI  - Evaluation of Commercial Rapid Lateral Flow Tests, Alone or in Combination, for SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Testing
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Antibody tests can be tools for detecting current or past severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 [coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)]) infections. Independent test evaluations are needed to document the performance with different sample sets. We evaluated six lateral flow assays (LFAs) and two laboratory-based tests (EUROIMMUN-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA and Abbott-Architect-SARS-CoV-2-IgG). We tested 210 plasma samples from 89 patients diagnosed with acute COVID-19. These samples were collected at different time points after the onset of symptoms. In addition, 80 convalescent plasma samples, and 168 pre-pandemic samples collected from adults in the United States and in Africa were tested. LFA performance varied widely, and some tests with high sensitivity had low specificity. LFA sensitivities were low (18.8-40.6%) for samples collected 0 to 3 days after symptom onset, and were greater (80.3-96.4%) for samples collected . 14 days after symptom onset. These results are similar to those obtained by ELISA (15.6% and 89.1%) and chemiluminescent microparticle assay (21.4% and 93.1%). The range of test specificity was between 82.7% and 97%. The combined use of two LFAs can increase specificity to more than 99% without a major loss of sensitivity. Because of suboptimal sensitivity with early COVID-19 samples and background reactivity with some pre-pandemic samples, none of the evaluated tests alone is reliable enough for definitive diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. However, antibody testing may be useful for assessing the status of the epidemic or vaccination campaign. Some of the LFAs had sensitivities and specificities that were comparable to those of more expensive laboratory tests, and these may be useful for seroprevalence surveys in resource-limited settings.

TI  - Screening Corymbia populations for resistance to Puccinia psidii
T2  - PLANT PATHOLOGY
AB  - The exotic rust pathogen Puccinia psidii is now widespread along the east coast of Australia from temperate Victoria to tropical far north Queensland, with a current host range exceeding 200 species from 37 myrtaceous genera. To determine the threat P.psidii poses to plantation and native eucalypts, artificial inoculation was used to screen germplasm of spotted gum (Corymbia spp.) for resistance to the biotype of P.psidii that has become established in Australia. The objective was to characterize resistance to P.psidii within the Corymbia species complex so that management strategies for the deployment of germplasm from existing breeding programmes of these spotted gum species could be developed. Symptom development initiated 7days after inoculation, with resistant and susceptible seedlings identified within all species, provenances and families. Inter- and intraspecific variability in rust resistance was observed among spotted gum species. There was no apparent relationship between climatic conditions at the provenance origin and disease resistance. The heritability estimates for all assessments are moderate to high and indicate a significant level of additive genetic variance for rust resistance within the populations. The results of this study clearly identify potential to select for resistance at the family level within the tested populations. While the potential for P.psidii to detrimentally impact upon Corymbia in the nursery and in young plantations was demonstrated, estimations of the heritability of resistance suggest that efforts to enhance this trait through breeding have reasonable prospects for success.

In February 1998 (dry season), 28.6% of 126 villagers were infected with malaria, and in September 1998 (rainy season), 16.3% of 147 villagers. The prevalence of malaria infection was consistently high in children under 10, and the predominant malaria species was Plasmodium falciparum. In brief surveys of the mosquitoes performed on the same day as the malaria surveys, 2007 Anopheles females from 12 species were collected by means of human bait, animal bait and resting collections. Of the vector species known to be important in transmitting malaria in neighbouring Thailand - An. minimus, An. dirus, and An. maculatus groups - only An. minimus was found. Its density was, however, very low in both seasons and it was therefore unlikely to be the vector. In fact, An. nivipes accounted for more than 65% of all mosquitoes collected and was the most common species collected from human baits. The results of this study show that endemic areas of malaria in Lao PDR are not necessarily related to forest. Rather, An. nivipes is suspected to be the most important vector.

TI  - Exploratory spatial analysis of social and environmental factors associated with the incidence of Ross River virus in Brisbane, Australia
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - We used geographic information systems and a spatial analysis approach to explore the pattern of Ross River virus (RRV) incidence in Brisbane, Australia. Climate, vegetation and socioeconomic data in 2001 were obtained from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, the Brisbane City Council and the Australian Bureau of Statistics, respectively. Information on the RRV cases was obtained from the Queensland Department of Health. Spatial and multiple negative binomial regression models were used to identify the socioeconomic and environmental determinants of RRV transmission. The results show that RRV activity was primarily concentrated in the northeastern, northwestern, and southeastern regions in Brisbane. Multiple negative binomial regression models showed that the spatial pattern of RRV disease in Brisbane seemed to be determined by a combination of local ecologic, socioeconomic, and environmental factors.

TI  - Phylogeny and taxonomy of <i>Rhytisma</i>-like species worldwide
T2  - FUNGAL DIVERSITY
AB  - Rhytisma Fr. is the type genus of Rhytismataceae (Rhytismatales, Leotiomycetes, Ascomycota). Rhytisma-like species include members of Cryptomyces, Rhytisma and Vladracula. They are parasites on leaves of broadleaf trees and cause tar spot diseases. In this study, a phylogeny based on the large subunit of the ribosomal rRNA gene (nrLSU) and the mitochondrial small subunit (mtSSU) is presented, including sequences of 39 newly collected specimens from East Asia, Europe, and temperate as well as tropical America. Based on analyses of morphology, phylogeny as well as host-specificity and diversification time estimates, the family Rhytismataceae sensu stricto is proposed, and eight genera are accepted in this narrow family, including four novel genera (Densorhytisma, Fanglania, Johnstoniella and Shiqia), the type genus Rhytisma, and the reinstated genera Lophodermina, Placuntium and Xyloma. Lophodermina clusters within the main Rhytisma clade in our analyses, but is divergent in morphological terms, not having large compound stromata. Thirty species are recognized, including seven novel species (Fanglania hubeiensis, F. parasitica, Johnstoniella yunnanensis, Rhytisma japonicum, Rh. taiwanense, Xyloma globosum, and X. shennongjiaense), fifteen new combinations (Densorhytisma anhuiense, D. huangshanense, F. concova, F. himalensis, F. ilicis-integrae, F. ilicis-latifoliae, F. ilicis-pedunculosae, J. lonicerae, Rh. annuliforme, Shiqia menziesii, S. yuexiensis, X. filamentosum, X. maximum, X. muelleri, and X. polare), one new name (J. xylostei), seven known species (Lophodermina melaleuca, Placuntium andromedae, Rhytisma acerinum, Rh. americanum, Rh. punctatum, X. salicinum, and X. umbonatum). In addition, seven immature specimens were studied but not assigned to existing species, herein referred to as Fanglania sp. 1, Johnstoniella sp. 1, Johnstoniella sp. 2, Placuntium sp. 1, Placuntium sp. 2, Rhytisma sp. 1, and Xyloma sp. 1. The systematic positions of Cryptomyces maximus, Cr. muelleri and Vladracula annuliformis are re-assigned based on phylogenetic analysis. One Rhytisma-like species from tropical America was segregated from Rhytismataceae s.str., thus a novel genus Neorhytisma was established to accommodate this species, with the one new combinations Neorhytisma panamense. The results of the molecular phylogenetic analysis indicate that Rhytisma-like species are host-specific at genus level. Apparently, Rhytisma-like species coevolved with their hosts, and Rhytisma-like species on Ericaceae seem to be in the process of host jumping. Morphological characteristics of ascomata are important for the delimitation of species and genera of Rhytisma-like species. This study provides a key to genera and species of recognized Rhytisma-like species worldwide.

TI  - Descriptive epidemiology of lymphatic filariasis in Ghana
T2  - TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - A national filariasis survey was conducted to determine the prevalence and distribution of Wuchereria, bancrofti microfilaraemia and clinical disease associated with lymphatic filariasis in Ghana. Multi-stage systematic sampling was used to select households to be examined in all 10 administrative regions of the country. The results showed a high prevalence of microfilaraemia and disease with considerable regional variation in all the quantities investigated. In general, the disease was more prevalent in the northern guinea savannah and the southern coastal savannah, while the middle forest belt was relatively free. Even within the regions, there was considerable variation in the distribution of the disease. The disease is of potentially major public health significance, particularly in the northern and coastal savannahs, and requires the design and implementation of a control programme.

TI  - Predicting Potential Risk Areas of Human Plague for the Western Usambara Mountains, Lushoto District, Tanzania
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - A natural focus of plague exists in the Western Usambara Mountains of Tanzania. Despite intense research, questions remain as to why and how plague emerges repeatedly in the same suite of villages. We used human plague incidence data for 1986-2003 in an ecological-niche modeling framework to explore the geographic distribution and ecology of human plague. Our analyses indicate that plague Occurrence is related directly to landscape-scale environmental features, yielding a predictive understanding of one set of environmental factors affecting plague transmission in East Africa. Although many environmental variables contribute significantly to these models, the most important are elevation and Enhanced Vegetation Index derivatives. Projections of these models across broader regions predict only 15.5% (under a majority-rule threshold) or 31,997 km(2) of East Africa as suitable for plague transmission, but they successfully anticipate most known foci in the region, making possible the development of a risk map of plague.

TI  - A review of principles for sustainable pest management in rice
T2  - CROP PROTECTION
AB  - This review addresses four principles on which sustainable pest management in rice is to be grounded. The goal of modern pest management is to contribute to agricultural sustainability, with its different facets (food security, balanced relations between man-made and natural ecosystems, conservation of ecosystem services). The four principles are considered in turn within the classic Human - Pest - Environment - Crop framework. Biodiversity, as a first principle, is fundamental to the functioning of food webs. The second principle, host plant resistance (HPR), is a pro-poor, and an often highly efficient element that critically contributes to sustainable crop protection. HPR needs to account for the other principles in its implementation in order to sustain durable resistances over time and space. The third principle, landscape ecology, encompasses inter-linked levels of spatial hierarchies governing the performance of systems (pests, host plants, plant genotypic make-ups, plant and crop physiology, trophic chains, and the physical environment). The fourth principle, hierarchies, concerns the different levels of hierarchy in a landscape, from biological to social. This principle concerns the very fabric of human societies, which involve perceptions, knowledge, and attitudes, which translate into decision-making at several scales, from the individual farmer to policy-makers. This principle thus addresses psychological, policy, and decision-making dimensions.
   In this review, all organisms that may be harmful to rice are referred to as 'pests', including pathogens and animal pests. We do not address all rice pests, but proceed through a few key examples, nor do we enter into the specifics of pest management strategies covering the range of rice production situations. This is because of the very large range of rice pests, of the corresponding diversity of rice production situations worldwide, of the unprecedented rate of diversification of rice production in response to environmental, climatic, social, and economic drivers, and lastly because plant protection in rice faces emerging crop health challenges that continually call for new solutions in new contexts. The review shows that the considered framework - Human - Pest - Environment - Crop - applies, with each of its summits having a different bearing depending on the pest considered. The review further underlines the need for basic research across a range of disciplines, with novel approaches and methods, as well as the need for connecting hierarchy levels, from farmers, to consumers, to societies, the environment, and to policies.

TI  - Allicin Induces Calcium and Mitochondrial Dysregulation Causing Necrotic Death in <i>Leishmania</i>
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   Allicin has shown antileishmanial activity in vitro and in vivo. However the mechanism of action underlying its antiproliferative effect against Leishmania has been virtually unexplored. In this paper, we present the results obtained in L. infantum and a mechanistic basis is proposed.
   Methodology/Principal Finding
   Exposure of the parasites to allicin led to high Ca2+ levels and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential, reduced production of ATP and elevation of cytosolic ROS. The incubation of the promastigotes with SYTOX Green revealed that decrease of ATP was not associated with plasma membrane permeabilization. Annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) staining indicated that allicin did not induce phospholipids exposure on the plasma membrane. Moreover, DNA agarose gel electrophoresis and TUNEL analysis demonstrated that allicin did not provoke DNA fragmentation. Analysis of the cell cycle with PI staining showed that allicin induced cell cycle arrest in the G(2)/M phase.
   Conclusions/Significance
   We conclude that allicin induces dysregulation of calcium homeostasis and oxidative stress, uncontrolled by the antioxidant defense of the cell, which leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and a bioenergetic catastrophe leading to cell necrosis and cell cycle arrest in the premitotic phase.

TI  - <i>Trypanosoma</i> <i>cruzi</i> in the sylvatic environment:: distinct transmission cycles involving two sympatric marsupials
T2  - TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Thirty-ftve specimens of Phiander frenata and 36 Didelphis marsupialis were captured in the same Atlantic forest area of Brazil between 1992 and 1994. Haemocultures showed that 50% of P. frenata and 60% of D. marsupialis were infected with Trypansoma cruzi. Biological, biochemical and molecular characterization of the isolates suggested 2 distinct transmission cycles of T. cruzi occurred between these 2 sympatric didelphids. The T. cruzi isolates could be distinguished according to their association with each marsupial species. Biochemical characterization (multilocus enzyme electrophoresis) revealed 15 zymodemes; more variability was observed among the P. frenata isolates than among the isolates from D. marsupialis. The course of natural and experimental infection in D. marsupialis and P. frenata was different and suggested that D. marsupialis was more resistant to infection than P. frenata. In the studied area, P. frenata seems to be a more important reservoir of T. cruzi than D. marsupialis, since 40% of the characterized isolates from P. frenata belonged to the T. cruzi II group, which is associated with human infections.

TI  - Zika threatens to become a huge worldwide pandemic
T2  - ASIAN PACIFIC JOURNAL OF TROPICAL BIOMEDICINE
AB  - The Aedes aegypti mosquito which transmits Zika virus (as well as dengue, chikungunya and yellow fever) represents a high risk for global transmission. This virus comes from Africa, the Zika forest in Uganda, where it was discovered in 1947 in a rhesus monkey. In May 2015, the first local cases were recorded in Brazil, surpassing 1.5 million cases in December of the same year. By March 2016, local transmission of Zika was recognized in 34 countries. Its clinical condition is similar to dengue febrile illness, although milder. The final geographical distribution area is constantly expanding. Recently, it has been associated with cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome in Brazil, Colombia, El Salvador, Venezuela and Suriname. Microcephaly was documented in Brazil. This article discusses some factors that contributed to the spread of Zika virus in South America. Climate change associated with the events of the phenomenon of "El Nino" is also analyzed. The biggest concern is how quickly Zika is spreading around the world and that it could be far more dangerous than previously thought. Zika virus infection, by its explosive potential, has every chance of becoming a global pandemic.

TI  - Testing of two microsporidia isolates towards breeds of silkworm resistance
T2  - 1ST BIENNIAL CONFERENCE ON TROPICAL BIODIVERSITY
CP  - 1st Biennial Conference of Tropical Biodiversity (BCTB)
AB  - Pebrine disease is a significant disease attacking silkworm (Bombyx mori L.) caused by microsporidia (Nosema bombycis Nageli). This research aims to test breeds of silkworm that are resistant to pebrine disease. Microsporidia are isolated from local seeds (PL-614) and imported seeds (PC-614). The resistance of four breeds of the silkworm is tested by applying the topical method to mulberry leaves sized 3x4 cm(2) for the third instar larvae and 5x7 cm(2) for the fourth instar larvae. Each spore concentration of microsporid isolates used is 1x10(5) per ml. The research result shows that breeds of new seeds, namely SS01, SS02, and SS03 are resistant to infection of the two isolates. This research is useful as a reference for the regional or central government to release breeds of new seeds that can replace or complete the existing seeds.

TI  - A qualitative exploration of the contributions of Polio Eradication Initiative to the Nigerian health system: policy implications for polio transition planning
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HEALTH
AB  - Background The Nigerian health care system is weak due to lack of coordination, fragmentation of services by donor funding of vertical services, dearth and poor distribution of resources, and inadequate infrastructures. The Global Polio Eradication Initiative has supported the country's health system and provided strategies and skills which need to be documented for use by other health programs attempting disease control or eradication. This study, therefore, explored the contributions of the Polio Eradication Initiative (PEI) activities to the operations of other health programs within the Nigerian health system from the perspectives of frontline workers and managers. Methods This cross-sectional qualitative study used key informant interviews (KIIs) and inductive thematic analysis. Twenty-nine KIIs were conducted with individuals who have been involved continuously in PEI activities for at least 12 months since the program's inception. This research was part of a more extensive study, the Synthesis and Translation of Research and Innovations from Polio Eradication (STRIPE), conducted in 2018. The KII tool focused on four major themes: work experience in other health programs, similarities and differences between polio programs and other health programs, contributions of polio programs, and missed opportunities for implementing polio lessons. All interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using a thematic framework. Results The implementation of the PEI has increased health promotion activities and coverage of maternal and child health interventions through the development of tangible and intangible resources, building the capacities of health workers and discovering innovations. The presence of a robust PEI program within a weakened health system of similar programs lacking such extensive support led to a shift in health workers' primary roles. This was perceived to reduce human resources efforts in rural areas with a limited workforce, and to affect other programs' service delivery. Conclusion The PEI has made a notable impact on the Nigerian health system. There should be hastened efforts to transition these resources from the PEI into other programs where there are missed opportunities and future control programs. The primary health care managers should continue integration efforts to ensure that programs leverage opportunities within successful programs to improve the health of the community members.

TI  - Seroprevalence of leptospirosis among high-risk population of Andaman Islands, India
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Leptospirosis is a severe spirochetal zoonosis in the world. It is considered an occupational disease of persons engaged in agriculture, sewage works, forestry, and animal slaughtering. A study was conducted with an objective of assessing the seroprevalence of leptospirosis among the high-risk groups of Andaman Islands. A total of 611 sera samples from different high-risk populations were collected and tested by microscopic agglutination test (MAT). Genetic characterization of the isolate was done by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) fingerprinting, and serological characterization was done using monoclonal antibody technique. Antibodies to leptospires were detected in 322 samples giving an overall seroprevalence of 52.7%. The seroprevalence was highest among agriculture workers (62.5%) followed by sewage workers (39.4%), animal handlers (37.5%), forest workers (27.3%), and butchers (30.0%). Seroprevalence among control population was 14.7%, which was comparatively less than that of the high-risk population groups. Subject sera were most commonly reacted with organisms of the serogroup Grippotyphosa followed by Australis, and the pattern was similar in control group. Four leptospires were isolated from agriculture workers who were admitted to the public health center (PHQ with complaints of fever and body ache. Human isolates were compared with two rodent (Rattus norvegicus) isolates from the same area of agriculture workers to get initial information about the transmission cycle of leptospirosis in the study community. Randomly amplified polymorphic DNA fingerprinting pattern of the strains recovered from the rodents and human patients were identified as belonged to genomo-species Leptospira interrogans. The antigenic characterization of the strains recovered from them belonged to serovar Valbuzzi of serogroup Grippotyphosa. The study showed that people engaged in high-risk activities such as agriculture, sewage cleaning, animal handling, animal slaughtering, and forestry are frequently exposed to leptospirosis, and hence control strategies targeting these populations could be more effective.

TI  - A bi-seasonal classification of woody plant species using Sentinel-2A and SPOT-6 in a localised species-rich savanna environment
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
AB  - Sustainable management of biodiversity benefit from cost-effectively multi-temporal classification schemes afforded by remote sensing techniques. This study compared classification accuracies of woody plant species (n = 27) and three coexisting land cover types using dry and wet seasons data. Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Deep Neural Network (DNN), were applied to Sentinel-2A and SPOT-6 images. The results showed higher overall classification accuracies for wet season data (65%-72%) for both images and classifiers (DNN, RF and SVM), compared to dry season classification (52%-59%). Near infrared region bands, available in both Sentinel-2A and SPOT-6 imagery, produced high performance for both wet (83%) and dry (80%) seasons. Overall, the findings shows potential of multispectral remote-sensing for woody plant species diversity in different seasons. Such a study should be extended to higher frequency species diversity classification, to capture dynamics that may manifest at short time intervals of the year.

TI  - Malaria among foreign migrant workers in Savannakhet Province, Lao People's Democratic Republic
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HEALTH
AB  - Background: Although mobile and migrant populations are considered an important group in malaria elimination settings, there is currently a lack of understanding about foreign migrant workers in the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR). The present study aimed to document the migration characteristics, positive rate of malaria infection, and preventive and treatment-seeking behavior for malaria among foreign migrant workers in the malaria-endemic districts of Savannakhet province, Lao PDR.
   Methods: A community-based survey was undertaken in four districts of Savannakhet province between February and June, 2015. Questionnaire-based interviews and blood examinations, including rapid diagnostic tests and PCR assays, were conducted with 391 migrant workers who were registered at local police departments.
   Results: Most of the study participants were men (75.7%) and Vietnamese (92.6%). The median age (interquartile range) was 31 (25 to 41) years old. Most common occupation was factory worker (47.6%), followed by trader/shopkeeper (21.5%) and plantation worker/farmer (16.4%). The median length of stay (interquartile range) in the districts was 405 (183 to 1207) days. The majority of the participants (85.9%) had not worked in a province other than the study province, nor had the majority (92.6%) worked in a foreign country other than the Lao PDR. Although most of the participants (62.7%) reportedly used a bed net daily, these nets were mostly conventional untreated ones. No one tested positive for malaria. However, 10.0% of the participants reported a malaria-like illness episode that had occurred in the Lao PDR. The most common measure taken for the episode was to visit a hospital/health center in the Lao PDR, followed by conducting self-medication alone. Forty-one participants reported an experience of working in the forest while living in the Lao PDR.
   Conclusions: Foreign migrant workers who are registered at local police departments are unlikely to play a major role in maintaining local transmissions and spreading drug-resistant malaria in the study province. However, some of them were involved in forest-related activities, suggesting that these workers are potentially at risk of malaria. The Lao National Malaria Control Program should educate foreign migrant workers about the risk of malaria when living in Lao PDR.

TI  - Cytotoxicity and inhibition of lipid peroxidation activity of resveratrol/cyclodextrin inclusion complexes
T2  - JOURNAL OF INCLUSION PHENOMENA AND MACROCYCLIC CHEMISTRY
AB  - Resveratrol (Res) is a plant-based polyphenol compound and is known to inhibit the growth of a variety of cancer cells and protect lipoproteins against oxidative damage. However the poor solubility and labile property may constitute a serious problem for its bioavailability. The problem could be overcome by the formation of inclusion complexes with cyclodextrins (CDs). The aim of this work is to include Res by beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) and 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HP-CD) to form the Res/beta-CD and Res/HP-CD inclusion complexes and evaluate their cytotoxicity on cancer cells and inhibition of lipid peroxidation activity. The complexes are characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The cytotoxicity of the two complexes has been evaluated by methylthiazoletetrazolium reduction assay on two cancer cell lines (cervical carcinoma cells HeLa and hepatocellular liver cancer cells Hep3B) and one normal cell line (umbililical vein endothelial cell HUVEC). The results showed that the two complexes exhibit high cytotoxicity on two cancer cells, especially for Hep3B, and show no significant effect on normal cells. The Res/HP-CD complex shows higher cytotoxicity on the two cancer cells than that of the Res/beta-CD complex. The inhibition of lipid peroxidation induced by Fe2+/ascorbate of the two inclusion complexes has been determined by thiobarbituric acid assay. The inhibition rate shows a linear increase with the increase of CDs concentration, and the Res/HP-CD complex shows stronger inhibition activity than that of the Res/beta-CD complex. The results of this work indicate a potential for using the Res/CD complexes to inhibit human cancer growth and lipoproteins peroxidation.

TI  - Species richness and temporal partitioning in the beetle fauna of oak trees (Quercus robur L.) in Richmond Park, UK
T2  - INSECT CONSERVATION AND DIVERSITY
AB  - 1. Species richness, abundance, body size, biomass, guild structure and temporal partitioning were examined in samples of 150 beetle species from oaks (Quercus robur L.) in southern Britain. 2. Abundance, species richness and biomass were highest in late June when leaves are in full flush, similar through much of the year for oak specialist beetle species, but were highest in July for generalists. Body size did not appear to vary significantly during the sampling period. 3. Temporal partitioning of feeding guilds was evident; predators and herbivores, peaked earlier in MayJune, and fungivores and scavengers peaked in JulyAugust. 4. Groups of closely related species, in Carabidae, Cantharidae and Curculionidae, often had similar seasonal patterns suggesting that temporal variation in both overall species richness and abundance for different guilds may be driven by resource availability rather than competition between closely related species. 5. Multidimensional scaling ordination shows an almost circular pattern in the beetle community underpinned by the most abundant species occurring throughout the year; vector analysis indicates that as temperatures increase and food resources become available, other species become abundant and influence patterns of similarity. 6. These patterns are also influenced by species that (i) have life cycles of 2 or more years, (ii) move between the ground, tree trunks and the canopy during the year and (iii) move from other tree species to oaks as these tree species lose their leaves earlier in Autumn. 7. The hypothesis that temporal patterns for invertebrate species in temperate trees are more coordinated than those in tropical trees is not supported.

TI  - Mosquitocidal activities of Malaysian plants
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL FOREST SCIENCE
AB  - Extracts from about 30 species of plants in Malaysia were tested for their ability to kill the larvae or to repel or knock down the adults of Aedes aegypti, the vector mosquito for dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fever. Observation of mortality was made after 24 hours of exposure to the plant extract/essential oil to obtain the median lethal concentration (LC50) of the plant extract/essential oil tested. In repellency and knockdown effects of adult mosquitoes, median effective concentration (EC50) was obtained after each test. The three best extracts for killing larvae were the essential oils of Zanthoxylum acanthopodium stem, Aquilaria malaccensis wood and Pelargonium citrosum plant. For repelling adult mosquitoes, the most effective was the leaf essential oil of Cymbopogon nardus, followed by that of A. malaccensis. Knock-down ability was best with mosquito coils made from the seed kernel of Azadirachta indica, followed by the leaf of C nardus and the wood of Fernandoa adenophylla.

TI  - Environmental factors associated With <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> Exposure in Neotropical Primates of Costa Rica
T2  - FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE
AB  - The apicomplexan parasite Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) has been found in more than 350 species of homoeothermic vertebrates in diverse climates and geographic areas. In most animals, T. gondii produces mild or asymptomatic infection. However, acute and hyperacute toxoplasmosis is associated with high mortality rates observed in Neotropical primates (NP) in captivity. These primates are distributed in 20 countries across the Americas, and although infection has been reported in certain countries and species, toxoplasmosis in the wild and its impact on NP population survival is unknown. Differences among species in exposure rates and disease susceptibility may be due in part to differences in host behavior and ecology. Four species of NP are found in Costa Rica, i.e., howler (Alouatta palliata), spider (Ateles geoffroyi), capuchin (Cebus imitator), and squirrel monkeys (Saimiri oerstedii). This study reports NP exposure to T. gondii using the modified agglutination test in 245 serum samples of NP (198 wild and 47 from captivity) from Costa Rica. Associations of serostatus with environmental (forest cover, annual mean temperature), anthropogenic (human population density), and biological (sex) variables in howler and capuchin monkeys were evaluated. The seroprevalence among wild NP was 11.6% (95% CI = 7.7-17.34), compared with 60% in captive monkeys (95% CI = 44.27-73.63), with significant differences between species (X-2 = 20.072; df = 3, p = 0.000164), suggesting an effect of behavior and ecology. In general, antibody titers were low for wild NP (<1:128) and high for captive NP (>1:8192), suggesting higher exposure due to management factors and increased life span in captivity. Seropositivity in howler monkeys was positively related to forest cover and inversely related to annual rainfall. For capuchins, annual rainfall was inversely related to seropositivity. Surveillance of T. gondii exposure in NP in captivity and in the wild is required to understand drivers of the infection and develop novel strategies to protect them.

TI  - Seroprevalence and associated risk factors of strongyloidiasis in indigenous communities and healthcare professionals from Brazil
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Author summaryHuman strongyloidiasis, caused mainly by nematoda Strongyloides stercoralis, with estimate of infecting around 613.9 million people worldwide, and may play a pivotal role in causing morbidity in aboriginals and indigenous populations worldwide. Nevertheless, prevalence and risk factors for Strongyloides stercoralis in Brazilian indigenous populations remains to be fully established. The present study was the first comparative report of S. stercoralis seroprevalence in indigenous population and healthcare professionals. A high seroprevalence to Strongyloides stercoralis in indigenous communities of Brazil along with even higher exposure of healthcare professionals was reported and should be considered as vulnerability and health worker exposure. Male and adult indigenous persons were more likely seropositive as associated risk factors, while having septic tank as a sanitary facility represented a protective factor for S. stercoralis exposure. Thus, the present study has alerted for the public health concerns of strongyloidiasis in such vulnerable populations, particularly when lacking sanitation conditions. Finally, a further One Health approach may contribute for better understanding the strongyloidiasis exposure including the environmental, animal, and human components to battle this important parasitic neglected disease in indigenous communities.
   Strongyloides stercoralis, a pathogenic roundworm, is considered endemic in several tropical and subtropical areas worldwide. Indigenous populations have the highest soil-transmitted helminthiases-related mortality rates, but the prevalence and risk factors associated with S. stercoralis in Brazilian indigenous populations have not been established. Thus, the present study aimed to assess the seroprevalence and associated risk factors for S. stercoralis in indigenous communities and the healthcare professionals serving them in Brazil. Indigenous populations living in nine communities and healthcare professionals were tested for anti- S. stercoralis antibodies by ELISA. A questionnaire was used to assess socio-epidemiological information. Associated risk factors for seropositivity were tested by chi-square or Fisher's exact tests, using bivariate analyses and multivariate logistic regression. Overall, 174/463 (37.6%; CI 95%: 33.3-42.1) indigenous persons and 77/147 (52.4%; 95% CI: 44.3-60.3) healthcare professionals were seropositive for anti- S. stercoralis antibodies. Seropositivity among the two groups was statistically significant (p = 0.0016; OR = 0.547; 95% CI: 0.376-0.796) and revealed that healthcare professionals were 1.83 times more likely to be seropositive. The multivariate analysis showed that being male or being adult were also risk factors, while having a septic tank as a sanitary facility represented a protective factor for S. stercoralis exposure in indigenous persons. None of the variables evaluated were associated with S. stercoralis exposure in the professional group. The study herein has reported a high seroprevalence to Strongyloides stercoralis in indigenous communities of Brazil and healthcare professionals, warning for potential public health concerns of strongyloidiasis in such populations.

TI  - CASE STUDY OF A PATIENT WITH HIV-AIDS AND VISCERAL LEISHMANIASIS CO-INFECTION IN MULTIPLE EPISODES
T2  - REVISTA DO INSTITUTO DE MEDICINA TROPICAL DE SAO PAULO
AB  - Report of a 45-year-old male farmer, a resident in the forest zone of Pernambuco, who was diagnosed with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in 1999 and treated using antiretroviral (ARV) drugs. In 2005, the first episode of visceral leishmaniasis (VL), as assessed by parasitological diagnosis of bone marrow aspirate, was recorded. When admitted to the hospital, the patient presented fever, hepatosplenomegaly, weight loss, and diarrhea. Since then, six additional episodes of VL occurred, with a frequency rate of one per year (2005-2012, except in 2008). In 2011, the patient presented a disseminated skin lesion caused by the amastigotes of Leishmania, as identified by histopathological assessment of skin biopsy samples. In 2005, he was treated with N-methyl-glucamine-antimony and amphotericin B deoxycholate. However, since 2006 because of a reported toxicity, the drug of choice was liposomal amphotericin B. As recommended by the Ministry of Health, this report emphasizes the need for HIV patients living in VL endemic areas to include this parasitosis in their follow-up protocol, particularly after the first infection of VL.

T2  - JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE DISEASES
AB  - We documented ectoparasites found on wild black-and-white ruffed lemurs (Varecia variegata) in the southeastern rain forests of Madagascar and describe trends in parasitism. In this study, 235 mesostigmatid mites (1 male, 87 females, 147 nymphs) identified as Liponyssella sp., in the acarine family Macronyssidae, were collected during 87% (34/39) of lemur examinations (mean number/host = 7.9). The only other ectoparasite collected was the louse fly (Allobosca crassipes; 3 males, 8 females) in the dipteran family Hippoboscidae, which was collected during 26% (10/39) of lemur examinations (mean number/host = 1.1). The lemur most heavily parasitized by mites was an adult female with 29 adult females and 17 nymphs, all collected from the face.

TI  - The application of the 'Gene-deletor' technology in banana
T2  - PLANT CELL TISSUE AND ORGAN CULTURE
AB  - Key message These results suggest that LFY promoter could not completely drive the 'Gene-deletor' vector to achieve the effect of complete elimination of exogenous gene in bananas. Nevertheless, a certain effect of exogenous gene elimination laid a theoretical foundation for the next step of screening banana fruit-specific promoters, removing all exogenous genes from banana fruits, and solving the food safety problem of genetically modified bananas.
   Banana (Musa spp.) is an important tropical crop. Banana industry is under biotic and abiotic stresses such as Fusarium wilt, typhoon, cold stress. Genetic engineering offers a powerful strategy to create germplasm of banana with enhanced resistance. The safety of genetically modified organisms has become a bottleneck restricting the popularization and application of genetically modified technology. In this study, a candidate promoter, LEAFY (LFY) for expression and flower initiation in Arabidopsis, was cloned and constructed to 'Gene-deletor' vector. Histochemical beta-glucuronidase (GUS) staining results showed that the 'Gene-deletor' vector driven by LFY promoter could lead to 88.5% excision efficiency from Arabidopsis seeds based on more than 200 T-3 progeny examined per event. GUS staining was found to be partially negative in transgenic bananas, however, polymerase chain reaction could still detect the presence of large fragments of the vector. These results suggest that although LFY promoter could not completely drive the 'Gene-deletor' vector to achieve the effect of complete elimination of exogenous gene in bananas, its efficiency of eliminating exogenous gene laid a theoretical foundation for cloning banana fruit-specific promoters, that is, 'non-transgenic' GM bananas.

TI  - Dynamic behavior of sylvatic yellow fever in Brazil (1954-2008)
T2  - REVISTA DA SOCIEDADE BRASILEIRA DE MEDICINA TROPICAL
AB  - Introduction: Sylvatic yellow fever (SYF) is enzootic in Brazil, causing periodic outbreaks in humans living near forest borders or in rural areas. In this study, the cycling patterns of this arbovirosis were analyzed. Methods: Spectral Fourier analysis was used to capture the periodicity patterns of SYF in time series. Results: SYF outbreaks have not increased in frequency, only in the number of cases. There are two dominant cycles in SYF outbreaks, a seven year cycle for the central-western region and a 14 year cycle for the northern region. Most of the variance was concentrated in the central-western region and dominated the entire endemic region. Conclusions: The seven year cycle is predominant in the endemic region of the disease due the greater contribution of variance in the central-western region; however, it was possible identify a 14 cycle that governs SYF outbreaks in the northern region. No periodicities were identified for the remaining geographical regions.

TI  - A proposed description of the natural life cycle of <i>Amblyomma brasiliense</i> (Acari: Ixodidae) in a primary Atlantic rainforest environment in Brazil
T2  - SYSTEMATIC AND APPLIED ACAROLOGY
AB  - The life cycles, under experimental conditions, of many neotropical ticks including Amblyomma brasiliense Aragao have been elucidated, however relatively little information is available with reference to their life cycles under natural conditions. The present study sought to investigate the natural life cycle of A. brasiliense, an aggressive human biting tick, within the Itatiaia National Park (INP), Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil. A total of 245 ticks, collected from wild birds, peccaries (Tayassu pecari) and humans or recovered free-living on forest trails, were included in the analyses. All ticks were identified as A. brasiliense using a combination of morphological and molecular techniques (polymerase chain reaction and nucleotide sequencing). The parasitological data produced in this investigation, were combined with findings from previous studies to elaborate a proposed, natural life cycle for A. brasiliense in the INP, a preserved Atlantic rainforest habitat. It is suggested that, T. pecari serve as primary hosts, with wild birds and small mammals functioning as alternative hosts for immature stages and that humans may act as occasional hosts, possibly in consequence of eco-tourism activities. The molecular analyses performed in this study resulted in the identification and deposition of new sequences for fragments of the mitochondrial genes encoding 12S ribosomal RNA (12S rRNA) and cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI). The availability of those sequences will be beneficial to other researchers conducting future or retrospective analysis of tick sequencing data. Finally, in common with previous surveys, molecular screening by PCR for the 17kDa and gltA targets provided no evidence for A. brasiliense as a vector of Rickettsia sp.

TI  - A multi-hazard approach to assess severe weather-induced major power outage risks in the US
T2  - RELIABILITY ENGINEERING & SYSTEM SAFETY
AB  - Severe weather-induced power outages affect millions of people and cost billions of dollars of economic losses each year. The National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners have recently highlighted the importance of building electricity sector's resilience, and thereby enhancing service-security and long-term economic benefits. In this paper, we propose a multi-hazard approach to characterize the key predictors of severe weather induced sustained power outages. We developed a two-stage hybrid risk estimation model, leveraging algorithmic data-mining techniques. We trained our risk models using publicly available information on historical major power outages, socio-economic data, state-level climatological observations, electricity consumption patterns and land-use data. Our results suggest that power outage risk is a function of various factors such as the type of natural hazard, expanse of overhead T&D systems, the extent of state-level rural versus urban areas, and potentially the levels of investments in operations/maintenance activities (e.g., tree-trimming, replacing old equipment, etc.). The proposed framework can help state regulatory commissions make risk-informed resilience investment decisions. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Onchocerciasis: the clinical and epidemiological burden of skin disease in Africa
T2  - ANNALS OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND PARASITOLOGY
AB  - An attempt was made to assess the true public-health importance of onchocercal skin disease throughout the African region and hence provide an objective basis for the rational planning of onchocerciasis control in the area. The seven collaborative centres that participated in the study (three in Nigeria and one each in Ghana, Cameroon, Tanzania and Uganda) were all in areas of rainforest or savannah-forest mosaic where onchocercal blindness is not common. A cross-sectional dermatological survey was undertaken at each site following a standard protocol. At each site, the aim was to examine at least 750 individuals aged greater than or equal to 5 years and living in highly endemic communities and 220-250 individuals aged greater than or equal to 5 years and living in a hypo-endemic (control) community. Overall, there were 5459 and 1451 subjects from hyper-and hypo-endemic communities, respectively.
   In the highly endemic communities, the prevalence of itching increased with age until 20 years and then plateaued, affecting 42% of the population aged greater than or equal to 20 years. There was a strong correlation between the prevalence of itching and the level of endemicity (as measured by the prevalence of nodules; r = 0.75; P < 0.001). The results of a multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that, at the individual level, the presence of onchocercal reactive skin lesions (acute papular onchodermatitis, chronic papular onchodermatitis and/or lichenified onchodermatitis) was the most important risk factor for pruritus, with an odds ratio (OR) of 18.3 and 95% confidence interval (CI) of 15.19-22.04, followed by the presence of palpable onchocercal nodules (OR = 4.63; Cl = 4.05-5.29). In contrast, non-onchocercal skin disease contributed very little to pruritus in the study communities (OR = 1.29; CI = 1.1-1.51). Onchocercal skin lesions affected 28% of the population in the endemic villages. The commonest type was chronic papular onchodermatitis (13%.), followed by depigmentation (10%) and acute papular onchodermatitis (7%). The highest correlation with endemicity was seen for the prevalence of any onchocercal skin lesion and/or pruritus combined (r= 0.8; P< 0.001).
   Cutaneous onchocerciasis was found to be a common problem in many endemic areas in Africa which do not have high levels of onchocercal blindness, These findings, together with recent observations that onchocercal skin disease can have major, adverse, psycho social and socio economic effects, justify the inclusion of regions with onchocercal skin disease in control programmes based on ivermectin distribution. On the basis of these findings, the World Health Organization launched a control programme for onchocerciasis, the African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control (APOC), that covers 17 endemic countries in Africa.

T2  - REVISTA DA SOCIEDADE BRASILEIRA DE MEDICINA TROPICAL
AB  - Introduction: Understanding the diversity of sand flies is important for the epidemiology and control of leishmaniasis. This study aimed to understand the frequency, diversity, and seasonality of medically important sand flies in the municipality of Sinop, State of Mato Grosso, Brazil. Methods: The study was conducted in an urban area, including four ecotypes with different levels of urbanization. The sand flies were collected using light traps for three nights per month, from May 2014 to April 2015. Results: A total of 62,745 sand flies was collected, 52.34% of which were female. The frequency and diversity of sand flies was the highest in areas of permanent preservation (APPs) (96.85%), and was lower in more urbanized areas. Lutzomyia dasypodogeton was the most frequent species in the APPs. Lutzomyia antunesi was the most frequent in neighborhoods with forest fragments and neighborhoods around APPs, and L. aragaoi was the most frequent in completely urbanized neighborhoods. A higher frequency and diversity of sand flies was observed in the rainy season (87.92%) than in the dry season (12.08%). Eight medically important species were captured, and Lutzomyia antunesi, which is associated with American cutaneous leishmaniasis and visceral leishmaniasis, was observed in all ecotypes throughout the year. Conclusions: We observed a high frequency and diversity of sand flies in all urban areas, and some species collected were major vectors of leishmaniasis. These results support the need for further studies of the natural rates of infection of these insects and the circulation of the disease in hosts and vectors.

TI  - A preliminary report on ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) recovered from forensic entomological studies conducted in different ecological habitats in Malaysia
T2  - TROPICAL BIOMEDICINE
AB  - This study reported the ant species that were recovered from monkey carcasses in three different ecological habitats in Malaysia. The study was conducted from 9 May - 10 October 2007, 6 May - 6 August 2008 and 26 May - 14 July 2009 in forested area (Gombak, Selangor), coastal area (Tanjong Sepat, Selangor) and highland area (Bukit Cincin, Pahang), respectively. Monkey carcass was used as a model for human decomposition in this study. A total of 4 replicates were used in each of the study sites. Ants were observed to prey on eggs, larvae, pupae and newly emerged flies. This study found that ant species could be found at all stages of decomposition, indicating that ants were not a significant indicator for faunal succession. However, different species of ants were obtained from monkey carcasses placed in different ecological habitats. Cardiocondyla sp. was only found on carcasses placed in the coastal area; while Pheidole longipes, Hypoponera sp. and Pachycondyla sp. were solely found on carcasses placed in the highland area. On the other hand, Pheidologeton diversus and Paratrechina longicornis were found in several ecological habitats. These data suggests that specific ant species can act as geographic indicators for different ecological habitats in forensic entomology cases in Malaysia.

TI  - Preliminary assessment of antioxidant activity of young edible leaves of seven <i>Ficus</i> species in the ethnic diet in Xishuangbanna, Southwest China
T2  - FOOD CHEMISTRY
AB  - The young leaves of seven Ficus species including F. virens var. sublanceolata. F. auriculata, F. vasculosa, F. callosa, F. virens var. verins, F. racemosa and F. oligodon are traditionally consumed by local people in Xishuangbanna. The dry young leaves were studied for their total phenolic and flavonoid contents. The 90% ethanolic extracts of the young leaves were screened for potential antioxidant capacity by employing different in vitro assays including ABTS(+) and DPPH- radical scavenging capacities, ferric reducing power and lipid peroxidation inhibition properties. Extracts from F. virens var. sublanceolata and F. auriculata showed higher antioxidant activity in all the systems than other species. We concluded that these two species are promising sources of natural dietary antioxidants. According to our statistical analysis, the total phenolic and flavonoid contents appear to be responsible, at least in part, for the extracts' excellent antioxidant capacity and all the extracts exhibited dose-dependent antioxidant activity.

TI  - Comparison of Four Automatic Classifiers for Cancer Cell Phenotypes Using M-Phase Features Extracted from Brightfield Microscopy Images
T2  - HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTING, CARLA 2019
CP  - 6th Latin American Conference on High Performance Computing (CARLA)
AB  - In our in vitro study to model and understand the regulation networks that control the live and death of the cells, it is fundamental to quantify the contribution of each of the cancer cell' phenotypes: apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, DNA damage repair, and DNA damage proliferation. For that, an automatic microscope is used to generate several images of cell populations using brightfield microscopy. In the scientific literature, several methods to extract features from microscopy images are available, but mostly for fluorescence or contrast phase microscopy, which have the disadvantage of being phototoxic to the cells, and therefore unsuitable for our study. In this paper a successful method to automatically extract and classify the phenotypes of cancer cells is presented. The method uses features extracted automatically from the M-phase (mitosis) of cells from images obtained by brightfield microscopy. The classification results are validated by comparing them with the correct manually annotated classes for each instance. Four different classifiers: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), k-Nearest Neighbours (kNN), and Random Forests (RF) are compared using standard comparison metrics, such as precision, recall and F1-score. It is finally shown that the LDA classifier provided the best results, reaching an overall f1-score of 0.78 and an overall weighted f1-score of 0.88.

TI  - Incidence and severity of bean rust (<i>Uromyces appendiculatus</i>) in alleys between <i>Leucaena</i> hedgerows in kenya
T2  - NEW FORESTS
AB  - The effects of inter-row spacing of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit in an alley cropping system on the incidence and severity of rust (Uromyces appendiculatus (Pers.) Unger) on intercropped beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) and their yield were examined over 2 years (1993 and 1994) at Chepkoilel Campus in Kenya. Each experiment consisted of three randomized blocks with treatments of three alley widths (2 m, 4 m and 8 m) and a treeless control with two intra-row spacings of Leucaena (0.5 m and 1.0 m). Hedgerows were coppiced at 1.0 m height and pruned subsequently at 2-3 months intervals. No fertilizer was applied but Leucaena loppings were incorporated as green leaf manure. Rust on beans was assessed at three growth stages in each season, using the Centro International de Agricultura Tropical (CIAT) scales. Microclimate was monitored in treatments, in 1994. Bean growth and yield were also measured. Rust increased with increasing alley width and was less severe in bean rows adjacent to hedgerows. Bean yield was highest in the treeless control plots and declined with decreasing alley width. Beans in 2 m alleys had significantly lower (p < 0.05) yields than 8 m alleys and treeless control plots. Bean growth was greatly modified in 2 m alleys and close to hedgerows. Light availability and diurnal temperature increased with alley width but relative humidity and leaf wetness duration decreased. Proximity to hedgerows also had marked effect on microclimate. The changes in yield, rust incidence and severity were examined in relation to microclimate, inoculum survival and dispersal.

TI  - Toxoplasmosis seroprevalence in rheumatoid arthritis patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   Toxoplasmosis is a cosmopolitan infection caused by an intracellular obligatory protozoan, Toxoplasma gondii. Infection to this parasite in immunocompetent patients is usually asymptomatic, but today it is believed that the infection can be a risk factor for a variety of diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA). RA is an autoimmune disease and the most common type of inflammatory arthritis that is a major cause of disability. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to address the association between RA and toxoplasmosis in light of the available research.
   Methods
   Based on the keywords, a systematic search of eight databases was conducted to retrieve the relevant English-language articles. Then, the studies were screened based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The random effect model was used to calculate the odds ratio (OR) using forest plot with 95% confidence interval (CI).
   Results
   Overall, 4168 Individual, extracted from 9 articles were included for systematic review evaluation, with 1369 RA patients (46% positive toxoplasmosis) and 2799 individuals as controls (21% positive toxoplasmosis). Then, eight articles (10 datasets) were used for meta-analysis (1244 rheumatoid arthritis patients and 2799 controls). By random effect model, the combined OR was 3.30 (95% CI: 2.05 to 5.30) with P < 0.0001.
   Conclusion
   Although toxoplasmosis could be considered as a potential risk factor for rheumatoid arthritis, more and better quality studies are needed to determine the effect of T. gondii infection on induction or exacerbation of RA. Our study was registered at the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews.

TI  - Genet and reef position effects in out-planting of nursery-grown <i>Acropora cervicornis</i> (Scleractinia: Acroporidae) in Montego Bay, Jamaica
T2  - REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL
AB  - The reef-building coral Acropora cervicornis was a dominant ecosystem element on the Caribbean reef until the 1980s, when it declined by some 97% due primarily to anthropogenic ecosystem changes and disease. This branching species expanded its colony footprint and achieved local dominance largely through fragmentation and regrowth, thus is suited to nursery culture towards restoration. In this experiment, fragments of Acropora cervicornis of four lineages or genets were followed and measured for growth and health over 12 months in 2006 and 2007 on buoyant drop-loop line nurseries at one shallow and one deep fore-reef site in Montego Bay, Jamaica. Sixty-five of these corals were then out-planted to wild reef sites of similar depth and condition to their respective nurseries and monitored photographically for 11 months through 2007 and 2008. A period of rapid death was seen in the out-planted material at both sites over the first four months, followed by a period of relative stability or recuperation. Hermodice carunculata predation was the primary problem in the shallow fore-reef, and was combined with a banding syndrome at the deeper site. This syndrome was noted in the samples prior to planting, during a one week storage period on the seafloor. Continued slow decline occurred in the subsequent seven months in the shallow fore-reef site; however, regrowth was noted in the deeper site in the remaining material. Including these losses, final total live coral length was more than fourfold greater than the initial wild harvest: a net increase through multi-stage propagative restoration or coral gardening. Returns were noted particularly in the faster-growing genets of the nursery and larger planted corals tended to retain more material at eleven months, suggesting that propagative restoration programmes invest in stronger genets and larger corals. Adaptive management and maintenance gardening of the planted material and reef would likely have greatly improved outcomes.

TI  - <i>Ixeris dentata</i> (Thunb) Nakai attenuates cognitive impairment in MPTP-treated mouse model of Parkinson's disease
T2  - TROPICAL JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH
AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the cognition-enhancing effect of Ixeris dentata (Thunb) Nakai in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease (PD).
   Methods: MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine)-induced mouse model of PD was used to evaluate the effect of Ixeris dentata (IDE) extract on the alteration of behavioral responses using rotarod and passive avoidance tests. The effect of IDE on oxidative stress levels were analyzed based on superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) enzyme levels, and lipid peroxidation (LPO) in brain tissues.
   Results: MPTP (20 mg/kg, ip)-induced mice resulted in a significant (p < 0.01) behavioral deficiencies in locomotor behavior (from 53.15 +/- 1.01 to 23.56 +/- 1.04) and cognitive functions (from 297 +/- 2.47 to 201.17 +/- 3.23 s) compared with their respective control groups. Administration of IDE (20, 40 and 80 mg/kg, po) for three weeks significantly and dose-dependently improved (p < 0.001 at 80 mg/kg) locomotor and cognitive deficits in MPTP-treated mice. IDE treatment also significantly (p < 0.01 at 80 mg/kg) inhibited decrease in superoxide dismutase and catalase enzyme activities, and lipid peroxides in MPTP-treated mice in brain tissues.
   Conclusion: IDE exhibits good protection against MPTP-induced behavioral deficits via potential antioxidant defense mechanisms. Therefore, IDE could potentially be developed as a therapeutic approach for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

TI  - The Influence of Socio-economic, Behavioural and Environmental Factors on <i>Taenia</i> spp. Transmission in Western Kenya: Evidence from a Cross-Sectional Survey in Humans and Pigs
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Taenia spp. infections, particularly cysticercosis, cause considerable health impacts in endemic countries. Despite previous evidence of spatial clustering in cysticercosis and the role of environmental factors (e. g. temperature and humidity) in the survival of eggs, little research has explored these aspects of Taenia spp. epidemiology. In addition, there are significant gaps in our understanding of risk factors for infection in humans and pigs. This study aimed to assess the influence of socio-economic, behavioural and environmental variables on human and porcine cysticercosis. A cross-sectional survey for human taeniasis (T. solium and T. saginata), human cysticercosis (T. solium) and pig cysticercosis (T. solium) in 416 households in western Kenya was carried out. These data were linked to questionnaire responses and environmental datasets. Multi-level regression was used to examine the relationships between covariates and human and porcine cysticercosis. The HP10 Ag-ELISA sero-prevalence (suggestive of cysticercosis) was 6.6% for humans (95% CI 5.6%-7.7%), and 17.2% for pigs (95% CI 10.2%-26.4%). Human taeniasis prevalence, based on direct microscopic observation of Taenia spp. eggs (i. e. via microscopy results only) was 0.2% (95% CI 0.05%-0.5%). Presence of Taenia spp. antigen in both humans and pigs was significantly associated with a range of factors, including positive correlations with land cover. The presence of HP10 antigen in humans was correlated (non-linearly) with the proportion of land within a 1 km buffer that was flooding agricultural land and grassland (odds ratio [OR] = 1.09 and 0.998; p = 0.03 and 0.03 for the linear and quadratic terms respectively), gender (OR = 0.58 for males compared to females, p = 0.02), level of education (OR = 0.62 for primary level education versus no formal education, p = 0.09), use of well water for drinking (OR = 2.76 for those who use well water versus those who do not, p = 0.02) and precipitation (OR = 0.998, p = 0.02). Presence of Taenia spp. antigen in pigs was significantly correlated with gender and breeding status of the pig (OR = 10.35 for breeding sows compared to boars, p = 0.01), and the proportion of land within a 1 km buffer that was flooding agricultural land and grassland (OR = 1.04, p = 0.004). These results highlight the role of multiple socio-economic, behavioural and environmental factors in Taenia spp. transmission patterns. Environmental contamination with Taenia spp. eggs is a key issue, with landscape factors influencing presence of Taenia spp. antigens in both pigs and humans.

TI  - MIGRANTS AND MALARIA RISK FACTORS: A STUDY OF THE THAI-MYANMAR BORDER
T2  - SOUTHEAST ASIAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate factors influencing self-reported malaria among migrants living along the Thai-Myanmar border. Songkaria Village, with 1600 inhabitants and 290 households in Sangkhla Buri District, Kanchanaburi Province, was selected for the study due to its intense malaria transmission. One hundred twenty-five households were randomly selected. Household members were interviewed about the history of malaria, socioeconomic status and knowledge and practices in regard to malaria using a structured questionnaire Of the respondents, 10%, 42%, and 48% belonged to the Thai, Mon, and Karen ethnic groups, respectively. About 40% of Thai and Karen migrants and almost 30% of Mon migrants reported having Suffered from malaria at least once. Multivariate analysis focused on migrants. The results identified three independent factors for previous malaria a high risk occupation, te working primarily in the forest [odds ratio (OR), 3.55; 95% confidence interval 1.3-10.0], ability to read Thai [OR, 4.13 (1.5-11 7)], and correct knowledge about malaria symptoms [OR, 5.18 (1 1-23 5)]. Working conditions among migrants played a major role in acquiring malaria They could not afford to apply additional preventive measures, such as using a mosquito net or repellent to be used while working. The concept of enhancing the environment for migrants to enable them to protect themselves against malaria needs to be examined. Ways and means of improving the economic conditions of migrants should be considered to minimize exposure to the vector.

TI  - UAV-based individual shrub aboveground biomass estimation calibrated against terrestrial LiDAR in a shrub-encroached grassland
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
AB  - Shrub encroachment is an important ecological issue that is increasingly receiving global attention in arid and semiarid grasslands. Monitoring the spatial distribution of encroached shrub aboveground biomass (AGB) is critical for ecological conservation and adaptive ecosystem management. However, the low stature and fine spatial heterogeneity of encroached shrub communities increase difficulties for coarse spatial-resolution satellite images to adequately capture detailed characteristics of individual shrubs. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) can acquire centimeter-level optical images or high-density LiDAR point cloud data, providing an effective means to map encroached shrub AGB spatially explicitly, even at the individual scale. In this study, we first extracted the individual shrubs based on thresholds in normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and canopy height model (CHM) using UAV-based multispectral and LiDAR data. For each shrub, we then derived and determined the dominant geometric, spectral, and textural features from the high-resolution multispectral image and the volumetric features from the LiDAR data as predictors of shrub AGB. Finally, we compared the capability of different data sources (UAV-based multispectral image, LiDAR, and their combination) and regression methods (multiple linear, random forest, and support vector regression) to estimate and map the individual shrub AGB in the study area. The volume-based approaches to individual shrub AGB, including global convex hull method, voxel method, and surface differencing method, were also employed using terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) to further calibrate the UAV-based estimation. Our results show that individual shrubs can be accurately extracted based on the threshold method with an overall classification accuracy of 91.8%. The UAV-based AGB estimation suggests that the textural feature, the sum of contrast metric within the individual shrub canopy, is the most important predictor of individual shrub AGB, followed by volumetric, geometric and spectral features. Moreover, the high-resolution multispectral image shows greater potential (R2 = 0.83, RMSE = 106.46 g) than LiDAR (R2 = 0.77, RMSE = 123.33 g) in the estimation of individual shrub AGB, and their combination can only slightly improve the estimation accuracy (R2 = 0.86, RMSE = 101.97 g). Our results also show that TLS-derived volume based on the surface differencing method obtained the best prediction accuracy of individual shrub AGB (R2 = 0.91, RMSE = 79.98 g), and can be used as an alternative of destructive harvesting. This study provides a new insight for quantifying and mapping individual shrub AGB using UAV-based optical sensors and TLS without destructive harvesting in arid and semiarid grasslands.

TI  - From the organismal to biosphere levels: environmental impacts on the amphibian microbiota
T2  - FEMS MICROBIOLOGY REVIEWS
AB  - This review summarizes the role of environmental factors on amphibian microbiotas at the organismal, population, community, ecosystem, and biosphere levels. At the organismal-level, tissue source, disease status, and experimental manipulations were the strongest predictors of variation in amphibian microbiotas. At the population-level, habitat quality, disease status, and ancestry were commonly documented as drivers of microbiota turnover. At the community-level, studies focused on how species' niche influence microbiota structure and function. At the ecosystem-level, abiotic and biotic reservoirs were important contributors to microbiota structure. At the biosphere-level, databases, sample banks, and seminatural experiments were commonly used to describe microbiota assembly mechanisms among temperate and tropical amphibians. Collectively, our review demonstrates that environmental factors can influence microbiotas through diverse mechanisms at all biological scales. Importantly, while environmental mechanisms occurring at each of the different scales can interact to shape microbiotas, the past 10 years of research have mostly been characterized by targeted approaches at individual scales. Looking forward, efforts considering how environmental factors at multiple organizational levels interact to shape microbiota diversity and function are paramount. Generating opportunities for meaningful cross-disciplinary interactions and supporting infrastructure for research that spans biological scales are imperative to addressing this gap.
   This review synthesizes over a decade of knowledge, gaps, and future directions on the influence of environmental factors on amphibian microbiotas at multiple biological levels of organization.

TI  - Forage quality in grazing lawns and tall grasslands in the subtropical region of Nepal and implications for wild herbivores
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - Subtropical grasslands interspersed in forests often present mosaics of tall grasslands and grazing lawns with a high variation in structure, biomass and nutrient concentration. However, the impact of such variation on forage quality is still poorly known. We quantified physical and chemical properties of grasses of grazing lawns and tall grasslands, interspersed in the forested region of Bardia National Park, Nepal during the hot-dry season. This area falls within Cwaclimate (Ko center dot ppen-Geigen climate classification). We found that grasses in grazing lawns had an average bulk density of -5400 g.m-3 whereas tall grasslands had an average bulk density of -1000 g.m-3 only. Forage in grazing lawns was comprised of a higher percentage of green leaf (up to 60%) compared to tall grassland (up to 40%). Phosphorus levels in green leaves were below maintenance requirements of wild herbivores (especially for grazers and mixed feeders) on both grazing lawns and tall grasslands. However, average crude protein levels in green leaves from both the grazing lawns and tall grasslands could meet the herbivores maintenance requirement (-7%). Only green leaves on grazing lawns had crude protein levels sufficient enough (9.7%) to meet the requirements of herbivores for maintenance and gestation, though not for lactation. We conclude that, during the hot-dry season, grazing lawns provide forage with a higher quantity and quality than tall grasslands. Consequently, grazing lawns can make a significant contribution to the maintenance or even growth of the grassland dependent wild ungulate population, such as chital (Axis axis), a primary prey species of the endangered tiger (Panthera tigris) in Bardia National Park. The insight of this study will provide a basis for restoring grazing lawns for quality forage, and aid in the conservation and management of wild grazers and mixed feeders.

TI  - First Look Into the Ambrosia Beetle-Fungus Symbiosis Present in Commercial Avocado Orchards in Michoacan, Mexico
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - Most beetle-fungus symbioses do not represent a threat to agricultural and natural ecosystems; however, a few beetles are able to inoculate healthy hosts with disease-causing fungal symbionts. Here, we report the putative nutritional symbionts associated with five native species of ambrosia beetles colonizing commercial avocado trees in four locations in Michoacan. Knowing which beetles are present in the commercial orchards and the surrounding areas, as well as their fungal associates, is imperative for developing a realistic risk assessment and an effective monitoring system that allows for timely management actions. Phylogenetic analysis revealed five potentially new, previously undescribed species of Raffaelea, and three known species (R. arxi, R. brunnea, R. fusca). The genus Raffaelea was recovered from all the beetle species and across the different locations. Raffaelea lauricola (RL), which causes a deadly vascular fungal disease known as laurel wilt (LW) in Lauraceae species, including avocado, was not recovered. This study points to the imminent danger of native ambrosia beetles spreading RL if the pathogen is introduced to Mexico's avocado orchards or natural areas given that these beetles are associated with Raffaelea species and that lateral transfer of RL among ambrosia beetles in Florida suggests that the likelihood of this phenomenon increases when partners are phylogenetically close. Therefore, this study provides important information about the potential vectors of RL in Mexico and other avocado producing regions. Confirming beetle-fungal identities in these areas is especially important given the serious threat laurel wilt disease represents to the avocado industry in Mexico.

TI  - Machine learning-enabled analysis of product distribution and composition in biomass-coal co-pyrolysis
T2  - FUEL
AB  - Co-pyrolysis of biomass and coal presents a promising opportunity for large-scale biomass utilization while reducing fossil fuel consumption. However, this process is highly complex and influenced by various factors, including the physicochemical properties of biomass and coal, their blending ratio, and operating parameters. To effectively comprehend and optimize the biomass-coal co-pyrolysis process, many experiments are required to achieve the desired product quantity and quality. In addressing this challenge, machine learning technology emerges as a valuable solution, as it can learn the relationships between input and output variables from available examples without explicit knowledge of the underlying mechanisms. This study conducts a comprehensive literature review to establish an extensive database encompassing biomass-coal compositions and pyrolysis reaction conditions. Using the collected data, robust statistical analyses are applied to understand better the underlying mechanisms governing the biomass-coal co-pyrolysis process. Four machine learning methods, namely support vector regression, artificial neural network, random forest regression, and gradient boosting regression, are employed to model the process. The best-performing model is subjected to an extensive feature importance analysis to identify the essential input features associated with each output response. The gradient boosting regression technique demonstrates superior performance with excellent results, characterized by higher coefficients of determination (R-2 > 0.96) and lower errors (RMSE < 3.01 and MAE < 2.27). The temperature range of 450 to 550 ?, biomass blending ratios between 30 and 60%, and heating rates of 30 to 50 ?/min were identified as the conditions that maximize pyrolysis oil yield. Furthermore, the feature importance analysis reveals that the operating temperature and the biomass blending ratio are the most significant descriptors in the biomass-coal co-pyrolysis process.

TI  - Whither rice health in the lowlands of Asia: Shifts in production situations, injury profiles, and yields
T2  - PLANT PATHOLOGY
AB  - Emphasizing connectedness among the many elements of plant-based systems that are collectively addressed in One Health is a logical outcome of debates generated by the International Year of Plant Health. The notion of One Health was implemented through the joint use of the concepts of production situation (PS)-the "rice way of life"-and injury profile (IP)-rice health (pathogens, animal pests, and weeds)-in a population of 1051 rice farmers' fields surveyed from 1987 to 2011. Seven associated PSs and nine IPs are characterized. An ending Green Revolution (Period 1) and a post-Green Revolution (Period 2) are considered. Major changes in PSs and IPs occurred, with increased mineral fertilizer inputs, pesticide applications, and landscape uniformity, along with shortening fallow periods, and dropping labour. Increases or decreases in some injuries lead to shifts in IPs towards more frequent bacterial, flower, and panicle diseases. Yield gain between the two periods was marginal but yield losses to IPs remained unchanged. Yet there was an increase by 77.0%, 21.6%, and 439% for insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides, respectively, along with a 27.9% increase in mineral fertilizer inputs. Total factor productivity in rice production dropped by over 40% during the 24 intervening years, not accounting for the long-term effects of these changes on soil fertility, biodiversity, and scarcer water resource. These results call for urgently required reassessment of public efforts to safeguard these agrosystems that are of critical importance economically, socially, and culturally for roughly half the world's population.

TI  - Pests and diseases in agroforestry systems of the humid tropics
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB  - Few studies have included detailed investigations of the interactions of agroforestry techniques with pests and diseases, although the relevance of such interactions has long been recognized. The objectives of this review are to provide basic information on pests and diseases in tropical agroforestry systems and to develop concepts which can assist in the future in the systematic data collection and analysis in this field. The emphasis is on simultaneous agroforestry systems with annual and perennial crops, although rotational systems are also discussed. Crop rotation is an important pest and disease control strategy in annual cropping systems, and the principle of altering host with non-host plants can also be applied in improved fallow systems, provided that hosts of crop pests and diseases are avoided when selecting the fallow species. When annual cropping systems are transformed into simultaneous agroforestry, the control strategy of frequent disturbance of pest and disease populations is to some extent substituted for the strategy of increased stability and internal control mechanisms. However, reduced pest and disease risk is not automatically achieved by introducing perennial plants and increasing the plant diversity in a system. If plant species are introduced that harbor pests or diseases of other species in the system, the risk of pest and disease outbreaks may actually increase. For evaluating such risks, it is important to consider host-ranges of diseases on the pathovar instead of the species level. Beside the selection of compatible plant species, their spatial arrangement may be important for reducing the spread of pest and disease organisms through the system, although little information is available on such effects, and they may be largely irrelevant for organisms with efficient dispersal mechanisms such as wind-dispersed fungi. In addition to the species-specific, 'biological' effects of plants on pests and diseases, their unspecific, 'physical' effects can be of major relevance for pest and disease development as well as the susceptibility of the affected plant species. Increased pest and disease incidence has often been observed directly at the tree-crop interface, caused by the humid microclimate, physical protection of mammal and bird pests by the trees and eventually reduced pest and disease tolerance of competition-stressed crops. Linear tree plantings and hedgerows affect the wind transport of small insects and disease propagules, the active immigration and emigration of pest organisms as well as the populations of natural enemies. Similarly, overhead shade has a major effect on the micro- climatic conditions under which pest and disease organisms, their natural enemies and the crops themselves develop, and its optimization is a highly efficient control strategy for many pests and diseases. On infertile soils, the susceptibility of crops to pests and diseases is strongly affected by the availability of plant nutrients, which may be influenced by agroforestry techniques in various ways. Soil management measures such as mulching and planting cover crops may affect crop health by improving soil fertility and by directly acting on pest and disease populations. The importance of a more systematic collection of pest and disease related information for agroforestry, e.g., in a central database, and of the development of strategies for reducing pest and disease risks in agroforestry in cooperation with farmers is stressed.

TI  - Modelling the invasion dynamics of the African citrus psyllid: The role of human-mediated dispersal and urban and peri-urban citrus trees
T2  - NEOBIOTA
AB  - The African citrus psyllid, Trioza erytreae (Del Guercio) (Hemiptera, Triozidae), is native to tropical Africa and invasive species in North America and Europe. The main host plants are citrus, displaying a preference for lemon trees. This psyllid was recently detected in the northwest region of the Iberian Peninsula, both in Spain and Portugal. Here, we used a model combining a reaction-diffusion model to a stochastic longdistance dispersal model to simulate the invasion dynamics of T. erytreae in Portugal. The psyllid spread in Portugal was simulated between 2015 and 2021 for different combinations of model parameters: two fecundity levels; spread with and without stochastic long-distance dispersal; single or two introductions of T. erytreae; and considering or not the urban and peri-urban citrus trees, besides citrus orchards, estimated using Google Street view imagery. The incorporation of long-distance human mediated dispersal significantly improved the F1-score in the model validation using the official reports as the observed data. Concomitantly, the dispersal rate of T. erytreae in Portugal was on average about 66 km/year, whereas removing long-distance dispersal events, the observed mean was 7.8 +/- 0.3 km/year. The dispersal was mainly towards the south along the coastline, where human population is concentrated. The inclusion of the estimated citrus trees outside orchards areas significantly increased the F1-score in the model validation, revealing the importance these isolated host plants hold as stepping stones for the species current invasion and possibly for other species alike.

TI  - Role of CRPs in tasar sector: Present status and future strategies
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY
CP  - National Symposium on Vanya Sericulture: Opportunities Galore
AB  - Aim: Employ of CRPs for utilization in tasar sericulture by needy organizations under various government schemes / developmental projects.
   Methodology: Community Resource Persons were nurtured under ISDS (Integrated Skill Development Scheme) of CSB and MKSP Tasar projects as a sector specialist cadre who works as specialist of knowing the cutting edge technologies of tasar culture and they will bring the theory of change further to unskilled community to build their skills and creating awareness about the new scientific practices of Tasar Sericulture and building their vision and understanding around communes. CRPs were trained collectively by PRADAN and CSB. Selection of beneficiaries, organizing them into Tasar Vikas Samities (TVSs), signing of agreement with beneficiaries, support for developing infrastructure, etc., during early period of the project, to get maximum project output and keep the tribal's interested in Tasar culture, utilization of the existing Tasar food plants in the forest areas/ raised under other schemes, Skill up-gradation, handholding support to the beneficiaries in creating activity groups were the primary activities achieved by engaging Community Resource Persons (CRP). Disease monitoring, technological support, etc., were monitored by these groups of resource person's.
   Results: A meticulous and customized evaluation programme of the CRPs was accomplished during 2022-23. A total of 479 CRPs nurtured under the special projects in the states of Jharkhand, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Odisha and West Bengal, were accredited jointly by CTRTI Ranchi, Birsa Agricultural University Ranchi, KVKs and TDF-PRADAN Deoghar at field level. CRPs from 05 states covering 18 districts, 46 blocks, and 248 villages consisting 340 males & 139 females participated in evaluation & accreditation of CRPs. It was found that 36.74 percentage of CRP's had expertise in rearing activities followed by grainage and rearing (33.40%) and grainage (11.27%), however; only 8.56 % of the CRP's had their expertise in post cocoon technology. The results of assessment of Community Resource Persons (CRPs) based on different criteria revealed that the CRP's having expertise in both grainage & rearing scored 35.95 which is highest among the CRP's. Whereas lowest score of 30.65 was noticed with the CRP's who had expertise in Grainage. With respect to different criteria for assessment of the CRP's expertise in Tropical Tasar under the criteria of timeliness and sincerity; CRP's scored 7.07 out of 10 score followed by community mobilization (6.83) & on field technology support (6.79).
   Interpretation: As Tasar sector has attracted attention of many funding agencies in the recent past, keeping in view the need of horizontal expansion and shortage of manpower with the State Sericulture departments and others parallel institutions, CRPs can play a vital role based on their skill sets for further utilization by needy organizations under various government schemes/developmental projects.

TI  - Sleeping site ecology, but not sex, affect ecto- and hemoparasite risk, in sympatric, arboreal primates (<i>Avahi occidentalis</i> and <i>Lepilemur edwardsi</i>)
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ZOOLOGY
AB  - Background: A central question in evolutionary parasitology is to what extent ecology impacts patterns of parasitism in wild host populations. In this study, we aim to disentangle factors influencing the risk of parasite exposure by exploring the impact of sleeping site ecology on infection with ectoparasites and vector-borne hemoparasites in two sympatric primates endemic to Madagascar. Both species live in the same dry deciduous forest of northwestern Madagascar and cope with the same climatic constraints, they are arboreal, nocturnal, cat-sized and pair-living but differ prominently in sleeping site ecology. The Western woolly lemur (Avahi occidentalis) sleeps on open branches and frequently changes sleeping sites, whereas the Milne-Edward's sportive lemur (Lepilemur edwardsi) uses tree holes, displaying strong sleeping site fidelity. Sleeping in tree holes should confer protection from mosquito-borne hemoparasites, but should enhance the risk for ectoparasite infestation with mites and nest-adapted ticks. Sex may affect parasite risk in both species comparably, with males bearing a higher risk than females due to an immunosuppressive effect of higher testosterone levels in males or to sex-specific behavior. To explore these hypotheses, ectoparasites and blood samples were collected from 22 individuals of A. occidentalis and 26 individuals of L. edwardsi during the dry and rainy season.
   Results: L. edwardsi, but not A. occidentalis, harbored ectoparasites, namely ticks (Haemaphysalis lemuris [Ixodidae], Ornithodoros sp. [Argasidae]) and mites (Aetholaelaps trilyssa, [Laelapidae]), suggesting that sleeping in tree holes promotes infestation with ectoparasites. Interestingly, ectoparasites were found solely in the hot, rainy season with a prevalence of 75% (N = 16 animals). Blood smears were screened for the presence and infection intensity of hemoparasites. Microfilariae were detected in both species. Morphological characteristics suggested that each lemur species harbored two different filarial species. Prevalence of microfilarial infection was significantly lower in L. edwardsi than in A. occidentalis. No significant difference in infection intensity between the two host species, and no effect of season, daytime of sampling or sex on prevalence or infection intensity was found. In neither host species, parasite infection showed an influence on body weight as an indicator for body condition.
   Conclusions: Our findings support that sleeping site ecology affects ectoparasite infestation in nocturnal, arboreal mammalian hosts in the tropics, whereas there is no significant effect of host sex. The influence of sleeping site ecology to vector-borne hemoparasite risk is less pronounced. The observed parasite infections did not affect body condition and thus may be of minor importance for shaping reproductive fitness. Findings provide first evidence for the specific relevance of sleeping site ecology on parasitism in arboreal and social mammals. Further, our results increase the sparse knowledge on ecological drivers of primate host-parasite interactions and transmission pathways in natural tropical environments.

TI  - Hidden Population Structure and Cross-species Transmission of Whipworms (<i>Trichuris</i> sp.) in Humans and Non-human Primates in Uganda
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background: Whipworms (Trichuris sp.) are a globally distributed genus of parasitic helminths that infect a diversity of mammalian hosts. Molecular methods have successfully resolved porcine whipworm, Trichuris suis, from primate whipworm, T. trichiura. However, it remains unclear whether T. trichiura is a multi-host parasite capable of infecting a wide taxonomic breadth of primate hosts or a complex of host specific parasites that infect one or two closely related hosts.
   Methods and Findings: We examined the phylogenetic structure of whipworms in a multi-species community of non-human primates and humans in Western Uganda, using both traditional microscopy and molecular methods. A newly developed nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method applied to non-invasively collected fecal samples detected Trichuris with 100% sensitivity and 97% specificity relative to microscopy. Infection rates varied significantly among host species, from 13.3% in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) to 88.9% in olive baboons (Papio anubis). Phylogenetic analyses based on nucleotide sequences of the Trichuris internal transcribed spacer regions 1 and 2 of ribosomal DNA revealed three co-circulating Trichuris groups. Notably, one group was detected only in humans, while another infected all screened host species, indicating that whipworms from this group are transmitted among wild primates and humans.
   Conclusions and Significance: Our results suggest that the host range of Trichuris varies by taxonomic group, with some groups showing host specificity, and others showing host generality. In particular, one Trichuris taxon should be considered a multi-host pathogen that is capable of infecting wild primates and humans. This challenges past assumptions about the host specificity of this and similar helminth parasites and raises concerns about animal and human health.

TI  - Spatial analysis of G.f.fuscipes abundance in Uganda using Poisson and Zero-Inflated Poisson regression models
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - BackgroundTsetse flies are the major vectors of human trypanosomiasis of the form Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense and T.b.gambiense. They are widely spread across the sub-Saharan Africa and rendering a lot of challenges to both human and animal health. This stresses effective agricultural production and productivity in Africa. Delimiting the extent and magnitude of tsetse coverage has been a challenge over decades due to limited resources and unsatisfactory technology. In a bid to overcome these limitations, this study attempted to explore modelling skills that can be applied to spatially estimate tsetse abundance in the country using limited tsetse data and a set of remote-sensed environmental variables. MethodologyEntomological data for the period 2008-2018 as used in the model were obtained from various sources and systematically assembled using a structured protocol. Data harmonisation for the purposes of responsiveness and matching was carried out. The key tool for tsetse trapping was itemized as pyramidal trap in many instances and biconical trap in others. Based on the spatially explicit assembled data, we ran two regression models; standard Poisson and Zero-Inflated Poisson (ZIP), to explore the associations between tsetse abundance in Uganda and several environmental and climatic covariates. The covariate data were constituted largely by satellite sensor data in form of meteorological and vegetation surrogates in association with elevation and land cover data. We finally used the Zero-Inflated Poisson (ZIP) regression model to predict tsetse abundance due to its superiority over the standard Poisson after model fitting and testing using the Vuong Non-Nested statistic. ResultsA total of 1,187 tsetse sampling points were identified and considered as representative for the country. The model results indicated the significance and level of responsiveness of each covariate in influencing tsetse abundance across the study area. Woodland vegetation, elevation, temperature, rainfall, and dry season normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) were important in determining tsetse abundance and spatial distribution at varied scales. The resultant prediction map shows scaled tsetse abundance with estimated fitted numbers ranging from 0 to 59 flies per trap per day (FTD). Tsetse abundance was found to be largest at low elevations, in areas of high vegetative activity, in game parks, forests and shrubs during the dry season. There was very limited responsiveness of selected predictors to tsetse abundance during the wet season, matching the known fact that tsetse disperse most significantly during wet season. ConclusionsA methodology was advanced to enable compilation of entomological data for 10 years, which supported the generation of tsetse abundance maps for Uganda through modelling. Our findings indicate the spatial distribution of the G. f. fuscipes as; low 0-5 FTD (48%), medium 5.1-35 FTD (18%) and high 35.1-60 FTD (34%) grounded on seasonality. This approach, amidst entomological data shortages due to limited resources and absence of expertise, can be adopted to enable mapping of the vector to provide better decision support towards designing and implementing targeted tsetse and tsetse-transmitted African trypanosomiasis control strategies.
   Author summaryTsetse flies are the major vectors of human and animal trypanosomiasis. To support control efforts, there is need to understand the location of these vectors in terms of distribution and abundance. Due to limited resources and unsatisfactory technology, delimiting the extent and magnitude of tsetse coverage remains a challenge. In a bid to overcome these limitations, this study attempted to explore modelling skills that can be applied to inform decision makers about the status of tsetse abundance using limited historical tsetse data and a set of remote-sensed environmental variables. Two regression models; standard Poisson and Zero-Inflated Poisson (ZIP) were fitted and evaluated for superiority. The results indicated the level of responsiveness of each covariate in influencing the vector across the study area. Tsetse abundance was found to be largest at low elevations in areas of high vegetative activity, in game parks, forests and permanently flooded shrubs during the dry season. This approach can be adopted to enable mapping of any tsetse species to provide better decision support towards designing and implementing targeted tsetse and tsetse-transmitted African trypanosomiasis control strategies amidst entomological data shortages due to limited resources and absence of expertise.

TI  - Invasion success of the large hairy armadillo <i>(Chaetophractus villosus)</i> in a sub-antarctic insular ecosystem (Isla Grande, Tierra del Fuego, Argentina)
T2  - POLAR BIOLOGY
AB  - The large hairy armadillo (Chaetophractus villosus) was introduced to the Isla Grande of Tierra del Fuego almost 35 years ago. Previous studies described the armadillo's distribution relative to heated oil pipelines. The present study updates this distribution, and evaluates associations with additional environmental variables to better explain the dispersion process and to propose areas for the control/eradication of this invasive species. We conducted 52 random transects looking for indirect evidence of the presence of C. villosus such as burrows and "foraging pits". We looked for associations between the presence/habitat use of armadillos with local environmental characteristics and landscape features. We also gathered information about the invasion process through interviews with rural settlers. The species' distribution was calculated with the Minimum Convex Polygon method, and a linear invasion rate was calculated. Finally, a map with priority areas for eradication was developed. Armadillos occur in areas with tall and medium-height vegetation and avoid low and floodable terrains. Signs of armadillo presence were more abundant in areas with humic soils but were not associated with any landscape features. The distribution of C. villosus increased by 4735.92 km(2) in 12 years with an average linear expansion rate of 10.91 km/year. Humans seem to have facilitated the spread of armadillos towards the south. Implementation of any control measures should be focused on two areas of the island: namely those with high terrains, medium/high vegetation height and humic soils. This invasion represents a socio-ecological problem that needs full and urgent attention while eradication is still feasible.

TI  - Global Warming Status in the African Continent: Sources, Challenges, Policies, and Future Direction
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB  - Africa is the second largest continent after Asia, having a larger than 30 million km(2) area. Doubtlessly, one of the biggest ecological and societal problems of the twenty-first century is climate change. Since the early 1970s, it has been clear that Africa is already experiencing the effects of climate change, and it has given rise to a wide range of new and unusual phenomena, such as rising temperatures, poor agricultural output, extreme different weather scenarios, and the spread of disease, among other things. Therefore, the current review aims at screening the impact of climate change on agricultural sector, human health and food security in Africa compared to the other continents, evaluating the change projections in future and highlighting the role of African leaders in mitigating and adapting to these effects. Artificial intelligence, remote sensing, and high-tech algorithms were applied to analyze these effects. Historical data were downloaded in near real-time from January 2009 to the present from the FAO Water Productivity Open-access portal WaPOR and Terra Climate datasets on Earth Engine platform. Assessment process was performed using Google Earth Engine, whereas future data were downloaded from WorldClim 2.1. We used 2021-2040 timelines and two scenarios: SSP245 and SSP585. For the SSP and timeline, we downloaded four versions, based on four different global circulation models (GCMs): IPSL-CM6A-LR (France), MRI-ESM2-0 (Japan), CanESM5 (Canadian), and BCC-CSM2-MR (China), to reflect the uncertainty among GCMs. We averaged future projection of each variable and SSP across four GCMs to decrease the uncertainty connected with a particular GCM. We presented the averaged results as maps. Annual precipitation totals were significantly above average in Central and East Africa, while under SSP 245 scenario, Madagascar would experience high rainfall. The highest temperature anomalies were seen in parts of the Greater Horn of Africa, western equatorial regions, and the north-western part of the continent. Minimum and Maximum temperature predictions showed that Africa would experience harsh temperatures than previously recorded in the historical years. A high average maximum temperature is predicted across the sub-Sahara Africa, South Africa, Somalia, and Madagascar under SSP 245 and SSP 585. The MCD64A1 dataset tagged in Earth Engine was used to classify forest fire risk in Africa. Analysis revealed that the highest fire risk was recorded in Savannah in tropical and subtropical Africa. Further, changes in rainfall and increased temperature leading to increased evaporation would directly reduce runoff levels and recharge groundwater which in turn will have negative effects on biodiversity, agriculture, and food security. Notably, African leaders have played positive role in the recent climate negotiations and bright climate initiatives have been emerged. Hopefully they will solve the climate crisis across the continent.

TI  - Integrated management of eucalyptus bacterial wilt in Sumatra, Indonesia
T2  - TROPICAL PLANT PATHOLOGY
AB  - Bacterial wilt is one of the most destructive plant diseases and responsible for great losses in eucalyptus plantations worldwide. Since the use of highly productive monoclonal stands became a common practice in forest companies, the industry have experienced severe bacterial wilt outbreaks. Thus, the present study aimed to provide alternative methods that can be incorporated in the management of bacterial wilt of eucalyptus in Sumatra, Indonesia. Pathogen identification with molecular markers, effect of plant propagation on the disease incidence, chemical sterilization of sand beds, antibacterial activity, and genetic resistance of eucalyptus clones were evaluated. Colonies obtained from diseased plants were morphologically indistinguishable, but specific primers 759F/760R and sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA gene confirmed the pathogen identity as Ralstonia pseudosolanacearum. In-field evaluation showed that plants propagated via mini-cuttings had the highest disease incidence, 16.5%, while the tissue culture plants rooted in-vitro had the lowest disease incidence, 3%. Chemical sterilization of sand beds with NaOCl and H2O2 was effective on reducing bacterial cells by 97 and 42%, respectively. In-vitro assays confirmed the antibacterial activity of oxolinic acid and streptomycin by promoting a clear zone of 1.3 and 1.4 cm in diameter, respectively. The susceptibility to bacterial wilt varied among eucalyptus genotypes, and of the 21 clones tested eight were resistant, nine were moderate and four were susceptible. Therefore, an effective management of eucalyptus bacterial wilt can be achieved by combining all methods used in this study with best practices used in commercial nurseries and plantations.

TI  - Tumor cytotoxicity of leucurolysin-B, a P-III snake venom metalloproteinase from <i>Bothrops leucurus</i>
T2  - JOURNAL OF VENOMOUS ANIMALS AND TOXINS INCLUDING TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Although it has been demonstrated that venoms and toxins from some snakes are able to influence the growth of tumor cells, few antitumoral compounds from Bothrops leucurus venom have been characterized. Leucurolysin-B (leuc-B) is a metalloproteinase class P-III isolated from B. leucurus which possesses an ECD-disintegrin domain. Both ECD-disentegrin and RGD-disintegrin are able to bind to cell surface integrins and inhibit their adherence to their natural ligands. In the present study, the potential efficacy and the cytotoxic effects of leuc-B on glioblastoma, breast cancer and melanoma cell lines were analyzed. The effect of leuc-B on cancer cell survival was evaluated and its 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) was determined. Morphological alterations were monitored by contrast phase and fluorescent microscopy. The results demonstrated that leuc-B has potent cytotoxic effect in a micromolar range against all evaluated cancer cell lines. Morphologically, dying cells showed fragmentation, condensation of their contents concomitant with shrinkage and appearance of vacuoles. This study reports for the first time the cytotoxic effect of leuc-B from B. leucurus snake venom on tumor cells.

TI  - Bromodomain factor 5 is an essential regulator of transcription in <i>Leishmania</i>
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB  - Leishmania are unicellular parasites that cause human and animal diseases. Like other kinetoplastids, they possess large transcriptional start regions (TSRs) which are defined by histone variants and histone lysine acetylation. Cellular interpretation of these chromatin marks is not well understood. Eight bromodomain factors, the reader modules for acetyl-lysine, are found across Leishmania genomes. Using L. mexicana, Cas9-driven gene deletions indicate that BDF1-5 are essential for promastigotes. Dimerisable, split Cre recombinase (DiCre)-inducible gene deletion of BDF5 show it is essential for both promastigotes and murine infection. ChIP-seq identifies BDF5 as enriched at TSRs. XL-BioID proximity proteomics shows the BDF5 landscape is enriched for BDFs, HAT2, proteins involved in transcriptional activity, and RNA processing; revealing a Conserved Regulators of Kinetoplastid Transcription (CRKT) Complex. Inducible deletion of BDF5 causes global reduction in RNA polymerase II transcription. Our results indicate the requirement of Leishmania to interpret histone acetylation marks through the bromodomain-enriched CRKT complex for normal gene expression and cellular viability.
   Leishmania use large (5-10 kb) transcriptional start regions, where the chromatin is highly enriched for acetylated histones, to drive the expression of polycistronic gene arrays. Here the authors show bromodomain-containing protein BDF5 is enriched at transcriptional start sites and its depletion leads to cell death in vitro and in murine infections, and they identify its interactors.

TI  - <i>Aedes albopictus </i>bionomics data collection by citizen participation on Procida Island, a promising Mediterranean site for the assessment of innovative and community-based integrated pest management methods
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Author summaryMosquitoes represent a nuisance as well as public health risk due to their ability to transmit pathogens to humans. The Asian tiger mosquito Aedes albopictus is an invasive species nowadays established in all Mediterranean countries, reaching highest abundance in Italy. Innovative control approaches have been proposed to complement conventional ones and to increase the success of the fight against this aggressive day-biting species, but still need to be validated in the field. Small islands are ideal places for these validation experiments as they are naturally protected by the spill over of mosquitoes from neighbouring untreated areas. The island of Procida, in the gulf of Naples (Italy), has the right ecological characteristics (e.g., homogeneous landscape and high densities of human and Ae. albopictus populations) to represent an ideal experimental site. In collaboration with the Municipality and the residents we obtained relevant data on the mosquito distribution and seasonality on the island and performed preliminary experiments, creating an instrumental baseline information which will facilitate the effective testing of novel control schemes.
   In the last decades, the colonization of Mediterranean Europe and of other temperate regions by Aedes albopictus created an unprecedented nuisance problem in highly infested areas and new public health threats due to the vector competence of the species. The Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) and the Incompatible Insect Technique (IIT) are insecticide-free mosquito-control methods, relying on mass release of irradiated/manipulated males, able to complement existing and only partially effective control tools. The validation of these approaches in the field requires appropriate experimental settings, possibly isolated to avoid mosquito immigration from other infested areas, and preliminary ecological and entomological data. We carried out a 4-year study in the island of Procida (Gulf of Naples, Italy) in strict collaboration with local administrators and citizens to estimate the temporal dynamics, spatial distribution, and population size of Ae. albopictus and the dispersal and survival of irradiated males. We applied ovitrap monitoring, geo-spatial analyses, mark-release-recapture technique, and a citizen-science approach. Results allow to predict the seasonal (from April to October, with peaks of 928-9,757 males/ha) and spatial distribution of the species, highlighting the capacity of Ae. albopictus population of Procida to colonize and maintain high frequencies in urban as well as in sylvatic inhabited environments. Irradiated males shown limited ability to disperse (mean daily distance travelled <60m) and daily survival estimates ranging between 0.80 and 0.95. Overall, the ecological characteristics of the island, the acquired knowledge on Ae. albopictus spatial and temporal distribution, the high human and Ae. albopictus densities and the positive attitude of the resident population in being active parts in innovative mosquito control projects provide the ground for evidence-based planning of the interventions and for the assessment of their effectiveness. In addition, the results highlight the value of creating synergies between research groups, local administrators, and citizens for affordable monitoring (and, in the future, control) of mosquito populations.

TI  - Isolation and biochemical characterization of bradykinin-potentiating peptides from <i>Bitis gabonica rhinoceros</i>
T2  - JOURNAL OF VENOMOUS ANIMALS AND TOXINS INCLUDING TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background: Venoms represent a still underexplored reservoir of bioactive components that might mitigate or cure diseases in conditions in which conventional therapy is ineffective. The bradykinin-potentiating peptides (BPPs) comprise a class of angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. The BPPs usually consist of oligopeptides with 5 to 13 residues with a high number of proline residues and the tripeptide Ile-Pro-Pro (IPP-tripeptide) in the C-terminus region and have a conserved N-terminal pyroglutamate residue. As a whole, the action of the BPPs on prey and snakebite victims results in the decrease of the blood pressure. The aim of this work was to isolate and characterize novel BPPs from the venom of Bitis gabonica rhinoceros.
   Methods: The crude venom of B.g. rhinoceros was fractionated by size exclusion chromatography and the peptide fraction (<7 kDa) was separated by reverse phase chromatography (RP-HPLC) and analyzed by ESI-IT-TOF-MS/MS. One new BPP was identified, synthetized and assayed for ACE inhibition and, in vivo, for edema potentiation.
   Results: Typical BPP signatures were identified in three RP-HPLC fractions. CID fragmentation presented the usual y-ion of the terminal P-P fragment as a predominant signal at m/z 213.1. De novo peptide sequencing identified one Bothrops-like BPP and one new BPP sequence. The new BPP was synthesized and showed poor inhibition over ACE, but displayed significant bradykinin-induced edema potentiation.
   Conclusions: So far, few BPPs are described in Viperinae, and based on the sequenced peptides, two non-canonical sequences were detected. The possible clinical role of this new peptides remains unclear.

TI  - Using the artificial bee colony technique to optimize machine learning algorithms in estimating the mature weight of camels
T2  - TROPICAL ANIMAL HEALTH AND PRODUCTION
AB  - This paper aims to predict male and female camels' mature weight (MW) through various morphological traits using hybrid machine learning (ML) algorithms. For this aim, biometrical measurements such as birth weight (BW), length of face (FL), length of the neck (NL), a girth of the heart (HG), body length (BL), withers height (WH), and hind leg length (HLL) were used to estimate the mature weight for eight camel breeds of Pakistan. In this study, multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) were applied to develop prediction models. Furthermore, the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm is employed to optimize ML models' internal parameters and improve prediction accuracy. The predictive performance of ML and hybrid models was evaluated on a testing dataset using goodness-of-fit measures such as mean absolute deviation (MAD), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), coefficient of determination (R-2), and root mean square error (RMSE). The results of the study revealed the ABC-SVM model was the best predictive model. The experimental results of this study showed that the proposed ABC-SVM method could effectively improve the accuracy for MW prediction of camels, thus having a research and practical value.

TI  - Spatial distribution of <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> in cows and associated risk factors
T2  - TROPICAL ANIMAL HEALTH AND PRODUCTION
AB  - The aim of the present study was to evaluate the spatial distribution of the prevalence of T. gondii in cows using the indirect immunofluorescence assay and determine associated risk factors. Serum samples were collected from 2970 cows on 263 rural farms in 223 municipalities. A questionnaire was administered to herd owners to collect data for the evaluation of risk factors associated with this disease. Mean seroprevalence of T. gondii in cows was 8.48% (95% CI: 7.48 to 9.49). The microregions with the greatest likelihood (p <= 0.05) of having infected animals were Anapolis, Ceres, SAo Miguel do Araguaia, the Federal District, Anicuns, and VAo do Parana. The purchase of females or males for reproductive/breeding purposes was significantly associated (p <= 0.05) with the prevalence of T. gondii in these regions. A positive correlation (0.7618; p=0.047) was found between the prevalence of T. gondii and total area in hectares of forests in these regions, suggesting that wild cats may be disseminating T. gondii at these sites. The present results highlight the importance of considering the meat from these animals to be an important infection route for humans who eat raw or undercooked food.

TI  - Explaining the Host-Finding Behavior of Blood-Sucking Insects: Computerized Simulation of the Effects of Habitat Geometry on Tsetse Fly Movement
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background: Male and female tsetse flies feed exclusively on vertebrate blood. While doing so they can transmit the diseases of sleeping sickness in humans and nagana in domestic stock. Knowledge of the host-orientated behavior of tsetse is important in designing bait methods of sampling and controlling the flies, and in understanding the epidemiology of the diseases. For this we must explain several puzzling distinctions in the behavior of the different sexes and species of tsetse. For example, why is it that the species occupying savannahs, unlike those of riverine habitats, appear strongly responsive to odor, rely mainly on large hosts, are repelled by humans, and are often shy of alighting on baits?
   Methodology/Principal Findings: A deterministic model that simulated fly mobility and host-finding success suggested that the behavioral distinctions between riverine, savannah and forest tsetse are due largely to habitat size and shape, and the extent to which dense bushes limit occupiable space within the habitats. These factors seemed effective primarily because they affect the daily displacement of tsetse, reducing it by up to similar to 70%. Sex differences in behavior are explicable by females being larger and more mobile than males.
   Conclusion/Significance: Habitat geometry and fly size provide a framework that can unify much of the behavior of all sexes and species of tsetse everywhere. The general expectation is that relatively immobile insects in restricted habitats tend to be less responsive to host odors and more catholic in their diet. This has profound implications for the optimization of bait technology for tsetse, mosquitoes, black flies and tabanids, and for the epidemiology of the diseases they transmit.

TI  - Correlates of Late Presentation to HIV care in a South Indian Cohort
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Late presentation to healthcare by HIV infected patients' is common in India despite access to free combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). We assessed risk factors for late presentation among patients with a recent HIV diagnosis in an academic university-based antiretroviral treatment center. This retrospective study included 474 recently diagnosed HIV-infected patients registered for cART between 2012 and 2013. Subjects with CD4(+) T-lymphocyte (CD4) count <= 350 cells/mu L or with an AIDS defining event were defined as late presenters (LP) and patients with CD4 count <= 200 cells/mu L or with an AIDS defining event were defined as LP with advanced HIV disease (LPAD). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to investigate factors associated with late presentation. Of the 474 patients, 356 (75.1%) were LP. Of these, 299 (83.99%) were LPAD and 57 (16.01%) LP were AIDS-free. Median CD4 count among LP was 134 cells/mu L (interquartile range 72.25-219). Mean age of LP was 42.50 +/- 8.88 years; 256 (71.9%) were males. Increasing age (>51 years; Adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 4.19; P = 0.014) and rural residence (aOR 3.19; P = < 0.001) were independently associated with late presentation. HIV-positive housewives (aOR 0.34; P = 0.027), HIV-positive individuals with negative partners (aOR 0.48; P = 0.006), and partners with unknown HIV status (aOR 0.43; P = 0.007) were less likely to present late compared with positive partners of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). Most patients were LP despite free access to cART. Rural population and older PLWHA should be targeted while implementing HIV care. There is a need to strengthen the HIV care cascade by linking PLWHA to cART immediately after diagnosis.

TI  - Phlebotomines (Diptera: Psychodidae) and Mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) Surrounding an Environmental Protection Zone in the Metropolitan Region of Natal: Use of Light-Emitting Diode (LED) Bulbs in Entomological Surveillance
T2  - NEOTROPICAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - Entomological surveillance is very important for parasite and arbovirus vector control programs. Light traps with incandescent bulbs are used to attract insects and analyze the factors that contribute to the occurrence of species surrounding an environmental protection zone. Phlebotomine and mosquito abundance and their diversity were analyzed. Captures occurred monthly using six CDC light traps with two incandescent bulbs, two blue and two red LED lights. A total of 2211 phlebotomines of seven species and 4486 mosquitoes belonging to 20 taxa were captured. Different phlebotomine and mosquito species were found in the forest and peridomestic environments, with a predominance of the sand flyEvandromyia walkeri(Newstead) and the mosquitoCoquillettidia venezuelensis(Theobald).There was a significant difference in the abundance of sand flies captured with the three bulbs tested, the blue bulb being the most efficient. The Shannon-Wiener diversity index showed that the trap equipped with a red LED light obtained a higher value than that of the blue LED and incandescent bulb. Analyses showed that the potential vectors and non-vectors of the two groups circulate between the forest and the peridomestic environment, suggesting an adaptation process of species to the altered environment. An incandescent light bulb can be substituted by an LED bulb, without compromising the sensitivity of the method. A blue LED is indicated for the abundant capture of mosquitoes and sand flies, while a red LED obtains a better result in terms of species diversity per capture.

TI  - <i>HARPACTOR ANGULOSUS</i> (REDUVIIDAE: HARPACTORINAE), A PREDATOR OF NEOTROPICAL SATURNIIDS, <i>HYLESIA</i> SPP. IN BRAZIL
T2  - ENTOMOLOGICAL NEWS
AB  - Caterpillars of the genus Hylesia (Lepidoptera: Saturniidae: Hemileucinae) can cause agricultural damages and dermatological lesions by direct contact to its urticating bristles. The biological control can regulate populations of these insects, but their natural enemies are poorly known. The occurrence of Harpactor angulosus (Lepeletier and Serville, 1825) (Reduviidae: Harpactorinae) predating caterpillars of Hylesia spp. is described. Adults of this predator were captured in an area of secondary forest in Vicosa, Minas Gerais State, Brazil and their pairs individualized in the field to obtain eggs. Adults of this predator presented sex dimorphism, with smaller males than females. They were found predating caterpillars of Hylesia spp., isolated from others to avoid the aposematic defense of this prey, when grouped. The presence of this predator, in the field, demonstrates its potential for the biological control of defoliating caterpillars. Studies on biological aspects and alimentary habits are important to understand the importance of H. angulosus in the biological control of defoliating caterpillars.

TI  - Prevalence, intensity and associated risk factors of soil transmitted helminth infections: A comparison between Negritos (indigenous) in inland jungle and those in resettlement at town peripheries
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background Formerly known as the Malaysian hunter gatherers, the Negrito Orang Asli (OA) were heavily dependent on the forest for sustenance and early studies indicated high prevalence of intestinal parasitism. Initiation of a redevelopment program in the 1970s aimed to demarginalize the OA was expected to reduce soil transmitted helminth (STH) infections. Gradually, the OA were relocated to new resettlement areas at the peripheries. The aim of this study was to compare STH infections between Negritos who are still living in the inland jungle with those living in resettlements.
   Methodology/Principal findings A total of 416 Negrito participants were grouped into two categories of communities based on location; Inland Jungle Villages (IJV); and Resettlement Plan Scheme (RPS). Iodine wet mount, formalin-ether sedimentation, modified Trichrome and modified Ziehl-Neelsen staining and Kato-Katz methods were performed on stool samples. A questionnaire was used to collect information regarding demographic, socioeconomic, environmental and hygiene behaviors. Prevalence of STH was significantly higher in IJV (91.3%) versus RPS (83.1%) (P = 0.02). However, the percentage of individuals with severe intensity of Trichuris trichiura infections was significantly higher in the RPS (17.2%) compared to IJV (6.5%) (P = 0.01). Severe Ascaris lumbricoides infection was observed at 20.0% amongst RPS Negritos and 15.0% amongst IJV (P = 0.41). Whilst for hookworm infection, both prevalence and individuals with moderate to severe infections were higher in the IJV (26.2%, 41.0%) versus RPS (18.7%, 24.0%) (P values = 0.08, 0.09), accordingly. The prevalence other intestinal parasitic infections (e.g. Entamoeba sp., Blastocystis and flukes) was also higher in IJV versus RPS. Apart from poor hygienic behaviors as significant risk factors in both communities, low socio-economic status was highly associated with STH infections in RPS (P<0.001) but not significantly associated in IJV.
   Conclusions The findings showed that ex situ development plan by RPS has not profoundly contributed to the STH reduction among the OA. Conversely, burden rate of T. trichiura infections increased due to their extreme poverty and poor hygienic behaviors. Here, we are suggesting biannual mass albendazole intervention (triple dose regimens in RPS, but a single dose in IJV) and community empowerment to both communities. For a long-term and better uptake, these strategies must be done together with the community input and participation, respecting their traditional customs and accompanied by recruitment of more OA people in the health-care taskforce.
   Author summary Pattern of diseases in a community are associated with changes of culture, socio-economic and environmental conditions. In Malaysia, while transition towards modernity by socio-economic development has shown significant reduction in intestinal parasitism in the general population, no significant difference was observed among the Orang Asli (indigenous) communities. Nevertheless, since the 1970s, the Malaysian government has initiated the Resettlement Plan Scheme (RPS) to improve health, socio-economic status and education opportunities of the OA. Known as hunter gatherers, the Negritos represent a good model to study the effects of living conditions transition on intestinal parasitism. Like other tribes, they are also undergoing the transition from foraging and gathering practices towards demarginalization primarily by resettlement. Thus, the present study aims to evaluate STH infections in two categories of Negritos; (i) Inland Jungle Villages (IJV) communities, living in the interior forested areas and (ii) the Negritos who have been gathered and relocated to designated settlements closer to towns (RPS). A study to compare the current pattern of STH profiles in terms of prevalence and intensity of infection together with their associated risk factors among these two categories of communities was conducted. Since STHs are still plaguing the OA communities, the information gathering in the present study will be crucial for customizing a cost-effective deworming program involving selection of drug dosages, frequency of administration, type of modalities and most importantly community inclusion and empowerment programs through health education.

TI  - Oreos Versus Orangutans: The Need for Sustainability Transformations and Nonhierarchical Polycentric Governance in the Global Palm Oil Industry
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - While the myriad benefits of palm oil as a food, makeup, and cleaning product additive drive its demand, globally, the palm oil industry remains largely unsustainable and unregulated. The negative externalities of palm oil production are diverse and devastating to tropical ecosystem integrity and human livelihoods in palm oil nations. Given the current trend in increasing sustainability and transparency in global supply chains, we suggest that sustainability policy reforms are feasible and have the potential to promote 21st century U.S. and international sustainability standards. Polycentric governance may improve the attainment of sustainable global palm oil standards with a set of rules that interact across linear and nonlinear hierarchies and structures, thereby improving collaboration efforts, and increasing connectivity and learning across scales and cultures. Transformations towards sustainability in international palm oil governance has the potential to make valuable contributions to global sustainable development and improve the prosperity of poor rural communities in the tropics by providing a framework for achieving palm oil trade transparency and aligning the sustainability goals across a range of actors.

TI  - Development of a machine learning model for early prediction of plasma leakage in suspected dengue patients
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Author summaryCurrent machine learning approaches are mostly designed for decision support systems that used for predicting severity of dengue and forecasting of dengue cases. The few studies to predict plasma leakage rely on traditional statistical approach with a priori predictors. To our knowledge, no study used machine learning to predict plasma leakage in suspected dengue patients. This is the first study to develop a machine learning model to identify predictors that detect plasma leakage in the early stages of dengue infection. In addition, this study placed focus on a limited resource setting enabling decision support systems to be utilised in the low- to middle-income country of Sri Lanka. The study identified five accessible predictors as inputs to the model to aid the decision making for hospital admission for suspected cases of dengue. Lastly, the multi-metric assessments, model fairness and Shapley additive explanations push the agenda for model transparency and interpretability. Our machine learning approach demonstrated reasonable performance and has the potential to identify patients who are likely to develop plasma leakage for close monitoring to prevent severe consequences.
   BackgroundAt least a third of dengue patients develop plasma leakage with increased risk of life-threatening complications. Predicting plasma leakage using laboratory parameters obtained in early infection as means of triaging patients for hospital admission is important for resource-limited settings. MethodsA Sri Lankan cohort including 4,768 instances of clinical data from N = 877 patients (60.3% patients with confirmed dengue infection) recorded in the first 96 hours of fever was considered. After excluding incomplete instances, the dataset was randomly split into a development and a test set with 374 (70%) and 172 (30%) patients, respectively. From the development set, five most informative features were selected using the minimum description length (MDL) algorithm. Random forest and light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) were used to develop a classification model using the development set based on nested cross validation. An ensemble of the learners via average stacking was used as the final model to predict plasma leakage. ResultsLymphocyte count, haemoglobin, haematocrit, age, and aspartate aminotransferase were the most informative features to predict plasma leakage. The final model achieved the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve, AUC = 0.80 with positive predictive value, PPV = 76.9%, negative predictive value, NPV = 72.5%, specificity = 87.9%, and sensitivity = 54.8% on the test set. ConclusionThe early predictors of plasma leakage identified in this study are similar to those identified in several prior studies that used non-machine learning based methods. However, our observations strengthen the evidence base for these predictors by showing their relevance even when individual data points, missing data and non-linear associations were considered. Testing the model on different populations using these low-cost observations would identify further strengths and limitations of the presented model.

TI  - HABITAT CHARACTERIZATION AND MAPPING OF <i>ANOPHELES MACULATUS</i> (THEOBALD) MOSQUITO LARVAE IN MALARIA ENDEMIC AREAS IN KUALA LIPIS, PAHANG, MALAYSIA
T2  - SOUTHEAST ASIAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - In Peninsular Malaysia, a large proportion of malaria cases occur in the central mountainous and forested parts of the country. As part of a study to assess remote sensing data as a tool for vector mapping, we conducted entomological surveys to determine the type of mosquitoes, their characteristics and the abundance of habitats of the vector Anopheles maculatus in malaria endemic areas in Pos Senderot. An. maculatus mosquitoes were collected from 49 breeding sites in Pos Senderot. An. maculatus preferred to breed in water pockets formed on the bank of rivers and waterfalls. The most common larval habitats were shallow pools 5.0-15.0 cm deep with clear water, mud substrate and plants or floatage. The mosquito also preferred open or partially shaded habitats. Breeding habitats were generally located at 100-400 m from the nearest human settlement. Changes in breeding characteristics were also observed. Instead of breeding in slow flowing streams, most larvae bred in small water pockets along the river margin.

TI  - <i>Ditylenchus gallaeformans</i> sp n. (Tylenchida: Anguinidae) - a neotropical nematode with biocontrol potential against weedy Melastomataceae
T2  - NEMATOLOGY
AB  - Ditylenchus gallaeformans sp. n. was found on several hosts at numerous locations in Brazil and Costa Rica. In its native habitats it attacks several genera in the Melastomataceae, including two species ranked as among the worst invasive weeds of Pacific island forests, namely Miconia calvescens and Clidemia hirta. The new species causes a severe disease on infected plants involving the formation of gall-like structures on infected leaves, inflorescences and stems, and may cause significant impact on its hosts. Morphological study using light and scanning electron microscopy and analysis of the partial 18S rRNA, the D2-D3 expansion fragments of 28S rRNA and the ITS rRNA gene sequences showed little variations between populations from different hosts or geographical origins. The molecular study revealed that the new species is related to D. drepanocercus, which was recently found in association with M. calvescens but causing angular leaf spots on this host. Ditylenchus gallaeformans sp. n. is distinguished from D. drepanocercus by having a bursa reaching the tail tip (vs covering around 50% of tail in D. drepanocercus) and a conical tail, regularly tapering towards a variable tip (vs tail with a distinctive apical falciform appendage in both sexes in D. drepanocercus). PCR with species-specific primers was developed for diagnostics of both Ditylenchus species. Ditylenchus gallaeformans sp. n. deserves further investigation as a potential biocontrol agent against M. calvescens and C. hirta.

TI  - Epidemic malaria in the Menoreh Hills of Central Java
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - After more than 50 years of effective management, resurgent malaria threatens residents in the Menoreh Hills and the foothills of the Dieng Plateau of Central Java, Indonesia. The Dieng Plateau dominates the highland center of Central Java. The steep Menoreh Hills, surrounded by rice paddy habitats, cover approximately 500 km(2) with no peaks greater than 1,000 m. We studied epidemic malaria in Purworejo district, one of the three districts containing the Menoreh Hills. Between 1986 and 1995, the annual parasite incidence (API) in Purworejo ranged from 2 to 11 cases per 1,000 residents per year and was typically approximately 5 per 1,000. In 2000 the API was 44.5. This sharp increase was confined to subdistricts in and around the Menoreh Hills and Dieng Plateau foothills. The primary vectors of malaria, those favoring steep, forested hillsides on Java, were Anopheles maculatus and Anopheles balabacensis. Deterioration of vector control activity, followed by a severe economic downturn in 1997, may explain the epidemic. Malaria in the Menoreh Hills and lower Dieng Plateau threatens surrounding areas of rice paddy inhabited by Anopheles aconitus as well as a nearby coastal habitat where the even more efficient vector Anopheles sundaicus occurs in abundance. Most of the 130 million people living on Java never experienced the hyper- and holoendemic malaria that occurred throughout most of the island before the effective DDT spraying and chloroquine treatment campaigns of the 1950s. Reintroduced endemic malaria threatens the island of Java.

TI  - Spatial distribution of <i>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</i> in South American caecilians
T2  - DISEASES OF AQUATIC ORGANISMS
AB  - The amphibian-killing fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) is linked to population declines in anurans and salamanders globally. To date, however, few studies have attempted to screen Bd in live caecilians; Bd-positive caecilians have only been reported in Africa and French Guiana. Here, we performed a retrospective survey of museum preserved specimens to (1) describe spatial patterns of Bd infection in Gymnophiona across South America and (2) test whether areas of low climatic suitability for Bd in anurans predict Bd spatial epidemiology in caecilians. We used quantitative PCR to detect Bd in preserved caecilians collected over a 109 yr period, and performed autologistic regressions to test the effect of bioclimatic metrics of temperature and precipitation, vegetation density, and elevation on the likelihood of Bd occurrence. We detected an overall Bd prevalence of 12.4%, with positive samples spanning the Uruguayan savanna, Brazil's Atlantic Forest, and the Amazon basin. Our autologistic models detected a strong effect of macroclimate, a weaker effect of vegetation density, and no effect of elevation on the likelihood of Bd occurrence. Although most of our Bd-positive records overlapped with reported areas of high climatic suitability for the fungus in the Neotropics, many of our new Bd-positive samples extend far into areas of poor suitability for Bd in anurans. Our results highlight an important gap in the study of amphibian chytridiomycosis: the potential negative impact of Bd on Neotropical caecilians and the hypothetical role of caecilians as Bd reservoirs.

TI  - Utility of PCR in Patients with <i>Strongyloides</i> <i>stercoralis</i> and HTLV-1 Coinfection in French Guiana
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Strongyloides stercoralis and human T-lymphotropic virus 1 (HTLV-1) coinfections have been extensively reported in the literature, but the diagnosis and treatment of strongyloidiasis remains a challenge, particularly in HTLV-1 carriers. Our objectives were to evaluate the efficacy of a new PCR method for the detection of S. stercoralis in HTLV-1-positive patients. Stools were collected over a 1-year period across the endemic region of French Guiana, including remote forest areas. Two systems of real-time PCR were then used comparatively, with small subunit and specific repeat as respective targets, and compared with the results of microscopic examinations. One-hundred and twelve stool samples were included. Twenty-seven patients (24.1%) presented a positive HTLV-1 serology. The overall prevalence of strongyloidiasis among the 112 patients was 30% with small-subunit PCR and 11.6% with microscopic examinations. In the seropositive population, all tested stools were negative, whereas 51.2% were positive using small-subunit PCR. Thus, PCR allowed a much-improved sensitivity, particularly in HTLV-1 carriers. Among the two systems investigated, small subunit yielded better results than specific repeat PCR, with prevalence rates in HTLV-1 carriers of 51.2% and 22.2%, respectively. Therefore, PCR should be considered as a useful tool for the diagnosis of strongyloidiasis, particularly in HTLV-1 carriers who often present a light parasitic load due to erratic administration of anthelmintic drugs.

TI  - The interaction between the natural metalloendopeptidase inhibitor BJ46a and its target toxin jararhagin analyzed by structural mass spectrometry and molecular modeling
T2  - JOURNAL OF PROTEOMICS
AB  - Snakebite envenoming affects millions of people worldwide, being officially considered a neglected tropical disease by the World Health Organization. The antivenom is effective in neutralizing the systemic effects of envenomation, but local effects are poorly neutralized, often leading to permanent disability. The natural resistance of the South American pit viper Bothrops jararaca to its venom is partly attributed to BJ46a, a natural snake venom metalloendopeptidase inhibitor. Upon complex formation, BJ46a binds non-covalently to the metalloendopeptidase, rendering it unable to exert its proteolytic activity. However, the structural features that govern this interaction are largely unknown. In this work, we applied structural mass spectrometry techniques (cross-linking-MS and hydrogen-deuterium exchange MS) and in silico analyses (molecular modeling, docking, and dynamics simulations) to understand the interaction between BJ46a and jararhagin, a metalloendopeptidase from B. jararaca venom. We explored the distance restraints generated from XL-MS experiments to guide the modeling of BJ46a and jararhagin, as well as the protein-protein docking simulations. HDX-MS data pinpointed regions of protection/deprotection at the interface of the BJ46a-jararhagin complex which, in addition to the molecular dynamics simulation data, reinforced our proposed interaction model. Ultimately, the structural understanding of snake venom metalloendopeptidases inhibition by BJ46a could lead to the rational design of drugs to improve anti-snake venom therapeutics, alleviating the high morbidity rates currently observed.

TI  - IMPORTANCE OF MIGRANTS INFECTED WITH ONCHOCERCA-VOLVULUS IN WEST AFRICAN RIVER VALLEYS PROTECTED BY 14 TO 15 YEARS OF SIMULIUM CONTROL
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND PARASITOLOGY
AB  - A study was done to determine the importance of human migration from non-controlled endemic onchocerciasis foci to the river valleys that have been protected for the past 14 to 15 years by the vector control operations of the Onchocerciasis Control Programme in West Africa. The aim of the study was to assess the contribution of migrants to the prevalence and intensity of infection in villages from 5 major river valleys and their potential role in causing relapse of transmission once the vector is allowed to return. In Burkina Faso the migrant population varied from 0.0% to 18.1% of the village population, and averaged 4.9%. Migrants accounted only for 0.6% of the population in Ghanaian and Ivorian villages along the Black Volta river. The prevalence of infection was significantly higher in migrants (8.2%) than in non migrants (1.1%) in the surveyed villages in Burkina Faso, and 1.5% of migrants had infections with more than 16 microfilariae per snip as against 0.2% of non migrants. Nearly all infected migrants came from the south of the Cote d'Ivoire. The study shows that human migration has caused the importation of Onchocerca volvulus from non-controlled areas. However, the epidemiological importance of this phenomenon is limited because of the very small number of infected migrants per village while two-third of the infected migrants are believed to be infected with the less pathogenic forest strain of the parasite. Because migration patterns changes geographically and over time similar studies will be continued on a regular basis.

TI  - Dengue outbreaks in Divinopolis, south-eastern Brazil and the geographic and climatic distribution of <i>Aedes albopictus</i> and <i>Aedes aegypti</i> in 2011-2012
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE & INTERNATIONAL HEALTH
AB  - ObjectiveTo entomologically monitor Aedes spp. and correlate the presence of these vectors with the recent epidemic of dengue in Divinopolis, Minas Gerais State, Brazil.
   MethodsOvitraps were installed at 44 points in the city, covering six urban areas, from May 2011 to May 2012. After collection, the eggs were incubated until hatching. In the 4th stage of development, the larvae were classified as Ae.aegypti or Ae.albopictus.
   ResultsIn total, 25633 Aedes spp. eggs were collected. February was the month with the highest incidence, with 5635 eggs collected and a hatching rate of 46.7%. Ae.aegypti eggs had the highest hatching rate, at 72.3%, whereas Ae.albopictus eggs had 27.7%. Climate and population density influenced the number of eggs found. Indicators of vector presence were positively correlated with the occurrence of dengue cases.
   ConclusionThese data reinforce the need for entomological studies, highlight the relevance of Ae.albopictus as a possible disease vector and demonstrate its adaptation. Ae.albopictus, most commonly found in forested areas, comprised a substantial proportion of the urban mosquito population.

TI  - How many flowering plants are pollinated by animals?
T2  - OIKOS
AB  - It is clear that the majority of flowering plants are pollinated by insects and other animals, with a minority utilising abiotic pollen vectors, mainly wind. However there is no accurate published calculation of the proportion of the ca 352 000 species of angiosperms that interact with pollinators. Widely cited figures range from 67% to 96% but these have not been based on firm data. We estimated the number and proportion of flowering plants that are pollinated by animals using published and unpublished community-level surveys of plant pollination systems that recorded whether each species present was pollinated by animals or wind. The proportion of animal-pollinated species rises from a mean of 78% in temperate-zone communities to 94% in tropical communities. By correcting for the latitudinal diversity trend in flowering plants, we estimate the global number and proportion of animal pollinated angiosperms as 308 006, which is 87.5% of the estimated species-level diversity of flowering plants. Given current concerns about the decline in pollinators and the possible resulting impacts on both natural communities and agricultural crops, such estimates are vital to both ecologists and policy makers. Further research is required to assess in detail the absolute dependency of these plants on their pollinators, and how this varies with latitude and community type, but there is no doubt that plant-pollinator interactions play a significant role in maintaining the functional integrity of most terrestrial ecosystems.

TI  - An Improved Cluster-Wise Typhoon Rainfall Forecasting Model Based on Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models Over the Northwestern Pacific Ocean
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
AB  - Though large amounts of work with artificial intelligence are used in typhoon rainfall forecasting, the predictive skills of existing models are unsatisfactory. To address this problem, this study aims to propose an improved cluster-wise typhoon rainfall forecasting model that integrates the grid-search cross-validation method with machine learning and deep learning (DL) models including support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), convolutional neural network (CNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM). Grid-search cross-validation is a modified parameterization technique that helps to find the best parameters for machine/DL models. In the first stage, a second-order polynomial regression model was used to cluster the typhoon track; and in the second stage, cluster-wise typhoon rainfall was recognized within a 500 km radius from each typhoon center. After that, a modified cluster-wise typhoon rainfall forecasting model was proposed using cluster-wise antecedent hourly typhoon rainfall within this distance for 1-6 hr lead time. Results show that the proposed model based on the SVM, RF, AdaBoost, CNN, and LSTM is capable of providing more accurate forecasts (the efficiency of the forecast is increased by 45%-90%) than the existing typhoon rainfall forecasting models that are based on SVM with a genetic algorithm, RF, artificial neural network, multilayer perceptron network, and deep neural network. Therefore, the current study recommends using cluster-wise typhoon rainfall forecasting model with a grid-search cross-validation method for disaster prevention and mitigation.

TI  - A Triazolopyrimidine-Based Dihydroorotate Dehydrogenase Inhibitor with Improved Drug-like Properties for Treatment and Prevention of Malaria
T2  - ACS INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB  - The emergence of drug-resistant malaria parasites continues to hamper efforts to control this lethal disease. Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase has recently been validated as a new target for the treatment of malaria, and a selective inhibitor (DSM265) of the Plasmodium enzyme is currently in clinical development. With the goal of identifying a backup compound to DSM265, we explored replacement of the SF5-aniline moiety of DSM265 with a series of CF3-pyridinyls while maintaining the core triazolopyrimidine scaffold. This effort led to the identification of DSM421, which has improved solubility, lower intrinsic clearance, and increased plasma exposure after oral dosing compared to DSM265, while maintaining a long predicted human half-life. Its improved physical and chemical properties will allow it to be formulated more readily than DSM265. DSM421 showed excellent efficacy in the SCID continued mouse model of P. falciparum malaria that supports the prediction of a low human dose (<200 mg). Importantly DSM421 showed equal activity against both P. falciparum and P. vivax field isolates, while DSM265 was more active on P. falciparum. DSM421 has the potential to be developed as a single-dose cure or once-weekly chemopreventative for both P. falciparum and P. vivax malaria, leading to its advancement as a preclinical development candidate.

TI  - A perplexing outbreak of mice in Patagonia, Argentina
T2  - STUDIES ON NEOTROPICAL FAUNA AND ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Early in spring, 1997, remarkably large numbers of mice appeared in the dense forests near the western end of Lago Nahuel Huapi, Argentina. Dead mice that washed up on nearby beaches at this time were fat, had full stomachs and were young or young-adults born unusually late in the preceding autumn and winter. These mice represented an aperiodic outbreak that extended over 300 km along the Andes. By analysis of trapped samples, the demographics of the two main species in this outbreak (Oligoryzomys longicaudatus and Abrothrix longipilis) were compared with demographics of the same species during the preceding 21 years. In spring of 1997, trap success for O. longicaudatus in areas of the outbreak was as high as 46%; for A. longipilis it was 22%. Neither males nor females of either species entered breeding condition in 1997 during the usual season of reproduction in spring, nor in the following summer, leading to the collapse of the populations. Numbers of Oligoryzomys decreased steadily to 15% in autumn and a normal 2% in the following spring, at which time reproduction resumed. The 1997 springtime populations in adjacent ecotone and steppe habitats to the east had not increased, contained no young individuals, and overwinter individuals reproduced normally. During the breeding season, O. longicaudatus in these populations increased more rapidly than did A. longipilis, and during the winter, they decreased faster.
   The unusual winter reproduction preceding the outbreak may have resulted from an increase in some deep-forest food source that in turn was responding to two successive, unusually warm winters. Predation played a negligible role in the population collapse. The mouse outbreak was not accompanied by an increase in human cases of hanta pulmonary syndrome, a disease for which O. longicaudatus is a reservoir.

TI  - Farmers' perceptions of practices and constraints in cassava (<i>Manihot esculenta</i> Crantz) chips production in rural Cameroon
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB  - A survey aimed at collecting information on practices and constraints in the production of cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) chips, a transformed cassava product obtained through fermentation and drying of its fresh roots was carried out in 45 villages located in three geographical regions (Yaounde Mbalmayo, and Ebolowa) of the humid forest zone of Cameroon. A structured questionnaire to interview farmers was employed. Out of 225 farmers sampled, 212 (94%) relying on chips as food and source of income were women. Overall, 51% of all farmers marketed chips locally. Three distinct forms of chips such as broken pulp (62%), balls (25%), and pellets (13%) were cited as being locally produced by farmers. These were obtained either through air fermentation (cassava pellets), or submerged fermentation (broken pulps and balls), using starters or fermenting agents (31% of responses) or without using them (69%). Chips were mainly home-stored in jute and or/plastic bags (43% of responses), open or closed containers (36%), or on devices hanging over the fireplace (21% of responses) for as long as 180 days. Dark spots or discolouration occurring as a result of chips damage were reported by the majority of respondents (82%) as frequent on cassava chips. These were related to insufficient drying (42%), the use of infected cassava roots by plant pathogenic microbes from the fields (12%), or too long drying of chips under sun light (11% of responses). To avoid dark spots and/or discolouration, 112 farmers out of a total of 185 who were aware about chips damage, practiced sun-drying, and 21% of this total dried their chips over the fireplace to control chips damage. Pests and diseases problems (47% of responses), mainly related to the incidence of Stictococcus vayssierei Richard (Homoptera: Stictococcidae) and lack of market (26%) were cited by farmers as the most important constraints in cassava chips production. From the results obtained, this study outlined that the potential utilization of cassava and its derived products for industrial purposes is not yet exploited in the locations investigated. Additionally, the study also raised concerns about the safety and hygiene associated with traditionally processed and stored cassava chips in the investigated areas.

A1  - Cochrane COVID-19 Diagnostic Test
TI  - Antibody tests for identification of current and past infection with SARS-CoV-2
T2  - COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS
AB  - Background
   The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus and resulting COVID-19 pandemic present important diagnostic challenges. Several diagnostic strategies are available to identify current infection, rule out infection, identify people in need of care escalation, or to test for past infection and immune response. Serology tests to detect the presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 aim to identify previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, and may help to confirm the presence of current infection.
   Objectives
   To assess the diagnostic accuracy of antibody tests to determine if a person presenting in the community or in primary or secondary care has SARS-CoV-2 infection, or has previously had SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the accuracy of antibodytests for use in seroprevalence surveys.
   Search methods
   We undertook electronic searches in the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register and the COVID-19 Living Evidence Database from the University of Bern, which is updated daily with published articles from PubMed and Embase and with preprints from medRxiv and bioRxiv. In addition, we checked repositories of COVID-19 publications. We did not apply any language restrictions. We conducted searches for this review iteration up to 27 April 2020.
   Selection criteria
   We included test accuracy studies of any design that evaluated antibody tests (including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, chemiluminescence immunoassays, and lateral flow assays) in people suspected of current or previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, or where tests were used to screen for infection. We also included studies of people either known to have, or not to have SARS-CoV-2 infection. We included all reference standards to define the presence or absence of SARS-CoV-2 (including reverse transcription po[ymerase chain reaction tests (RT-PCR) and clinical diagnostic criteria).
   Data collection and analysis
   We assessed possible bias and applicability of the studies using the QUADAS-2 tool. We extracted 2x2 contingency table data and present sensitivity and specificity for each antibody (or combination of antibodies) using paired forest plots. We pooled data using random-effects logistic regression where appropriate, stratifying by time since post-symptom onset. We tabulated available data by test manufacturer. We have presented uncertainty in estimates of sensitivity and specificity using 95% confidence intervals (Cis).
   Main results
   We included 57 publications reporting on a total of 54 study cohorts with 15,976 samples, of which 8526 were from cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Studies were conducted in Asia (n = 38), Europe (n = 15), and the USA and China (n = 1). We identified data from 25 commercial tests and numerous in-house assays, a small fraction of the 279 antibody assays listed by the Foundation for Innovative Diagnostics. More than half (n = 28) of the studies included were only available as preprints.
   We had concerns about risk of bias and applicability. Common issues were use of multi-group designs (n = 29), inclusion of only COVID-19 cases (n = 19), lack of blinding of the index test (n = 49) and reference standard (n = 29), differential verification (n = 22), and the lack of clarity about participant numbers, characteristics and study exclusions (n = 47). Most studies (n = 44) only included people hospitalised due to suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection. There were no studies exclusively in asymptomatic participants. Two-thirds of the studies (n = 33) defined COVID-19 cases based on RT-PCR results alone, ignoring the potential for false-negative RT-PCR results. We observed evidence of selective publication of study findings through omission of the identity of tests (n = 5).
   We observed substantial heterogeneity in sensitivities of IgA, IgM and IgG antibodies, or combinations thereof, for results aggregated across different time periods post-symptom onset (range 0% to 100% for all target antibodies). We thus based the main results of the review on the 38 studies that stratified results by time since symptom onset. The numbers of individuals contributing data within each study each week are small and are usually not based on tracking the same groups of patients over time.
   Pooled results for IgG, IgM, IgA, total antibodies and IgG/IgM all showed low sensitivity during the first week since onset of symptoms (all less than 30.1%), rising in the second week and reachingtheir highest values in the third week. The combination of IgG/IgM had a sensitivity of 30.1% (95% Cl 21.4 to 40.7) for 1 to 7 days, 72.2% (95% Cl 63.5 to 79.5) for 8 to 14 days, 91.4% (95% Cl 87.0 to 94.4) for 15 to 21 days. Estimates of accuracy beyond three weeks are based on smaller sample sizes and fewer studies. For 21 to 35 days, pooled sensitivities for IgG/IgM were 96.0% (95% Cl 90.6 to 98.3). There are insufficient studies to estimate sensitivity of tests beyond 35 days post-symptom onset. Summary specificities (provided in 35 studies) exceeded 98% for all target antibodies with confidence intervals no more than 2 percentage points wide. False-positive results were more common where COVID-19 had been suspected and ruled out, but numbers were small and the difference was within the range expected by chance.
   Assuming a prevalence of 50%, a value considered possible in healthcare workers who have suffered respiratory symptoms, we would anticipate that 43 (28 to 65) would be missed and 7 (3 to 14) would be falsely positive in 1000 people undergoing IgG/IgM testing at days 15 to 21 post-symptom onset. At a prevalence of 20%, a likely value in surveys in high-risk settings, 17 (11 to 26) would be missed per 1000 people tested and 10 (5 to 22) would be falsely positive. At a lower prevalence of 5%, a likely value in national surveys, 4 (3 to 7) would be missed per 1000 tested, and 12 (6 to 27) would be falsely positive.
   Analyses showed small differences in sensitivity between assay type, but methodological concerns and sparse data prevent comparisons between test brands.
   Authors' conclusions
   The sensitivity of antibody tests is too low in the first week since symptom onset to have a primary role for the diagnosis of COVID-19, but they may still have a role complementing other testing in individuals presenting later, when RT-PCR tests are negative, or are not done. Antibody tests are likely to have a useful role for detecting previous SARS-CoV-2 infection if used 15 or more days after the onset of symptoms. However, the duration of antibody rises is currently unknown, and we found very little data beyond 35 days post-symptom onset. We are therefore uncertain about the utility of these tests for seroprevalence surveys for public health management purposes. Concerns about high risk of bias and applicability make it likely that the accuracy of tests when used in clinical care will be lower than reported in the included studies. Sensitivity has mainly been evaluated in hospitalised patients, so it is unclear whether the tests are able to detect lower antibody levels likely seen with milder and asymptomatic COVID-19 disease.
   The design, execution and reporting of studies of the accuracy of COVID-19 tests requires considerable improvement. Studies must report data on sensitivity disaggregated by time since onset of symptoms. COVID-19-positive cases who are RT-PCR-negative should be included as well as those confirmed RT-PCR, in accordance with the World Health Organization (WHO) and China National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (CDC) case definitions. We were only able to obtain data from a small proportion of available tests, and action is needed to ensure that all results of test evaluations are available in the public domain to prevent selective reporting. This is a fast-moving field and we plan ongoing updates of this living systematic review.

TI  - Association of Fig Pollinating Wasps and Fig Nematodes inside Male and Female Figs of a Dioecious Fig Tree in Sumatra, Indonesia
T2  - INSECTS
AB  - Simple Summary It has been known that fig pollinating wasps can transfer nematodes when they enter receptive figs to deposit their eggs (male figs in male trees) and pollinate the flowers (female figs in female trees) of a dioecious fig tree. However, the fate of nematodes transferred into female figs was unknown, since the pollinating wasps that enter female figs cannot reproduce. This study examined whether the nematodes transferred by pollinating wasps into female figs of Ficus hispida could develop and reproduce in the same way as in male figs. Three species of nematodes were found to develop within the male and female figs of F. hispida, with populations peaking at about the same time for both sexes of figs. Our findings showed that the female figs could support the growth and reproduction of the three nematodes; however, there was no pollinator offspring to transfer the nematodes out of the figs. The results provide a better understanding of the development of nematodes in male and female figs of a dioecious fig tree, which may also influence the biodiversity of the tropical ecosystem. Nematodes can grow within the inflorescences of many fig trees (Ficus spp., Moraceae); however, the feeding behaviour of most nematodes is not known. Fig pollinating wasps (Hymenoptera: Agaonidae) transfer nematodes into young figs upon the wasps' entry into the figs to deposit their eggs. Most Asian fig trees, however, are functionally dioecious, and the pollinating wasps that enter female figs are unable to reproduce. They fail to produce the offspring required to carry the new generations of nematodes. We examined whether female figs of F. hispida can nonetheless support the development of phoretic nematode populations. Nematodes were extracted from male and female figs sampled in Sumatra, Indonesia, to compare the growth of their populations within the figs. We found three species of nematodes that grew within figs of male and female trees of F. hispida: Ficophagus cf. centerae (Aphelenchoididae), Martininema baculum (Aphelenchoididae) and Caenorhabditis sp (Rhabditidae). The latter species (Caenorhabditis sp.) has never been reported to be associated with F. hispida before. Nematode populations peaked at around 120-140 individuals in both sexes of figs, at the time when a succeeding generation of adult fig wasps appeared within male figs. The female figs could support the growth and reproduction of the three nematodes species; however, the absence of vectors meant that female figs remained as traps from which there could be no escape.

TI  - Biological and Chemical Evaluation of Some African Plants Belonging to <i>Kalanchoe</i> Species: Antitrypanosomal, Cytotoxic, Antitopoisomerase I Activities and Chemical Profiling using Ultra-Performance Liquid Chromatography/Quadrupole-Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometer
T2  - PHARMACOGNOSY MAGAZINE
AB  - Background: Human African trypanosomiasis is one of the most serious neglected tropical diseases causing fatal symptoms and death. Natural products are a main source for anti-infective metabolites. Objectives: The objective of the study is to evaluate eight different plants belonging to the Kalanchoe species growing in Egypt for antitrypanosomal, antimalarial, antileishmanial, cytotoxic, and antimicrobial activities. Materials and Methods: The antitrypanosomal activity against Trypanosoma brucei; cytotoxic activities against human colon carcinoma, human hepatocyte carcinoma, and human breast adenocarcinoma cell lines; antileishmanial activity against Leishmania donovani; antimalarial activity against Plasmodium falciparum; and antimicrobial activities of all plant extracts have been examined. As well as the identification of the secondary metabolites for the most active extract was performed via ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer operated in negative and positive ionization modes. Results: Among the examined plant extracts, Kalanchoe longiflora leaves extract showed promising activity against T. brucei with an inhibition concentration of sample at 50% fall in absorbance (IC50) value of 17.6 mu g/mL. K. longiflora with other extracts exhibited promising cytotoxic activities. Profiling of the polar secondary metabolites of K. longiflora revealed the presence of 47 metabolites including 31 flavonoids, 9 phenolic acids, 4 anthocyanidins, 2 chalcone glucoside, and 1 coumarin. To determine the mechanism of action of K. longiflora extract as a potent antitrypanosomal and cytotoxic agent, we investigate its ability to inhibit topoisomerase I enzyme. K. longiflora extract showed an excellent activity with an IC50 value of 0.148 mu g/mL. Conclusion: These interesting results open the door for further research aiming at the development of a successful treatment for Trypanosoma from K. longiflora.

TI  - Risk Mapping and Spatial Modeling of Human Cystic Echinococcosis in Iran from 2009 to 2018: A GIS-Based Survey
T2  - IRANIAN JOURNAL OF PARASITOLOGY
AB  - <bold>Background:</bold> Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is one of the most important parasitic infections in subgroup seven common neglected diseases of humans and animals. It is in the list of 18 neglected tropical diseases of the WHO. We aimed to analyze the situation of the disease in Iran using Geographical Information System (GIS) and satellite data analysis.<bold>Methods:</bold> The data obtained from the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, Tehran, Iran and other related centers from 2009 to 2018 were analyzed using GIS. Then, the spatial distribution maps of the disease were generated, and the hot spots of the disease in Iran were determined using spatial analysis of ArcGIS10.5 software. Geographically weighted regression (GWR) analysis in ArcGIS10.5 was used to correlate the variables affecting the disease including temperature, relative humidity, normalized different vegetation index (NDVI) and incidence of hydatidosis. Data analysis was performed by Linear regression analysis and SPSS 21 software using descriptive statistics and chi-square test.<bold>Results:</bold> Zanjan, Khorasan Razavi, North Khorasan, Chaharmahal Bakhtiari, Hamedan, Semnan, and Ardabil provinces were the hot spots of CE. The results of geographical weighted regression analysis showed that in Khorasan Razavi, North Khorasan, Chaharmahal Bakhtiari, Hamedan, Semnan, Ardabil, Zanjan, Qazvin, and Ilam provinces, the highest correlation between temperature, humidity, vegetation density and the incidence of hydatidosis was observed (P < 0.001).<bold>Conclusion:</bold> The use of maps could provide reliable estimates of at-risk populations. Climatic factors of temperature, humidity, NDVI had a greater impact on the probability of hydatidosis. These factors can be an indicator used to predict the presence of disease. Environmental and climatic factors were associated with echinococcosis.

TI  - Neurophysiological and behavioral responses of blacklegged ticks to host odors
T2  - JOURNAL OF INSECT PHYSIOLOGY
AB  - The blacklegged tick, Ixodes scapularis (Ixodida, Ixodidae), is one of the major disease vectors in the United States, and due to multiple human impact factors, such as decreasing forest size for land development and climate change, it has expanded its range and established across the United States. Throughout the life cycle, ticks locate hosts for their blood-meal, and although the ecologies of this tick and their hosts have been studied in depth, the sensory physiology behind host location largely remains unexplored. Here, we report establishing a robust paradigm to isolate and identify odors from the natural milieu for I. scapularis. We performed single sensillum recordings (SSR) from the olfactory sensilla on the tick tarsi, and used the SSR system as a biological detector to isolate natural compounds that elicited biological activity. The SSR setup was further tested in tandem with gas chromatography (GC) wherein the ticks' olfactory sensillum activity served as a biological detector. The GC-SSR recordings from the wall pore sensilla in the Haller's organ, and further identification of the biologically active deer gland constituents by GC-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) revealed methyl substituted phenols as strong chemostimuli, as compared to ethyl or propyl substitutions. The strongest electrophysiological activity was elicited by m- cresol followed by p- cresol. Ethyl- and propylphenols with any of the three substitutions (ortho, meta or para), did not induce any neurophysiological activity. Finally, a behavioral analysis in a dual-choice olfactometer of all these phenols at three different doses revealed no significant behavioral response, except for p- cresol at -3 dilution. Overall, this study contributes to our understanding of I. scapularis tick's neurophysiology and provides a robust platform to isolate and identify natural attractants and repellents.

TI  - Dengue infection in India: A systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Introduction
   Dengue is the most extensively spread mosquito-borne disease; endemic in more than 100 countries. Information about dengue disease burden, its prevalence, incidence and geographic distribution is critical in planning appropriate control measures against dengue fever. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of dengue fever in India
   Methods
   We searched for studies published until 2017 reporting the incidence, the prevalence or case fatality of dengue in India. Our primary outcomes were (a) prevalence of laboratory confirmed dengue infection among clinically suspected patients, (b) seroprevalence in the general population and (c) case fatality ratio among laboratory confirmed dengue patients. We used binomial +/- normal mixed effects regression model to estimate the pooled proportion of dengue infections. Forest plots were used to display pooled estimates. The metafor package of R software was used to conduct meta-analysis.
   Results
   Of the 2285 identified articles on dengue, we included 233 in the analysis wherein 180 reported prevalence of laboratory confirmed dengue infection, seven reported seroprevalence as evidenced by IgG or neutralizing antibodies against dengue and 77 reported case fatality. The overall estimate of the prevalence of laboratory confirmed dengue infection among clinically suspected patients was 38.3% (95% CI: 34.8% -41.8%). The pooled estimate of dengue seroprevalence in the general population and CFR among laboratory confirmed patients was 56.9% (95% CI: 37.5 - 74.4) and 2.6% (95% CI: 2 - 3.4) respectively. There was significant heterogeneity in reported outcomes (p-values< 0.001).
   Conclusions
   Identified gaps in the understanding of dengue epidemiology in India emphasize the need to initiate community-based cohort studies representing different geographic regions to generate reliable estimates of age-specific incidence of dengue and studies to generate dengue seroprevalence data in the country.

TI  - <i>Trichoderma asperellum</i>: A Dominant Endophyte Species in Cacao Grown in Sulawesi with Potential for Controlling Vascular Streak Dieback Disease
T2  - TROPICAL PLANT PATHOLOGY
AB  - Endophytic strains of Trichoderma species can be used as an alternative to chemicals to control vascular streak dieback (VSD) disease of cacao. Of 21 Trichoderma isolated from Theobroma cacao (cacao) in Indonesia, 19 were identified as Trichoderma asperellum. Four isolates of this species (ART-4, ART-5, ART-6 and ART-8) were reintroduced into young cocoa seedlings by root inoculation and after 4 weeks all were recovered from roots and stems, while ART-4 and ART-5 were recovered from leaves as well. Spraying seedlings pre-inoculated with T. asperellum ART-4, ART-5 and ART-6 with mycelium of the VSD pathogen Ceratobasidium theobromae resulted in no apparent VSD symptoms on the leaves. Those seedlings pre-inoculated with ART-8 showed 8.9 % incidence of VSD symptoms on the leaves when compared to a 20.4 % incidence of VSD on positive control leaves, 12 weeks after inoculation. The same isolates were also reintroduced into 3-month-old cocoa seedlings via the connecting site following shoot grafting, and after 12 weeks all isolates were recovered from stem and leaves. Seedlings grafted with buds infected by VSD and treated by ART-4 showed no VSD symptoms on their leaves 12 weeks after grafting and inoculation. However, those treated with ART-5, ART-6 and ART-8 showed 33.3 %, 50.0 % and 56.0 % incidence of VSD symptoms on their leaves, respectively, compared to an 88.9 % incidence of VSD on positive control leaves. Therefore, the study results demonstrates for the first time the potential of T. asperellum isolates to control VSD disease on cacao.

TI  - Identifying the potential global distribution and conservation areas for <i>Terminalia chebula</i>, an important medicinal tree species under changing climate scenario
T2  - TROPICAL ECOLOGY
AB  - Terminalia chebula Retz. (Combretaceae), commonly-known as chebulic myrobalan is one of the important Non-Timber Forest Product (NTFP) species which is harvested for its fruits and galls. The species known as the "King of medicines" is used widely in Ayurveda, Sidda, Unani, and traditional Chinese medicines for curing a wide variety of diseases in Asia and Africa. Terminalia chebula is an important ingredient of Triphala (Ayurvedic medicine) along with Terminalia bellirica and Phyllanthus emblica. The fruits of the tree also yields a dye which is used as an organic dye in the textile industries. In recent years, there is an increasing demand for herbal remedies and organic dyes, resulting in extensive extraction of fruits and galls from T. chebula. In this study, the major objective was to identify sites for the conservation of T. chebula and to identify important environmental variables determining its distribution. Based on the existing species distribution records (primary and secondary), along with a suite of climatic variables, the present and future distribution of the species were predicted. The study identified ecological niches that are suitable for the cultivation of the species; the species occurs in India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Myanmar, Vietnam, China, Laos, Thailand, Bhutan, Taiwan, Nepal and Bangladesh under the current climatic scenario. Within India, our results suggest that the central and south India are highly suitable in the current scenario. The mean annual temperature, temperature seasonality and isothermality seem to be the most important variables determining the distribution of the species which is directly influenced by climate change. Overall, the study indicated that under the future climate change scenarios the distribution of T. chebula is likely to decrease. The results indicate that T. chebula is highly vulnerable to climate change. Considering the economic importance of the species, it is important to understand how the species distribution will alter in the wake of climate change to develop effective conservation strategies. The study also provides important environment variables that determine the species distribution which could aid in identifying areas where the species could be cultivated.

TI  - Seasonal pattern of avian <i>Plasmodium</i>-infected mosquitoes and implications for parasite transmission in central Panama
T2  - PARASITOLOGY RESEARCH
AB  - Aedeomyia squamipennis and Culex (Melanoconion) ocossa, two ubiquitous Neotropical mosquito species, are likely involved in the transmission of several bird pathogens in Gamboa, central Panama. However, knowledge on their eco-epidemiological profiles is still incomplete. Our goal in this study was to investigate temporal trends of vector density and their relationship with avian plasmodia prevalence. This information is central to identifying the risk posed by each vector species to the avian community locally. We found that A. squamipennis maintains stable population size across climatic seasons and thus maybe a more efficient vector of avian malaria than C. ocossa. In contrast, C. ocossa, which undergoes considerable population expansion in the rainy season and contraction in the dry season, is likely only an important avian malaria vector during part of the year. This is consistent with the larger number of parasite isolations and Plasmodium cyt b lineages recovered from A. squamipennis than from C. ocossa and might be explained by marked differences in their seasonality and host-feeding preferences. More Plasmodium PCR testing in mosquito communities from other areas of Panama might reveal additional vectors of avian plasmodia.

TI  - Target product profile for a dengue pre-vaccination screening test
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - With increasing geographic spread, frequency, and magnitude of outbreaks, dengue continues to pose a major public health threat worldwide. Dengvaxia, a dengue live-attenuated tetravalent vaccine, was licensed in 2015, but post hoc analyses of long-term data showed serostatus-dependent vaccine performance with an excess risk of hospitalized and severe dengue in seronegative vaccine recipients. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommended that only persons with evidence of past dengue infection should receive the vaccine. A test for pre-vaccination screening for dengue serostatus is needed. To develop the target product profile (TPP) for a dengue pre-vaccination screening test, face-to-face consultative meetings were organized with follow-up regional consultations. A technical working group was formed to develop consensus on a reference test against which candidate pre-vaccination screening tests could be compared. The group also reviewed current diagnostic landscape and the need to accelerate the evaluation, regulatory approval, and policy development of tests that can identify seropositive individuals and maximize public health impact of vaccination while avoiding the risk of hospitalization in dengue-naive individuals. Pre-vaccination screening strategies will benefit from rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) that are affordable, sensitive, and specific and can be used at the point of care (POC). The TPP described the minimum and ideal characteristics of a dengue pre-vaccination screening RDT with an emphasis on high specificity. The group also made suggestions for accelerating access to these RDTs through streamlining regulatory approval and policy development. Risk and benefit based on what can be achieved with RDTs meeting minimal and optimal characteristics in the TPP across a range of seroprevalences were defined. The final choice of RDTs in each country will depend on the performance of the RDT, dengue seroprevalence in the target population, tolerance of risk, and cost-effectiveness.
   Author summary This paper describes the consensus on the minimum and ideal performance and operational characteristics of rapid tests that would be used for dengue pre-vaccination screening. This profile will incentivize industry to develop better pre-vaccination screening tests. The choice of which test to use depends on the seroprevalence of the population targeted for vaccination and the optimal balance between benefit and risks. The group also made suggestions for accelerating access to these pre-vaccination screening tests through streamlining regulatory approval and policy development.

TI  - New genetic information and geographic distribution of charismatic carnivores: the olingos (Procyonidae: <i>Bassaricyon</i>) in Colombia
T2  - MAMMALIAN BIOLOGY
AB  - Integrative taxonomic reviews of highly charismatic carnivores such as the neotropical olingos (Bassaricyon) is limited by the scarcity of specimens for morphological and associated material, such as fresh tissues for molecular analyses. Although Colombia harbors three olingo species (Bassaricyon alleni, B. medius, and B. neblina), only sequences of a single individual are available. Here, we present records that fill gaps in areas with sampling bias and extend the information on the current and potential distribution of olingos from Colombia. Furthermore, we generated new cytochrome-b and Cholinergic Receptor Nicotinic Alpha Polypeptide 1 precursor sequences from three additional specimens from Colombia. B. medius shows the widest distribution from northern Panama, crossing the Pacific Forest, the Magdalena basin, the Caribbean, and the Andean slopes in Colombia to Tumbes in Peru. For B. neblina, the potential distribution extends over the northern Andes, including the Occidental and the Central cordilleras of Colombia, and the Occidental and Oriental Andes of Ecuador. Despite B. alleni has the largest potential distribution in Colombia, we only found seven records from the montane forests of the Cordillera Oriental. The area of occupancy (AOO) and the extent of occurrence (EOO) in Colombia is 84 km(2) and 141,970 km(2) for B. medius, 116 km(2) and 126,530 km(2) for B. neblina. Although B. alleni has a larger potential distribution, there is a scarcity of records for this species in Colombia, and its AOO is only 28 km(2). This information could be useful to assess research priorities and threats for olingos in Colombia.

TI  - <i>Trypanosoma cruzi</i> transmission in a captive primate unit, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
T2  - ACTA TROPICA
AB  - A breeding in captivity program of neotropical primates for subsequent reintroduction in nature is in progress at the Primatology Center of Rio de Janeiro (CPRJ). Almost 200 animals of 20 species that include both wild captured animals and specimens born in captivity are maintained in CPRJ. Here, we examined 198 primates of CPRJ for infection with the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. The animals included 18 species of eight genera. We also performed an "ad lib" search for triatomines that could be incriminated as putative transmitters of the protozoan in this scenario. Anti-T cruzi antibodies were observed (by indirect immunofluorescence assay-IFA) in 40 monkeys (26.5%). Four Panstrongylits megistus were collected in the monkey's food storage room near the cages and in human dwellings in the proximity to CPRJ. T cruzi were isolated from nine primates of two genera (Leontopithecus and Saguinus) and from two individuals of the vector P. megistus. The transmission inside the cages could be attested by the isolation of the T cruzi from primates born in captivity. Multi-locus enzyme electrophoresis (MLEE) demonstrated that the two isolates from Saguinus bicolor bicolor displayed a zymodeme 1 profile in four out of five tested enzymes, while all isolates derived from Leontopithecus showed zymodeme 2 for four out of the five tested enzymes. Mini-exon gene analysis genotyped all isolates as T cruzi II, which is associated with human disease in Brazil. A wild primate unit such as CPRJ, located inside the forest and near to human dwellings and with T cruzi II infected animals, deserves a careful surveillance in order to prevent expansion of the infection.

TI  - Unavoidable Risks: Local Perspectives on Water Contact Behavior and Implications for Schistosomiasis Control in an Agricultural Region of Northern Senegal
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Human schistosomiasis is a snail-borne parasitic disease affecting more than 200 million people worldwide. Direct contact with snail-infested freshwater is the primary route of exposure. Water management infrastructure, including dams and irrigation schemes, expands snail habitat, increasing the risk across the landscape. The Diama Dam, built on the lower basin of the Senegal River to prevent saltwater intrusion and promote year-round agriculture in the drought-prone Sahel, is a paradigmatic case. Since dam completion in 1986, the rural population-whose livelihoods rely mostly on agriculture-has suffered high rates of schistosome infection. The region remains one of the most hyperendemic regions in the world. Because of the convergence between livelihoods and environmental conditions favorable to transmission, schistosomiasis is considered an illustrative case of a disease-driven poverty trap (DDPT). The literature to date on the topic, however, remains largely theoretical. With qualitative data generated from 12 focus groups in four villages, we conducted team-based theme analysis to investigate how perception of schistosomiasis risk and reported preventive behaviors may suggest the presence of a DDPT. Our analysis reveals three key findings: 1) rural villagers understand schistosomiasis risk (i.e., where and when infections occur), 2) accordingly, they adopt some preventive behaviors, but ultimately, 3) exposure persists, because of circumstances characteristic of rural livelihoods. These findings highlight the capacity of local populations to participate actively in schistosomiasis control programs and the limitations of widespread drug treatment campaigns. Interventions that target the environmental reservoir of disease may provide opportunities to reduce exposure while maintaining resource-dependent livelihoods.

T2  - PARASITE
AB  - Development of meronts and gametocytes of Garnia karyolytica nov.sp., is described in erthrocytes of the neotropical forest gecko Thecodactylus rapicaudus from Para State, north Brazil. Meronts are round to subpherical and predominantly polar in position. forms reaching 12.0 x 10.0 mu m contain from 20-28 nuclei. Macrogametocytes and microgametocytes are predominantly elongate, lateral in the erythrocyte and average 16.6 x 6.3 mu m and 15.25 x 6.24 mu m respectively. Occasional spherical forms of both sexes occur in a polar or lateropolar position. Ail stages of development are devoid of malarial pigment. They hove a progressively lytic effect on the host-cell nucleus, particularly the mature gametocytes, which enlarge and deform the erythrocyte. Possible vector(s) of garniid parasites are considered, and phlebotomine sandflies are high on the list of suspects.

TI  - Historical and contemporary forces combine to shape patterns of genetic differentiation in two species of Mesoamerican <i>Anopheles</i> mosquitoes
T2  - BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY
AB  - Pleistocene environmental changes were important drivers of species-and population-level diversification in Anopheles mosquitoes. However, Anopheles species have different ecologies, so their response to Pleistocene climate oscillations should have differed. We investigate whether genetic diversification in Anopheles punctimacula s. s. (a forest specialist and secondary vector of Plasmodium vivax) and Anopheles albimanus (a habitat colonist and primary vector of P. vivax and P. falciparum) is due to: (1) historical population processes, (2) contemporary population processes or (3) a combination of both. Differences in the degree of refugial isolation during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and the degree to which isolated populations evolved habitat niche differences appear to explain differences in the phylogeographical patterns between A. punctimacula s. s. and A. albimanus in Lower Middle America (Mesoamerica). Refugial isolation during the LGM and subsequent niche diversification shaped the phylogeographical history of A. punctimacula s. s. During the LGM, the genetic pool of this species was fragmented into extremely narrow and scattered habitat refugia, resulting in two discrete mitochondrial lineages. Subsequently, these lineages appear to have further evolved distinct niche preferences and diversified due to different climatic conditions between populations, which may have contributed to the lack of introgression or range overlap among mitochondrial lineages. While A. albimanus also experienced range contraction, recovery was more rapid, and we find no evidence of niche evolution among lineages. This appears to explain the broad mitochondrial introgression in this species. Greater resilience to climatic instability by A. albimanus might contribute to its principal transmission role for human Plasmodium parasites across the Neotropics.

TI  - PREVALENCE OF ANTIBODIES TO SELECTED VIRUSES AND PARASITES IN INTRODUCED AND ENDEMIC CARNIVORES IN WESTERN MADAGASCAR
T2  - JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE DISEASES
AB  - Introduced animals impact endemic populations through predation, competition, and disease transmission. Populations of endemic carnivores in Madagascar are declining, and pathogens transmitted from introduced species may further endanger these unique species. We assessed the exposure of introduced and endemic carnivores to common viral and parasitic pathogens in two national parks of Madagascar (Kirindy Mitea National Park and Ankarafantsika National Park) and their neighboring villages. We also identified variables associated with the presence of antibodies to these pathogens in fosa (Cryptoprocta ferox). Introduced and endemic species were exposed to canine parvovirus, canine herpesvirus, feline calicivirus, and Toxoplasma gondii. Domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) and cats (Felis catus) may be sources of infection for these pathogens. Prevalence of antibodies to Toxoplasma in captured fosa was >93%, and adults were more likely to be exposed than immature individuals. Our data provide a basis upon which to evaluate and manage risks of pathogen transmission between species.

TI  - <i>Lutzomyia longipalpis</i>, Gone with the Wind and Other Variables
T2  - NEOTROPICAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - Lutzomyia longipalpis(Lutz & Neiva) is the main vector ofLeishmania infantum(Nicolle) in America, associated in turn with the current spread and urbanization of American visceral leishmaniasis (AVL). The vector distribution in AVL foci shows a spatial-temporal clustering despite the different epidemiological contexts. The factors associated with the macroscale distribution ofLu. longipalpisas a landscape stratification are discussed in the framework of the process of their adaptation to anthropized environments. On the other hand, the fact thatLu. longipalpisis clustered in only a few hot spots or critical sites suggests that microscale approaches that describe the trap surrounding environment and the availability of refuges and food sources are better at explaining the uneven distribution of this vector, and should contribute, together with macroscale variables, to design operational control strategies. With regard to temporal distribution and climatic or vegetation data obtained by remote sensing as variables to explain and forecast the abundance ofLu. longipalpis, it is necessary to take into account the time lags in relation to the life cycle of the vector, the difference between the level of daily activity and actual abundance, and the differences in critical variables and thresholds according to the region or season. In conclusion, this review shows that it is feasible to characterize the distribution ofLu. longipalpisat focus level and within it to identify the main critical sites, proposing a sequential cost-effectivity strategy for urban AVL surveillance and control.

TI  - Molecular identification and phylogeny of <i>Armillaria</i> isolates from South America and Indo-Malaysia
T2  - MYCOLOGIA
AB  - Armillaria root rot is a serious disease, chiefly of woody plants, caused by many species of Armillaria that occur in temperate, tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Very little is known about Armillaria in South America and Southeast Asia, although Armillaria root rot is well known in these areas. In this study, we consider previously unidentified isolates collected from trees with symptoms of armillaria root rot in Chile, Indonesia and Malaysia. In addition, isolates from basidiocarps resembling A. novae-zelandiae and A. limonea originating from Chile and Argentina, respectively, were included in this study because their true identity has been Uncer tain. All isolates in this study were compared, based on their similarity in ITS sequences with previously sequenced Armillaria species, and their phylogenetic relationship with species from the Southern Hemisphere was considered. ITS sequence data for Armilaria also were compared with those available at GenBank. Parsimony and distance analyses were conducted to determine the phylogenetic relationships between the unknown isolates and the species that showed high ITS sequence similarity. In addition, IGS-1 sequence data were obtained for some of the species to validate the trees obtained from the ITS data set. Results of this study showed that the ITS sequences of the isolates obtained from basidiocarps resembling A. novae-zelandiae are most similar to those for this species. ITS sequences for isolates from Indonesia and Malaysia had the highest similarity to A. novae-zelandirte but were phylogenetically separated from this species. Isolates from Chile, for which basidiocarps were not found, were similar in their ITS and IGS-1 sequences to the isolate from Argentina that resembled A. limonea. These isolates, however, had the highest ITS and IGS-1 sequence similarity to authentic isolates of A. luteobubalina and were phylogenetically more closely related to this species than to A. limonea.

TI  - "Liaisons dangereuses": The invasive red-vented bulbul (<i>Pycnonotus cafer</i>), a disperser of exotic plant species in New Caledonia
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB  - The biodiversity hotspot of New Caledonia hosts high levels of endemism (74% of flora) that is threatened increasingly by climate change, habitat reduction, and invasive species. The fruit-eating red-vented bulbul (Pycnonotus cafer) is currently invading the main island of the archipelago, and its recent dispersal out of urbanized habitats raises questions about its potential to disperse noxious plant seeds along urban corridors and beyond. Indeed, the red-vented bulbul is considered a vector of several introduced plant species in its alien range including Miconia calvescens, Lantana camara, and Schinus terebinthifolius. We conducted a quantitative assessment of the bulbul's fruits consumption by analyzing the gut contents of shot birds. We estimated gut passage times for four species of fruit found in gut contents (S.terebinthifolius, Myrtastrum rufopunctatum, Passiflora suberosa, and Ficus prolixa) and tested the effects of bird digestion on seed germination rates for two species. Finally, we monitored the movements of individual VHF radio-tagged red-vented bulbuls. All of the consumed fruit species we identified here have red fleshy diaspore, including fruit of the shrub M.rufopunctatum that occurred frequently (9.6%) in bulbul gut samples. Median gut passage times were short (15-41min), corresponding to short-distance seed transportation (77-92m). The effect of gut passage was positive for the germination of the invasive S.terebinthifolius and negative for the endemic M.rufopunctatum, suggesting a potential bias in the contribution to the dispersal toward alien species. This study provides the first integrated assessment of mechanisms involved in the seed dispersal effectiveness of this high-concern invasive bird species that is expected to face similar plant communities in most of its alien range in tropical islands. More generally, our results enhance knowledge of synergies between non-native frugivores and plant species dispersal.

TI  - Changing scenario of malaria in central India, the replacement of <i>Plasmodium vivax</i> by <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> (1986-2000)
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE & INTERNATIONAL HEALTH
AB  - OBJECTIVES Since 1986, we have been studying the changing epidemiology of malaria in a forest belt of Mandla, which has the highest number of malaria cases in central India (Madhya Pradesh) to define the epidemiological characteristics of the infection with each Plasmodium species in different seasons of the year. Our long-term objective was to determine the dynamics of Plasmodium vivaxvs.P. falciparum infections.
   METHODS Five villages underwent fortnightly surveillance of fever cases. Drugs were distributed within 24 h after results of blood smears became available as per Indian National Anti-Malaria Programme. Indoor resting mosquitoes were also collected fortnightly.
   RESULTS The only two Plasmodium species encountered were P. vivax and P. falciparum in both children and adults. Relatively more malaria infections were recorded in children (less than or equal to14 years) than adults (>14 years) (chi(2) = 89.94, P < 0.00001). However, there were significant falling trends in P. vivax from 1986 to 2000 in both age groups (less than or equal to14 years from 63 to 13, P < 0.0001 and >14 years from 84 to 7, P < 0.0001). The indoor resting density of Anopheles culicifacies, an efficient vector resistant to both dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) (4%) and hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) (0.4%), was very high throughout this period in all villages (52.35 +/- 31.8, range 5-200 per man hour). Anopheles fluviatilis was present in small numbers 0.78 +/- 1.24 (range 0-7 per man hour).
   CONCLUSION Major contributors of the changing epidemiology of malaria in this area are changing drug sensitivity along with insecticide sensitivity.

TI  - The brown root rot fungus <i>Phellinus noxius</i> affects microbial communities in different root-associated niches of <i>Ficus</i> trees
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Brown root rot (BRR) caused by Phellinus noxius is a destructive tree disease in tropical and subtropical areas. To understand how BRR affects the composition of the plant rhizoplane-enriched microbiota, the microbiomes within five root-associated compartments (i.e., bulk soil, old/young root rhizosphere soil, old/young root tissue) of Ficus trees naturally infected by P. noxius were investigated. The level of P. noxius infection was determined by quantitative PCR. Illumina sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer and 16S rRNA revealed that P. noxius infection caused a significant reduction in fungal diversity in the bulk soil, the old root rhizosphere soil, and the old root tissue. Interestingly, Cosmospora was the only fungal genus positively correlated with P. noxius. The abundance and composition of dominant bacterial taxa such as Actinomadura, Bacillus, Rhodoplanes, and Streptomyces differed between BRR-diseased and healthy samples. Furthermore, 838 isolates belonging to 26 fungal and 35 bacterial genera were isolated and tested for interactions with P. noxius. Antagonistic activities were observed for isolates of Bacillus, Pseudomonas, Aspergillus, Penicillium, and Trichoderma. Cellophane overlay and cellulose/lignin utilization assays suggested that Cosmospora could tolerate the secretions of P. noxius and that the degradation of lignin by P. noxius may create suitable conditions for Cosmorpora growth.

TI  - Induced resistance to <i>Fusarium oxysporum</i> in mechanically stressed <i>Acacia koa</i> A. Gray seedlings
T2  - PHYSIOLOGICAL AND MOLECULAR PLANT PATHOLOGY
AB  - Acacia koa A. Gray (koa) is a leguminous timber wood tree endemic to the Hawaiian Islands. Koa forests have been suffering from a devastating wilt disease caused by the fungal pathogen Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. koae. To protect koa forestry from the disease, it is crucial to understand how disease resistance is conferred in koa. Here we show that non-wounding mechanical stress enhances resistance against F. oxysporum in koa as the survival rate of stressed seedlings doubled compared to that of unstressed seedlings (40.6% and 17.0%, respectively) following 3 weeks of mechanical treatment. The mechanical stress induces genes for antifungal activities, including those for pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis enzymes, within 6 h. Consistent with the gene expression, the extract from the stems of stressed plants had an increased total phenolic content as well as antifungal activity. Stressed plants also showed faster and enhanced expression of genes for the antifungal proteins upon inoculation by F. oxysporum f. sp. koae. These results indicate that a simple non-wounding mechanical stress can prime koa seedlings for the subsequent fungal infection to enhance disease resistance, and non-wounding mechanical stress may be a useful tool to study mechanisms underlying disease resistance in koa.

TI  - Assessing the Various Antagonistic Mechanisms of <i>Trichoderma</i> Strains against the Brown Root Rot Pathogen <i>Pyrrhoderma noxium</i> Infecting Heritage Fig Trees
T2  - JOURNAL OF FUNGI
AB  - A wide range of phytopathogenic fungi exist causing various plant diseases, which can lead to devastating economic, environmental, and social impacts on a global scale. One such fungus is Pyrrhoderma noxium, causing brown root rot disease in over 200 plant species of a variety of life forms mostly in the tropical and subtropical regions of the globe. The aim of this study was to discover the antagonistic abilities of two Trichoderma strains (#5001 and #5029) found to be closely related to Trichoderma reesei against P. noxium. The mycoparasitic mechanism of these Trichoderma strains against P. noxium involved coiling around the hyphae of the pathogen and producing appressorium like structures. Furthermore, a gene expression study identified an induced expression of the biological control activity associated genes in Trichoderma strains during the interaction with the pathogen. In addition, volatile and diffusible antifungal compounds produced by the Trichoderma strains were also effective in inhibiting the growth of the pathogen. The ability to produce Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), siderophores and the volatile compounds related to plant growth promotion were also identified as added benefits to the performance of these Trichoderma strains as biological control agents. Overall, these results show promise for the possibility of using the Trichoderma strains as potential biological control agents to protect P. noxium infected trees as well as preventing new infections.

TI  - Floristic Diversity as an Indicator in Low and High Endemic Buruli Ulcer Areas in Cote d'Ivoire
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB  - Mycobacterium ulcerans is an environmental bacterium responsible for Buruli ulcer. This disease has a high frequency index in humid tropical regions, with a high incidence in Sub-Saharan Africa. The ecology and mode of transmission of this disease is not well established. Based on dilution effect hypothesis, acting as lowering disease transmission due to greater biodiversity, floristic inventory was carried out in the Health Districts of Daloa and Bouake in Cote d'Ivoire. In each district, high and low endemic sites were investigated. A total of 169 plant species were inventoried for both low and high endemicity of Buruli ulcer sites in the districts. The Indval index revealed that 13 plant species were good indicators for Buruli ulcer highly endemic areas. The plants which correlate with high endemicity area were Leersia hexandra, Panicum laxum, Mimosa pudica, Paspalum distichum, Persicaria senegalensis, Calopogonium mucunoides, Echinochloa colona, Ipomoea sagittata, and Eichhornia crassipes. For low endemic sites, a strong relationship was recorded for 37 plants. The indices revealed low similarity between high and low endemicity sites. Low endemicity sites expressed the highest plant species diversity. These results suggest the hypothesis that floristic richness is more important in sites of low endemicity than in those of high endemicity. Moreover, we observed a co-occurrence of some plant species and Buruli ulcer endemicity. This finding may lead to the fact that it is important to care about the biodiversity to prevent outbreak of Buruli ulcer cases.

TI  - Correlation between VOC fingerprinting and antimicrobial activity of several essential oils extracted by plant resins against <i>A. tumefaciens</i> and <i>P. savastanoi</i>
T2  - FLAVOUR AND FRAGRANCE JOURNAL
AB  - The present work aimed to assess the antimicrobial activity of twelve essential oils extracted from plant resins of trees that grow in several tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Eleven essential oils were extracted from resins of plant belonging to the Burseraceae family (the genera Boswellia, Commiphora, Canarium and Bursera); the remaining oil was extracted from a resinous plant belonging to the Fabaceae family (genus Hymenea). The extraction was carried out using a conventional distillation method. The volatile organic compounds (VOCs) of each essential oil were analyzed with PTR-ToF-MS (proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry) and the antimicrobial activity was evaluated against the phytopathogens Agrobacterium tumefaciens and Pseudomonas savastanoi pv. savastanoi. The essential oils obtained from Boswellia papyrifera, B. dalzielii, B. frereana and B. rivae were the most abundant in terms of signal intensity and VOC number in comparison with the other analyzed essential oils. Furthermore, B. neglecta shared a common volatile profile with the Canarium species, as was demonstrated previously in the literature. Greater bacterial growth inhibition of A. tumefaciens was detected with the essential oils extracted from plants belonging to Boswellia species while less action was observed against P. savastanoi. Finally, a positive correlation was found between terpenes and terpenoid compounds and bacterial growth inhibition, suggesting these essential oils as a new source of bioactive compounds for the prevention, protection and treatment of plant diseases.

TI  - Collapse of a historic oyster fishery: diagnosing causes and identifying paths toward increased resilience
T2  - ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
AB  - Diagnosing causal factors of change at the ecosystem level is challenging because multiple drivers often interact at various spatial and temporal scales. We employ an integrated natural and social science approach to assess potential mechanisms leading to the collapse of an estuarine social-ecological system, and recommend future paths to increased system resilience. Our case study is the collapse of the eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) fishery in Apalachicola Bay, Florida, USA, and the associated impacts on local resource dependent communities. The oyster fishery collapse is the most recent in a series of environmental stressors to this region, which have included hurricanes and tropical storms, drought, and the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. We found it likely that the oyster collapse was not related to contamination from the recent oil spill, but rather to factors affecting oyster recruitment and survival, which may have been mediated by both human, e.g., fishing-related habitat alteration, and environmental, e.g., increased natural mortality from predators and disease, factors. The relative impact of each of these factors is likely to increase in the future because of changing climate and increased demand for fishery, water, and petroleum resources. Successful restoration and persistence of a viable oyster fishery will depend on: (1) implementation of some minimal best management practices, e.g., extensive habitat restoration via shell addition, and some spatial closures to harvest, (2) improving environmental knowledge and promoting episodic learning through enhanced monitoring and experimental management, and (3) continued community engagement necessary to produce adaptable governance suitable to responding to future unexpected challenges.

TI  - Chemical composition and <i>in vitro</i> antitrypanosomal activity of fractions of essential oil from <i>Cymbopogon nardus</i> L.
T2  - TROPICAL BIOMEDICINE
AB  - Essential oil from Cymbopogon nardus was evaluated for activity against Trypanosoma brucei brucei BS221 (IC50 = 0.31 +/- 0.03 mu g/mL) and cytotoxic effect on normal kidney (Vero) cells (IC50 = >100 mu g/mL). The crude essential oil was subjected to various chromatography techniques afforded active sub fractions with antitrypanosomal activity; F4 (IC50 = 0.61 +/- 0.06 mu g/mL), F6 (IC50 = 0.73 +/- 0.33 mu g/mL), F7 (IC50 = 1.15 +/- 0 mu g/mL) and F8 (IC50 = 1.11 +/- 0.01 mu g/mL). These active fractions did not exhibit any toxic effects against Vero cell lines and the chemical profiles investigation indicated presence of alpha-and gamma-eudesmol, elemol, alpha-cadinol and eugenol by GC/MS analysis.

TI  - PHLEBOTOMINE FAUNA (DIPTERA: PSYCHODIDAE) IN AN AREA OF FISHING TOURISM IN CENTRAL-WESTERN BRAZIL
T2  - REVISTA DO INSTITUTO DE MEDICINA TROPICAL DE SAO PAULO
AB  - The aim of this study was to identify behavioral aspects of the sandfly fauna of a fishing tourism area in the municipality of Bonito (MS). Monthly captures were undertaken from December 2009 to November 2010, using automatic CDC type light traps, from 18h00 to 06h00, in a forested area, a savannah area, peridomiciles and animal shelters near peridomiciliary areas. Nyssomyia whitmani was the most frequent out of a total of 6,699 specimens collected, belonging to 16 species, followed by Psathyromyia bigeniculata and Lutzomyia longipalpis, found in all the environments investigated, though in their greatest numbers in the animal shelters. Ny. whitmani exhibited its highest frequencies during the dry months, coincident with the fishing season, when the risk of transmission of cutaneous leishmaniasis for tourists and inhabitants increases. Noteworthy was the finding of two species naturally infected by flagellates: Ny. whitmani and Pa. bigeniculata. The local population and visiting tourists should be warned of the threat posed by leishmaniasis and the health authorities alerted to the need for adopting environmental sanitary measures, especially regarding such animal shelters as they seem to provide favorable conditions to the proliferation, maintenance and breeding opportunities of phlebotomines.

TI  - Taxonomic Advances from Fungal Flora Associated with Ferns and Fern-like Hosts in Northern Thailand
T2  - PLANTS-BASEL
AB  - Ferns are one of the most significant plant groupings that comprise a substantial proportion of the plant flora due to the fact of their great diversity, especially in tropical areas. The biodiversity of fungi associated with ferns and fern-like hosts has also received little attention in studies. Plant samples were collected from diseased and dead plants of ten fern or fern-like species from Chiang Rai in northern Thailand. Forty-one isolates were selected from the obtained isolates for molecular and morphological analysis, with a focus on pathogenic fungal genera and consideration of the diversity in host and geographical location. Twenty-six species belonging to seven genera (Colletotrichum, Curvularia, Diaporthe, Fusarium, Lasiodiplodia, Neopestalotiopsis, and Pestalotiopsis) in six families were identified. Thirty new hosts, eight new geographical hosts, and one new species, Colletotrichum polypodialium, are described. Nepestalotiopsis phangngaensis, N. pandancola, Diaporthe tectonendophytica, D. chiangraiensis, and D. delonicis were isolated for the first time from leaf spots. Additionally, new reservoirs and geographical locations for species previously isolated from leaf spots or whose pathogenicity was established were found. However, more studies are necessary to prove the pathogenicity of the fungi isolated from the leaf spots and to identify the fungi associated with other species of ferns.

TI  - The prevalence, risk factors and outcomes of anaemia in South African pregnant women: a protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS
AB  - Background: A significant cause of morbidity and mortality during pregnancy is maternal anaemia. The causes of anaemia and the sequelae are varied, and the prevention and management are public health challenges, especially in resource-limited settings and certain geographic locations. South Africa is plagued by a quadruple burden of disease, with high maternal mortality rates affected by hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, HIV, tuberculosis and neglected tropical diseases. This is most prevalent in people of lower socio-economic status. Poor nutrition, chronic infections, lack of access to health care facilities and poor compliance with micronutrient supplementation all contribute to maternal anaemia. The aim of this study is to systematically map the literature to ascertain the pooled prevalence and associated causes of anaemia in the South African pregnant population, which will enable health care workers and other key stakeholders to more pertinently address Sustainable Development Goal 3 focussing on good health and reducing maternal mortality.
   Methods: PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, EBSCO, Ovid maternity and infant care databases, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Web of Science and SCOPUS will be searched using the keywords 'anaemia', 'haemoglobin', 'pregnancy', and 'South Africa' to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to explore, describe and map literature on the distribution and burden of anaemia in pregnant women in South Africa. The reference list of articles selected for review will be scanned for other articles of interest to our study question. Studies published in any language will be included in this review. As there may be differences in sampled populations in South Africa based on geography and sociodemographic factors, a weighted inverse-variance meta-analysis using a random-effects model will be carried out to generate a pooled prevalence estimate. A Funnel plot and Egger's regression test will be conducted to assess publication bias. Heterogeneity among studies will be checked usingI(2)to determine dispersion and meta-regression analysis will be performed to investigate the source of heterogeneity. The articles obtained by these searches will be analysed for causative factors, severity and outcomes by a parallel and independent review team, using suitable eligibility criteria. Screening, data extraction and quality appraisal will be conducted independently by two authors. Disagreement will be resolved by independent assessment by a third reviewer. Sub group analysis by region, stage of pregnancy, socio-economic status, severity and cause of anaemia will be conducted if sufficient data is available. Data will be analysed using statistical software and presented in evidence tables and in meta-analytic forest plots.
   Discussion: This protocol is developed to systematically review the literature on the prevalence and severity of anaemia, risk factors and outcomes in pregnant women in South Africa. Correlation of factors contributing to the development of anaemia and other disorders during pregnancy will facilitate exploration of appropriate medical and behavioural change interventions implemented within other countries or regions that mitigate risk. This study will assist local health systems to inform public health policies and practises for more favourable maternal and fetal outcomes.

TI  - Dry season refugia of malaria-transmitting mosquitoes in a dry savannah zone of east Africa
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Dry season survival of Anopheles funestus, Anopheles gambiae and Anopheles arabiensis in the Kilombero valley a dry savannah zone of east Africa, was investigated with over 400 collections from 23 areas, covering 300 sq km of the valley. Anopheles gambiae was found only in association with humans, in forested areas of high annual rainfall, while An. funestus occurred at high densities at the valley edge where large non-moving bodies of water remained. A large population of An. arabiensis was present along the river system throughout the middle of the valley, and mosquitoes probably derived from this population were occasionally caught in villages bordering the valley. No evidence was obtained of aestivation in any mosquito species. Anopheles gambiae was the most long lived, 6.3% compared to 2.0% of the An. arabiensis and 4% of the An. funestus surviving for four or more gonotrophic cycles, the approximate duration of the extrinsic cycle of most malaria parasites. Oocysts of malaria parasites were found in 5.4% of An. funestus and 2.3% of An. arabiensis from villages. Oocyst rates in An. funestus differed significantly between areas but not between houses within areas. Anopheles funestus is the most important dry season malaria vector in the valley, and remains in foci closely associated with groups of houses. All three species survive at high densities but as otherwise hidden refugia populations.

TI  - A systematic review of the impacts and management of introduced deer (family Cervidae) in Australia
T2  - WILDLIFE RESEARCH
AB  - Deer are among the world's most successful invasive mammals and can have substantial deleterious impacts on natural and agricultural ecosystems. Six species have established wild populations in Australia, and the distributions and abundances of some species are increasing. Approaches to managing wild deer in Australia are diverse and complex, with some populations managed as 'game' and others as 'pests'. Implementation of cost-effective management strategies that account for this complexity is hindered by a lack of knowledge of the nature, extent and severity of deer impacts. To clarify the knowledge base and identify research needs, we conducted a systematic review of the impacts and management of wild deer in Australia. Most wild deer are in south-eastern Australia, but bioclimatic analysis suggested that four species are well suited to the tropical and subtropical climates of northern Australia. Deer could potentially occupy most of the continent, including parts of the arid interior. The most significant impacts are likely to occur through direct effects of herbivory, with potentially cascading indirect effects on fauna and ecosystem processes. However, evidence of impacts in Australia is largely observational, and few studies have experimentally partitioned the impacts of deer from those of sympatric native and other introduced herbivores. Furthermore, there has been little rigorous testing of the efficacy of deer management in Australia, and our understanding of the deer ecology required to guide deer management is limited. We identified the following six priority research areas: (i) identifying long-term changes in plant communities caused by deer; (ii) understanding interactions with other fauna; (iii) measuring impacts on water quality; (iv) assessing economic impacts on agriculture (including as disease vectors); (v) evaluating efficacy of management for mitigating deer impacts; and (vi) quantifying changes in distribution and abundance. Addressing these knowledge gaps will assist the development and prioritisation of cost-effective management strategies and help increase stakeholder support for managing the impacts of deer on Australian ecosystems.

TI  - EVALUATION OF ALTERNATE METHODS OF RAPID ASSESSMENT OF ENDEMICITY OF ONCHOCERCA-VOLVULUS IN COMMUNITIES IN SOUTHERN CAMEROON
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Potential diagnostic indicators of onchocerciasis (subcutaneous nodules, depigmentation or leopard skin, microfilaruria, diethylcarbamazine patch test positivity, excoriations, and pruritus) were evaluated in a rain forest region of southern Cameroon for usefulness in rapid assessment of onchocerciasis endemicity in communities. Thirty-two study villages were selected, representing high, intermediate, and low prevalence levels, and 846 adult male residents of these communities 20 or more years of age were examined according to a defined protocol. Skin snips (from each iliac crest) served as the reference standard. Skin snip positivity was 75.5%; the effect of age was minimal. Leopard skin and nodules showed the strongest correlation with both the skin snip prevalence and community microfilarial load, as reflected by the adult male study population. We selected greater than or equal to 20% nodules or greater than or equal to 20% leopard skin as the most appropriate local criteria for assigning a community to high priority for control, which corresponds to a greater than or equal to 90% skin snip prevalence in adult males. While this criteria should not be applied to regions with savannah onchocerciasis, we believe the methodology can and should be used to determine appropriate diagnostic indicators for rapid assessment of Onchocerca volvulus endemicity in regions with different dynamics of transmission and clinical expression of disease.

TI  - Prevalence and genetic variability of <i>Plesiomonas</i> <i>shigelloides</i> in temperate climate surface waters of the Pannonian Plain
T2  - ARCHIVES OF BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB  - Plesiomonas shigelloides, a Gram-negative bacterium and the causative agent of intestinal diseases and extraintestinal infections in humans and animals, is most frequently found in aquatic environments in tropical or subtropical areas. The present study was designed to establish the prevalence and genetic variability of P. shigelloides in surface waters (lakes, rivers, ponds, inlets and canals) located in a temperate climate zone, namely the Pannonian Plain of the northern part of Serbia and southern part of Hungary. The strains were isolated directly by plating samples on inositol-brilliant green-bile agar with neutral red or phenol red as indicators. Our results indicate that phenol red effectively facilitates differentiation of P. shigelloides from other bacteria. A number of samples were enriched using alkaline peptone water broth, peptone inositolbile broth and tetrathionate broth. The recovery of the isolates was more successful with the first medium. Out of a total of 51 water samples collected from 28 different locations, 22 samples (43.1%) were found positive for P. shigelloides. Among the 37 isolated strains, 34 were from lakes (Satrinci, Ludas, Panonija, Krivaja, Pecs, Kapetanski rit, Pavlovci, Kovacsszenaja, Dobrodol, Vranjas, Borkovac, Hermann Otto, Sot, Selevrenac, Zobnatica, Palic, Orfui, Jarkovci, Conoplja) and 3 were from rivers (Danube, Sava). The strains were identified by phenotypic characteristic or by the VITEK2 system and confirmed by PCR using 23S rRNA species-specific oligos. The strains showed a high genetic variability, displaying a variety of RAPD profiles. Our results reveal for the first time a high prevalence of genetically diverse P. shigelloides populations in surface waters located in the temperate climate of central and southeastern Europe.

Over the last 30 years, Chagas disease has expanded from a neglected parasitic infection of the rural population to an urbanized chronic disease, becoming a potentially emergent global health problem. T. cruzistrains were assigned to seven genetic groups (TcI-TcVI and TcBat), named discrete typing units (DTUs), which represent a set of isolates that differ in virulence, pathogenicity and immunological features. Indeed, diverse clinical manifestations (from asymptomatic to highly severe disease) have been attempted to be related to T.cruzi genetic variability. Due to that, several DTU typing methods have been introduced. Each method has its own advantages and drawbacks such as high complexity and analysis time and all of them are based on genetic signatures. Recently, a novel method discriminated bacterial strains using a peptide identification-free, genome sequence-independent shotgun proteomics workflow. Here, we aimed to develop a Trypanosoma cruzi Strain Typing Assay using MS/MS peptide spectral libraries, named TcSTAMS2.
   Methods/Principal findings
   The Tc-STAMS2 method uses shotgun proteomics combined with spectral library search to assign and discriminate T. cruzistrains independently on the genome knowledge. The method is based on the construction of a library of MS/MS peptide spectra built using genotyped T. cruzi reference strains. For identification, the MS/MS peptide spectra of unknown T. cruzi cells are identified using the spectral matching algorithm SpectraST. The Tc-STAMS2 method allowed correct identification of all DTUs with high confidence. The method was robust towards different sample preparations, length of chromatographic gradients and fragmentation techniques. Moreover, a pilot inter-laboratory study showed the applicability to different MS platforms.
   Conclusions and significance
   This is the first study that develops a MS-based platform for T. cruzi strain typing. Indeed, the Tc-STAMS2 method allows T. cruzistrain typing using MS/MS spectra as discriminatory features and allows the differentiation of Tcl-TcVI DTUs. Similar to genomic-based strategies, the Tc-STAMS2 method allows identification of strains within DTUs. Its robustness towards different experimental and biological variables makes it a valuable complementary strategy to the current T. cruzi genotyping assays. Moreover, this method can be used to identify DTU-specific features correlated with the strain phenotype.

TI  - Mouse models of alphavirus-induced inflammatory disease
T2  - JOURNAL OF GENERAL VIROLOGY
AB  - Part of the Togaviridae family, alphaviruses are arthropod-borne viruses that are widely distributed throughout the globe. Alphaviruses are able to infect a variety of vertebrate hosts, but in humans, infection can result in extensive morbidity and mortality. Symptomatic infection can manifest as fever, an erythematous rash and/or significant inflammatory pathologies such as arthritis and encephalitis. Recent overwhelming outbreaks of alphaviral disease have highlighted the void in our understanding of alphavirus pathogenesis and the re-emergence of alphaviruses has given new impetus to anti-alphaviral drug design. In this review, the development of viable mouse models of Old Word and New World alphaviruses is examined. How mouse models that best replicate human disease have been used to elucidate the immunopathology of alphavirus pathogenesis and trial novel therapeutic discoveries is also discussed.

TI  - Onchocercal eye disease and the impact of Mectizan treatment
T2  - ANNALS OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND PARASITOLOGY
AB  - Onchocerciasis continues to be a major cause of blindness, particularly in those sub-Saharan African countries which are outside the area of West Africa monitored by the Onchocerciasis Control Programme (OCP). Onchocercal ocular disease and blindness develop as a result of long exposure to onchocercal infection. Until 1987, suramin and diethylcarbamazine were the only drugs available for the treatment of onchocerciasis and they could not be used for community therapy because of their toxicity and the dosage schedules required. The registration of Mectizan (ivermectin, MSD) for treatment of human onchocerciasis in 1987, and the donation of this drug by Merck & Co. for as long as it is needed, provided a new opportunity for the safe treatment and control of the disease.
   The data available on the impact of repeated doses of Mectizan on ocular onchocercal disease indicate a significant reduction of ocular microfilarial loads and regression of early lesions of the anterior segment, including iridocyclitis and sclerosing keratitis. Such improvements are seen more rapidly when Mectizan is used than when onchocerciasis is limited by vector control alone. Mectizan treatment also has a beneficial effect on onchocercal optic-nerve disease and visual-field loss. Long-term maintenance of Mectizan therapy should lead to a reduction in the prevalence of blindness in endemic communities.

TI  - Frugivory and seed dispersal in a hyperdiverse plant clade and its role as a keystone resource for the Neotropical fauna
T2  - ANNALS OF BOTANY
AB  - Background and Aims Much of our understanding of the ecology and evolution of seed dispersal in the Neotropics is founded on studies involving the animal-dispersed, hyperdiverse plant clade Miconia (Melastomataceae). Nonetheless, no formal attempt has been made to establish its relevance as a model system or indeed provide evidence of the role of frugivores as Miconia seed dispersers.
   Methods We built three Miconia databases (fruit phenology/diaspore traits, fruit-frugivore interactions and effects on seed germination after gut passage) to determine how Miconia fruiting phenology and fruit traits for >350 species interact with and shape patterns of frugivore selection. In addition, we conducted a meta-analysis evaluating the effects of animal gut passage/seed handling on Miconia germination.
   Key Results Miconia produce numerous small berries that enclose numerous tiny seeds within water- and sugar-rich pulps. In addition, coexisting species provide sequential, year long availability of fruits within communities, with many species producing fruits in periods of resource scarcity. From 2396 pairwise interactions, we identified 646 animal frugivore species in five classes, 22 orders and 60 families, including birds, mammals, reptiles, fish and ants that consume Miconia fruits. Endozoochory is the main dispersal mechanism, but gut passage effects on germination were specific to animal clades; birds, monkeys and ants reduced seed germination percentages, while opossums increased it.
   Conclusions The sequential fruiting phenologies and wide taxonomic and functional diversity of animal vectors associated with Miconia fruits underscore the likely keystone role that this plant clade plays in the Neotropics. By producing fruits morphologically and chemically accessible to a variety of animals, Miconia species ensure short- and long-distance seed dispersal and constitute reliable resources that sustain entire frugivore assemblages.

TI  - A shift in resting habitat and feeding behavior of <i>Anopheles</i> <i>fluviatilis</i> sibling species in the Keonjhar district of Odisha, India
T2  - TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Background: Anopheles fluviatilis exists as a complex of sibling species S, T, U and V exhibiting distinct variations. Sibling species S is considered as the main vector and anthropogenic whereas T, U and V are zoophagic nonvectors. This study was performed in a forested village of Keonjhar district, Odisha to identify the status of An. fluviatilis sibling species.
   Methods: Mosquito collections were made from cattle sheds (CS), human dwellings (HD) and mixed dwellings (MD) from June 2012 to May 2013. The proportion of An. fluviatilis collected from different habitats was compared with An. culicifacies. PCR assays were conducted to reveal their sibling species composition, host preference and sporozoite rate.
   Results: Anopheles fluviatilis was the dominant species followed by An. culicifacies. The relative proportion of collection was high in MD and HD for An. fluviatilis and An. culicifacies respectively. PCR assay confirmed 9.4% S and 75.5% T. Mean collection of sibling species T and S were significantly high in MD and HD. Human blood index (HBI) of 0.88 and 0.61 was confirmed for sibling species S and T respectively with 13% sporozoite rate for S.
   Conclusions: High density of the sibling T was found in the study site with a shift in resting habitat and blood feeding preference.

TI  - Highly heterogeneous residual malaria risk in western Thailand
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY
AB  - Over the past decades, the malaria burden in Thailand has substantially declined. Most infections now originate from the national border regions. In these areas, the prevalence of asymptomatic infections is still substantial and poses a challenge for the national malaria elimination program. To determine epidemiological parameters as well as risk factors for malaria infection in western Thailand, we carried out a cohort study in Kanchanaburi and Ratchaburi provinces on the Thailand-Myanmar border. Blood samples from 999 local participants were examined for malaria infection every 4 weeks between May 2013 and Jun 2014. Prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax was determined by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and showed a seasonal variation with values fluctuating from 1.7% to 4.2% for P. vivax and 0% to 1.3% for P. falciparum. Ninety percent of infections were asymptomatic. The annual molecular force of blood-stage infection (molFOB) was estimated by microsatellite genotyping to be 0.24 new infections per person-year for P. vivax and 0.02 new infections per person-year for P. falciparum. The distribution of infections was heterogenous, that is, the vast majority of infections (>80%) were found in a small number of individuals (<8% of the study population) who tested positive at multiple timepoints. Significant risk factors were detected for P. vivax infections, including previous clinical malaria, occupation in agriculture and travel to Myanmar. In contrast, indoor residual spraying was associated with a protection from infection. These findings provide a recent landscape of malaria epidemiology and emphasize the importance of novel strategies to target asymptomatic and imported infections.

TI  - Environmental predictors of filarial infection in Amazonian primates Ecological factors and primate filarial infection
T2  - ACTA TROPICA
AB  - Filarial nematode infections are common in primates, but have received little attention in the Neotropics. Epidemiological data on filarial infections in primates are still too sparse to fully understand the complex of this parasitism, especially because of the difficulty in studying the ecology and epidemiology of wild primates.. We describe natural infections by Dipetalonema parasitizing 211 primates belonging to eight free-living primate genera in Amazonia, and assess the relationships between parasitic indicators and climatic (rainfall and river level), ecological (fruiting periods of plants) and biological (sex, species' body mass, group size and density) factors. The overall prevalence was 64.4% (95% CI: 64.0 - 64.9); parasitic mean abundance (N filariae per individual) and parasitic mean intensity (N filariae per infected host) of infection were 11.9 (95% CI: 8.3 - 15.6) and 18.4 (95% CI: 13.4 - 23.4) filariae/individual, respectively. Although we observed differences in parasitic parameters among primate genera, there was no correlation between parasitic parameters with density, body mass or group size. Sapajus, Cebus and Lagothrix had the highest prevalence and parasitic mean intensity. Using Lagothrix lagotricha poeppigii, the most sampled species (n = 92), as a model, we found that the number of filariae per infected host was associated with fruit production in swamp forests during the dry season, the time of food scarcity. The long periods of food shortage may cause environmental stress on primates, impairing their immune defenses and leading to increased parasite load but not affecting infection prevalence. However, the lack of information on vector ecology, key to understand risk factors associated to infection rate, prevents confirming the existence of an infection pattern dependent on food availability.

TI  - Topography and crop management are key factors for the development of American leaf spot epidemics on coffee in Costa Rica
T2  - PHYTOPATHOLOGY
AB  - We monitored the development of American leaf spot of coffee, a disease caused by the gemmiferous fungus Mycena citricolor, in 57 plots in Costa Rica for I or 2 years in order to gain a clearer understanding of conditions conducive to the disease and improve its control. During the investigation, characteristics of the coffee trees, crop management, and the environment were recorded. For the analyses, we used partial least-squares regression via the spline functions (PLSS), which is a nonlinear extension to partial least-squares regression (PLS). The fungus developed well in areas located between approximate to 1,100 and 1,550 m above sea level. Slopes were conducive to its development, but eastern-facing slopes were less affected than the others, probably because they were more exposed to sunlight, especially in the rainy season. The distance between planting rows, the shade percentage, coffee tree height, the type of shade, and the pruning system explained disease intensity due to their effects on coffee tree shading and, possibly, on the humidity conditions in the plot. Forest trees and fruit trees intercropped with coffee provided particularly propitious conditions. Apparently, fertilization was unfavorable for the disease, probably due to dilution phenomena associated with faster coffee tree growth. Finally, series of wet spells interspersed with dry spells, which were frequent in the middle of the rainy season, were critical for the disease, probably because they affected the production and release of gemmae and their viability. These results could be used to draw up a map of epidemic risks taking topographical factors into account. To reduce those risks and improve chemical control, our results suggested that farmers should space planting rows further apart, maintain light shading in the plantation, and prime their coffee trees.

TI  - Biodiversity conservation: The key is reducing meat consumption
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - The consumption of animal-sourced food products by humans is one of the most powerful negative forces affecting the conservation of terrestrial ecosystems and biological diversity. Livestock production is the single largest driver of habitat loss, and both livestock and feedstock production are increasing in developing tropical countries where the majority of biological diversity resides. Bushmeat consumption in Africa and southeastern Asia, as well as the high growth-rate of per capita livestock consumption in China are of special concern. The projected land base required by 2050 to support livestock production in several megadiverse countries exceeds 30-50% of their current agricultural areas. Livestock production is also a leading cause of climate change, soil loss, water and nutrient pollution, and decreases of apex predators and wild herbivores, compounding pressures on ecosystems and biodiversity. It is possible to greatly reduce the impacts of animal product consumption by humans on natural ecosystems and biodiversity while meeting nutritional needs of people, including the projected 2-3 billion people to be added to human population. We suggest that impacts can be remediated through several solutions: (1) reducing demand for animal-based food products and increasing proportions of plant-based foods in diets, the latter ideally to a global average of 90% of food consumed; (2) replacing ecologically-inefficient ruminants (e.g. cattle, goats, sheep) and bushmeat with monogastrics (e.g. poultry, pigs), integrated aquaculture, and other more-efficient protein sources; and (3) reintegrating livestock production away from single-product, intensive, fossil-fuel based systems into diverse, coupled systems designed more closely around the structure and functions of ecosystems that conserve energy and nutrients. Such efforts would also impart positive impacts on human health through reduction of diseases of nutritional extravagance. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - The productivity of small animal species in small-scale mixed farming systems in subtropical Bolivia
T2  - TROPICAL ANIMAL HEALTH AND PRODUCTION
AB  - The productivity of the scavenging, small animal species (chickens, ducks, pigs, hair sheep and guinea-pigs) commonly found on small-scale farms at the forest margin in subtropical Bolivia was monitored over a full year. Chickens and guinea-pigs were kept mainly for home consumption, while ducks and pigs were kept mainly for sale. Sheep served both purposes, depending upon the family requirements. In the absence of veterinary treatment, the productivity varied greatly between farms. Pigs gave the greatest gross return, but received the largest amount of supplementary feed. Under the existing system, chickens, ducks and sheep all gave similar gross returns per breeding female, although chickens produced good returns and made a large contribution to the family diet where the reproductive efficiency was high and the chick mortality was low. Mortality resulting from disease was a major problem in poultry, while internal parasites appeared to be important limiting factors in pigs and sheep. Guinea-pigs showed no major problems apart from theft, and were an important dietary component for immigrant families from the highlands of the country. Small animal species have largely been ignored by agricultural research and development activities in Bolivia and elsewhere. They currently make significant contributions to the livelihoods of poor people in terms of both income and food security, and this could be greatly increased by simple improvements in animal husbandry.

TI  - Effect of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) on GIS-Enabled Bivariate and Multivariate Statistical Models for Landslide Susceptibility Mapping
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
AB  - In this study, the effect of NDVI is observed on the landslide susceptibility maps (LSMs) being created using GIS-based bivariate and multivariate statistical models such as frequency ratio (FR), information value (IoV), multiple linear regression (MLR), and logistic regression (LR) based on the 108 training and 56 testing landslide points and ten causative factors. The accuracy of the LSM produced was highest for the IoV model with and without considering the NDVI as a causative factor; however, the accuracy of each of the models was increased when NDVI was considered, i.e., for the FR model, the AUC was increased from 0.85 to 0.92, while for MLR model the AUC value increased from 0.86 to 0.90 and0.84 to 0.92 for LR model. Additionally, the distances closer to the road and streams, jointed and fragmented rock strata, western direction aspect were more likely to experience landslides. We, therefore, suggest using NDVI as a causative factor in the LSM preparation while working in dense vegetation and tropical areas.

TI  - Fungicide Sensitivity of <i>Sclerotinia sclerotiorum</i> from US Soybean and Dry Bean, Compared to Different Regions and Climates
T2  - PLANT DISEASE
AB  - Fungicide use is integral to reduce yield loss from Sclerotinia sclerotiorum on dry bean and soybean. Increasing fungicide use against this fungus may lead to resistance to the most common fungicides. Resistance has been reported in Brazil (Glycine max) and China (Brassica napus subsp. napus), however, few studies have investigated fungicide sensitivity of S. sclerotiorum in the United States. This work was conducted to determine if there was a difference in fungicide sensitivity of S. sclerotiorum isolates in the United States from: (i) dry bean versus soybean and (ii) fields with different frequencies of fungicide application. We further hypothesized that isolates with fungicide applications of a single active ingredient from tropical Brazil and subtropical Mexico were less sensitive than temperate U.S. isolates due to different management practices and climates. The EC50(D) fungicide sensitivity of 512 S. sclerotiorum isolates from the United States (443), Brazil (36), and Mexico (33) was determined using a discriminatory concentration (DC) previously identified for tetraconazole (2.0 ppm; EC50(D) range of 0.197 to 2.27 ppm), boscalid (0.2; 0.042 to 0.222), picoxystrobin (0.01; 0.006 to 0.027), and thiophanate-methyl, which had a qualitative DC of 10 ppm. Among the 10 least sensitive isolates to boscalid and picoxystrobin, 2 presented mutations known to confer resistance in the SdhB (qualitative) and SdhC (quantitative) genes; however, no strong resistance was found. This study established novel DCs that can be used for further resistance monitoring and baseline sensitivity of S. sclerotiorum to tetraconazole worldwide plus baseline sensitivity to boscalid in the United States.

TI  - Ecological Suitability and Spatial Distribution of Five <i>Anopheles</i> Species in Amazonian Brazil
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Seventy-six sites characterized in Amazonian Brazil revealed distinct habitat diversification by examining the environmental factors associated with the distribution and abundance of five anopheline species (Diptera: Culicidae) in the subgenus Nyssorhynchus. These included three members of the Albitarsis Complex, Anopheles oryzalimnetes, Anopheles marajoara, Anopheles janconnae; Anopheles triannulatus, and Anopheles goeldii. Anopheles janconnae abundance had a positive correlation to water flow and a negative relationship to sun exposure. Abundance of An. oryzalimentes was associated with water chemistry. Anopheles goeldii larvae were abundant in shaded, more saline waters. Anopheles marajoara and An. triannulatus were negatively associated with available resources, although An. marajoara also showed several local correlations. These analyses suggest An. triannulattts is a habitat generalist, An. oryzalimentes and An. janconnae are specialists, and An. marajoara and An. goeldii could not be easily classified either way. Correlations described herein provide testable hypotheses for future research and identifying habitats for vector control.

TI  - Onchocerciasis: the burden of disease
T2  - ANNALS OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND PARASITOLOGY
AB  - The greatest burdens related to human onchocerciasis are the result of the eye and skin lesions and severe itching produced by the microfilariae. Although the major manifestations of the disease do show geographical variation (e.g. onchocercal blindness is not a common complication in all endemic countries), they are often sufficiently severe to prevent human use of the often very fertile land close to the rivers in which the vectors breed.
   Though for many years thought to be of relatively minor importance compared with onchocercal eye disease, the skin lesions of onchocerciasis have recently been shown to be a major socio-economic burden, in terms of disability-adjusted life-years.
   The demonstration of an excellent correlation between the prevalence of palpable nodules in a community and the community microfilarial load has led to the development of rapid, safe and non-invasive methods to assess and map the levels of endemicity across whole countries. This has enabled mass treatment with Mectizan (ivermectin, MSD) to be targeted first at hyperendemic communities.
   Estimates of the burden of onchocerciasis will continue to change as better means of measurement become available. It seems possible, however, that use of Mectizan will eliminate the disease before its true burden can be estimated accurately.

TI  - Modeling the environmental suitability of anthrax in Ghana and estimating populations at risk: Implications for vaccination and control
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Anthrax is hyper-endemic in West Africa. Despite the effectiveness of livestock vaccines in controlling anthrax, underreporting, logistics, and limited resources makes implementing vaccination campaigns difficult. To better understand the geographic limits of anthrax, elucidate environmental factors related to its occurrence, and identify human and livestock populations at risk, we developed predictive models of the environmental suitability of anthrax in Ghana. We obtained data on the location and date of livestock anthrax from veterinary and outbreak response records in Ghana during 2005-2016, as well as livestock vaccination registers and population estimates of characteristically high-risk groups. To predict the environmental suitability of anthrax, we used an ensemble of random forest (RF) models built using a combination of climatic and environmental factors. From 2005 through the first six months of 2016, there were 67 anthrax outbreaks (851 cases) in livestock; outbreaks showed a seasonal peak during February through April and primarily involved cattle. There was a median of 19,709 vaccine doses [range: 0-175 thousand] administered annually. Results from the RF model suggest a marked ecological divide separating the broad areas of environmental suitability in northern Ghana from the southern part of the country. Increasing alkaline soil pH was associated with a higher probability of anthrax occurrence. We estimated 2.2 (95% CI: 2.0, 2.5) million livestock and 805 (95% CI: 519, 890) thousand low income rural livestock keepers were located in anthrax risk areas. Based on our estimates, the current anthrax vaccination efforts in Ghana cover a fraction of the livestock potentially at risk, thus control efforts should be focused on improving vaccine coverage among high risk groups.

TI  - Seasonal fluctuations of small mammal and flea communities in a Ugandan plague focus: evidence to implicate <i>Arvicanthis niloticus</i> and <i>Crocidura spp</i>. as key hosts in <i>Yersinia pestis</i> transmission
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
AB  - Background: The distribution of human plague risk is strongly associated with rainfall in the tropical plague foci of East Africa, but little is known about how the plague bacterium is maintained during periods between outbreaks or whether environmental drivers trigger these outbreaks. We collected small mammals and fleas over a two year period in the West Nile region of Uganda to examine how the ecological community varies seasonally in a region with areas of both high and low risk of human plague cases.
   Methods: Seasonal changes in the small mammal and flea communities were examined along an elevation gradient to determine whether small mammal and flea populations exhibit differences in their response to seasonal fluctuations in precipitation, temperature, and crop harvests in areas within (above 1300 m) and outside (below 1300 m) of a model-defined plague focus.
   Results: The abundance of two potential enzootic host species (Arvicanthis niloticus and Crocidura spp.) increased during the plague season within the plague focus, but did not show the same increase at lower elevations outside this focus. In contrast, the abundance of the domestic rat population (Rattus rattus) did not show significant seasonal fluctuations regardless of locality. Arvicanthis niloticus abundance was negatively associated with monthly precipitation at a six month lag and positively associated with current monthly temperatures, and Crocidura spp. abundance was positively associated with precipitation at a three month lag and negatively associated with current monthly temperatures. The abundance of A. niloticus and Crocidura spp. were both positively correlated with the harvest of millet and maize.
   Conclusions: The association between the abundance of several small mammal species and rainfall is consistent with previous models of the timing of human plague cases in relation to precipitation in the West Nile region. The seasonal increase in the abundance of key potential host species within the plague focus, but not outside of this area, suggests that changes in small mammal abundance may create favorable conditions for epizootic transmission of Y. pestis which ultimately may increase risk of human cases in this region.

TI  - Kawasaki disease presenting with hemorrhagic pleural effusion
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL PEDIATRICS
AB  - Hemorrhagic pleural effusion associated with Kawasaki disease (KD) is very rare and has not been reported in the medical literature. We describe a 5-year-old male with incomplete (atypical) KD who presented with fever and severe respiratory distress due to bilateral pleural effusions. Other features included unilateral cervical lymphadenopathy, swelling of the hands and feet followed by periungual desquamation, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, thrombocytosis and sterile pyuria. Pleural fluid analysis revealed a hemorrhagic exudative effusion. Therapy with high-dose i.v. immunoglobulin resulted in dramatic clinical improvement and resolution of pleural effusion. An echocardiogram obtained at presentation and at 6 weeks of illness was normal. Pediatricians should be aware that hemorrhagic pleural effusion can be a presenting manifestation of KD.

TI  - Influences of climate variability on cocoa health and productivity in agroforestry systems in Ghana
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
AB  - The susceptibility of cocoa to harsh climatic conditions is evident in cocoa growing areas in Ghana, and climate distribution models show reduced cocoa suitability to climate change. We assessed how cocoa health and productivity were affected by varying climate conditions for 4 years in 23 cocoa farms along a gradient of low rainfall/high temperature in the north to high rainfall/low temperature in the south of Ghana's cocoa belts. Twenty cocoa trees per farm (in total 460) were observed and scored for their canopy condition, flower intensity, and damaged pods due to mirids, cocoa shield bugs, and black pod disease (BPD). Harvested pods and extracted dried cocoa beans were evaluated to ascertain yield/productivity. Insect pest damages to pods were on average 2.3 +/- 0.8, 2.2 +/- 1.0, and 3.0 +/- 0.7 pods tree-1 year-1 in the south, middle and north, respectively. The healthiest and highest yielding trees were in the rainy south at 0.99 +/- 0.02 kg dry beans tree- 1 followed by the middle (0.84 +/- 0.02 kg) and the north (0.60 +/- 0.01 kg). BPD infection was highest in the south at 1.1 +/- 1.1 pods tree- 1 year-1, followed by the middle (0.7 +/- 0.8), and the north (0.4 +/- 0.6). Within sites variability in rainfall and temperature was not found to affect yields significantly. The variability in cocoa performance and occurrence of pests and diseases observed within sites may thus be caused by farm management practices that are key to the enhancement of productivity at site level. We recommend regular pruning of cocoa and shade trees to increase aeration and prevent BPD in high rainfall areas, and an increase in shade tree components in dry regions for insect pest management in cocoa systems.

TI  - <i>Ficus</i>plants: State of the art from a phytochemical, pharmacological, and toxicological perspective
T2  - PHYTOTHERAPY RESEARCH
AB  - Ficusgenus is typically tropical plants and is among the earliest fruit trees cultivated by humans.Ficus caricaL. is the common fig,Ficus benjaminaL. is the weeping fig, andFicus pumilaL. is the creeping fig. These species are commonly used in traditional medicine for a wide range of diseases and contain rich secondary metabolites that have shown diverse applications. This comprehensive review describes forFicusgenus the phytochemical compounds, traditional uses and contemporary pharmacological activities such as antioxidant, cytotoxic, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, antiulcer, and anticonvulsant. An extended survey of the current literature (Science Direct, Scopus, PubMed) has been carried out as part of the current work. The trends in the phytochemistry, pharmacological mechanisms and activities ofFicusgenus are overviewed in this manuscript: antimicrobial, antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity, antiseizure and anti-Parkinson's diseases, cytotoxic and antioxidant. Health-promoting effects, recent human clinical studies, safety and adverse effects ofFicusplants also are covered. The medical potential and long-term pharmacotherapeutic use of the genusFicusalong with no serious reported adverse events, suggests that it can be considered as being safe.

TI  - Genetic exchange as a possible source of genomic diversity in sylvatic populations of Trypanosoma cruzi
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Thirty six stocks of Trypanosoma cruzi isolated from sylvatic mammals (32 Didelphis marsupialis and one Philander opossum) and triatomine bugs (Rhodnius robustus and one unidentified bug) in the Amazonian forest of Carajas, Brazil were characterized by isoenzyme and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis as belonging to principal zymodeme 1 (Z1). Two different homozygous phenotypes and the corresponding heterozygous phenotype were found for phosphoglucomutase with an observed frequency almost identical with that predicted by the theoretical Hardy-Weinberg distribution. Parental and hybrid profiles were also suggested by RAPD analysis, which allowed exclusion of mixed parental strains from the hybrids: isoenzyme and RAPD profiles of biological clones were also indistinguishable from those of uncloned stocks. Trypanosoma cruzi stocks from widely separated geographic origins in Central and South America gave similar RAPD profiles that allowed them to be recognized as being Z1. These results indicate that genetic exchange could contribute to the generation of genetic diversity during the sylvatic cycle of T. cruzi, and this may have epidemiologic and taxonomic implications.

TI  - Potential geo-tracing tool for migrant insects by using 16S rDNA fingerprinting of bacterial communities by PCR-DGGE
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TROPICAL INSECT SCIENCE
AB  - Insect movement in the landscape remains often poorly known and in some cases does not make it possible to understand the role of the different cultivated and wild habitats in the dynamics of useful and pest insects. Insects are among the greatest pests of agriculture, horticulture and forestry worldwide, inflicting damage and economic costs both directly and by transmitting plant viruses. There is a need for tracking the migrant insects in agroecosystems through space and time to establish their migation. Furthermore, tracing the origin of pest insects allows to design more rapid, efficient and environment-friendly control systems (less use of insecticides). Tracking insects can also help us better understanding their biology (e.g. insect population dynamics, geo-traceability, feeding behavior and other ecological interactions). However. tracking insects presents a considerable challenge as they are often small, cryptic and highly mobile organisms. The most common methods of analysis currently proposed (microsatellite markers, stable isotopes) do not allow for the moment to determine their geographical origin. The ecological niche occupied by the insects highly influences the bacterial communities associated with the insects. Hence understanding the diversity of bacterial communities could be an option to trace the orgins of the pest. This paper presents two new protocols used to extract bacterial DNA from the Cotton Bollworm. Helicoverpa armigera and the analysis of this DNA by PCR-DGGE. This promising method is proposed as a new traceability tool which provides insects with a unique biological barcode and makes it possible to trace back the insects to their original location.

TI  - Pollination of Bactris guineensis (Arecaceae), a potential economically exploitable fruit palm from the Colombian Caribbean
T2  - FLORA
AB  - Regardless of the ecological and economical importance of palms, their pollination strategies and the identities of their true pollinators are still contentious subjects. Bactris guineensis grows in open areas in lowland Caribbean Colombia. Its fruits have long been an important component of local economy and are now targeted for broader scale production for the Colombian market. We explored details of the reproductive biology of B. guineensis in its natural environment to understand the various elements of pollen flow dynamics that ensure optimal fruit yield. During two consecutive years, we investigated the phenology, floral biology and pollination ecology of a wild population of B. guineensis in the department of Sucre, northern Colombia. Monthly production of buds, in- florescences and ripe infructescences were quantified. Pollen carrying capacity, efficiency and fidelity of an- thophilous insect species associated with B. guineensis were calculated and used to define their role as effective pollinators. Bactris guineensis is protogynous and exhibits ephemeral nocturnal anthesis. In spite of strict xeno- gamy the average reproductive success was over 75%, attributed to high pollen vector efficiency. Twenty-seven insect species representing three orders were recorded as floral visitors, but the only effective pollinators were minute flower weevils and sap beetles. At the beginning of the female phase of anthesis, when pistillate flowers are receptive, inflorescences of B. guineensis warm up to over 12 degrees C above ambient air and emit a balsamic scent, attracting swarms of several hundred to thousands of beetles loaded with pollen. A second, shorter -lasting floral heating event takes place by dusk in the following day (or the male phase), which culminates with pollen shedding of staminate flowers and departure of the pollinators. Anthesis events that are highly synchronized with activity patterns of specialized scent -oriented pollinators ensure the high reproductive success of B. gui- neensis at our study site. Plans for large scale production should prioritize insect -friendly practices and in- vestigation on the role of volatile floral kairomones for pollinator attraction.

TI  - Fungal communities in feces of the frugivorous bat <i>Ectophylla alba</i> and its highly specialized <i>Ficus colubrinae</i> diet
T2  - ANIMAL MICROBIOME
AB  - Background Bats are important long-distance dispersers of many tropical plants, yet, by consuming fruits, they may disperse not only the plant's seeds, but also the mycobiota within those fruits. We characterized the culture-dependent and independent fungal communities in fruits of Ficus colubrinae and feces of Ectophylla alba to determine if passage through the digestive tract of bats affected the total mycobiota. Results Using presence/absence and normalized abundance data from fruits and feces, we demonstrate that the fungal communities were significantly different, even though there was an overlap of ca. 38% of Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs). We show that some of the fungi from fruits were also present and grew from fecal samples. Fecal fungal communities were dominated by Agaricomycetes, followed by Dothideomycetes, Sordariomycetes, Eurotiomycetes, and Malasseziomycetes, while fruit samples were dominated by Dothideomycetes, followed by Sordariomycetes, Agaricomycetes, Eurotiomycetes, and Laboulbeniomycetes. Linear discriminant analyses (LDA) show that, for bat feces, the indicator taxa include Basidiomycota (i.e., Agaricomycetes: Polyporales and Agaricales), and the ascomycetous class Eurotiomycetes (i.e., Eurotiales, Aspergillaceae). For fruits, indicator taxa are in the Ascomycota (i.e., Dothideomycetes: Botryosphaeriales; Laboulbeniomycetes: Pyxidiophorales; and Sordariomycetes: Glomerellales). In our study, the differences in fungal species composition between the two communities (fruits vs. feces) reflected on the changes in the functional diversity. For example, the core community in bat feces is constituted by saprobes and animal commensals, while that of fruits is composed mostly of phytopathogens and arthropod-associated fungi. Conclusions Our study provides the groundwork to continue disentangling the direct and indirect symbiotic relationships in an ecological network that has not received enough attention: fungi-plants-bats. Findings also suggest that the role of frugivores in plant-animal mutualistic networks may extend beyond seed dispersal: they may also promote the dispersal of potentially beneficial microbial symbionts while, for example, hindering those that can cause plant disease.

TI  - Molecular signatures of sexual communication in the phlebotomine sand flies
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Phlebotomine sand flies employ an elaborate system of pheromone communication wherein males produce pheromones that attracts other males to leks (thus acting as aggregation pheromone) and females to the lekking males (sex pheromone). In addition, the type of pheromone produced varies among populations. Despite the numerous studies on sand fly chemical communication, little is known of their chemosensory genome. Chemoreceptors interact with chemicals in an organism's environment to elicit essential behaviors such as the identification of suitable mates and food sources, thus, they play important roles during adaptation and speciation. Major chemoreceptor gene families, odorant receptors (ORs), gustatory receptors (GRs) and ionotropic receptors (IRs) together detect and discriminate the chemical landscape. Here, we annotated the chemoreceptor repertoire in the genomes of Lutzomyia longipalpis and Phlebotomus papatasi, major phlebotomine vectors in the New World and Old World, respectively. Comparison with other sequenced Diptera revealed a large and unique expansion where over 80% of the similar to 140 ORs belong to a single, taxonomically restricted clade. We next conducted comprehensive analysis of the chemoreceptors in 63 Lu. longipalpis individuals from four different locations in Brazil representing allopatric and sympatric populations and three sex-aggregation pheromone types (chemotypes). Population structure based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and gene copy number in the chemoreceptors corresponded with their putative chemotypes, and corroborate previous studies that identified multiple populations. Our work provides genomic insights into the underlying behavioral evolution of sexual communication in the L. longipalpis species complex in Brazil, and highlights the importance of accounting for the ongoing speciation in central and South American Lutzomyia that could have important implications for vectorial capacity.
   Author summary
   Phlebotomine sand flies are the primary vectors of Leishmania parasites, the causative agents of cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis. Due to the lack of vaccines, control of leishmaniasis relies upon reducing human exposure to sand flies. Sand flies produce sex-aggregation pheromones that elicit robust olfactory behaviors, and the molecular targets for pheromone detection remain unknown. We identified chemoreceptors in the genomes of L. longipalpis and P. papatasi, and used these gene models to explore chemoreceptor evolution in 63 L. longipalpis individuals representing different pheromone types. These analyses identified genomic loci underlying chemosensory behavior in sand flies. This paves the way for understanding the sand fly species diversity at the molecular level, and functional characterization of these candidate genes will isolate and identify chemostimuli that can directly be tested as potential attractants for odor baited traps.

TI  - Estimating leaf mass per area and equivalent water thickness based on leaf optical properties: Potential and limitations of physical modeling and machine learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Leaf mass per area (LMA) and leaf equivalent water thickness (EWT) are key leaf functional traits providing information for many applications including ecosystem functioning modeling and fire risk management. In this paper, we investigate two common conclusions generally made for LMA and EWT estimation based on leaf optical properties in the near-infrared (NIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) domains: (1) physically-based approaches estimate EWT accurately and LMA poorly, while (2) statistically-based and machine learning (ML) methods provide accurate estimates of both LMA and EWT.
   Using six experimental datasets including broadleaf species samples of >150 species collected over tropical, temperate and boreal ecosystems, we compared the performances of a physically-based method (PROSPECT model inversion) and a ML algorithm (support vector machine regression, SVM) to infer EWT and LMA based on leaf reflectance and transmittance. We assessed several merit functions to invert PROSPECT based on iterative optimization and investigated the spectral domain to be used for optimal estimation of LMA and EWT. We also tested several strategies to select the training samples used by the SVM, in order to investigate the generalization ability of the derived regression models.
   We evidenced that using spectral information from 1700 to 2400 nm leads to strong improvement in the estimation of EWT and LMA when performing a PROSPECT inversion, decreasing the LMA and EWT estimation errors by 55% and 33%, respectively.
   The comparison of various sampling strategies for the training set used with SVM suggests that regression models show limited generalization ability, particularly when the regression model is applied on data fully independent from the training set. Finally, our results demonstrate that, when using an appropriate spectral domain, the PROSPECT inversion outperforms SVM trained with experimental data for the estimation of EWT and LMA. Thus we recommend that estimation of LMA and EWT based on leaf optical properties should be physically-based using inversion of reflectance and transmittance measurements on the 1700 to 2400 nm spectral range.

TI  - An ethnobotanical study of anti-malarial plants among indigenous people on the upper Negro River in the Brazilian Amazon
T2  - JOURNAL OF ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY
AB  - Background: In this article we present the plants used for the treatment of malaria and associated symptoms in Santa Isabel do Rio Negro in the Brazilian Amazon. The region has important biological and cultural diversities including more than twenty indigenous ethnic groups and a strong history in traditional medicine.
   Objective: The aims of this study are to survey information in the Baniwa, Bare, Desana, Piratapuia, Tariana, Tukano, Tuyuca and Yanomami ethnic communities and among caboclos (mixed-ethnicity) on (a) plant species used for the treatment of malaria and associated symptoms, (b) dosage forms and (c) distribution of these antimalarial plants in the Amazon.
   Methods: Information was obtained through classical ethnobotanical and ethnopharmacological methods from interviews with 146 informants in Santa Isabel municipality on the upper Negro River, Brazil.
   Results: Fifty-five mainly native neotropical plant species from 34 families were in use. The detailed uses of these plants were documented. The result was 187 records (64.5%) of plants for the specific treatment of malaria, 51 records (17.6%) of plants used in the treatment of liver problems and 29 records (10.0%) of plants used in the control of fevers associated with malaria. Other uses described were blood fortification ('dar sangue'), headache and prophylaxis. Most of the therapeutic preparations were decoctions and infusions based on stem bark, root bark and leaves. These were administered by mouth. In some cases, remedies were prepared with up to three different plant species. Also, plants were used together with other ingredients such as insects, mammals, gunpowder and milk.
   Conclusion: This is the first study on the anti-malarial plants from this region of the Amazon. Aspidosperma spp. and Ampelozizyphus amazonicus Ducke were the most cited species in the communities surveyed. These species have experimental proof supporting their anti-malarial efficacy The dosage of the therapeutic preparations depends on the kind of plant, quantity of plant material available, the patient's age (children and adults) and the local expert. The treatment time varies from a single dose to up to several weeks. Most anti-malarial plants are domesticated or grow spontaneously. They are grown in home gardens, open areas near the communities, clearings and secondary forests, and wild species grow in areas of seasonally flooded wetlands and terra firme ('solid ground') forest, in some cases in locations that are hard to access. Traditional knowledge of plants was found to be falling into disuse presumably as a consequence of the local official health services that treat malaria in the communities using commercial drugs. Despite this, some species are used in the prevention of this disease and also in the recovery after using conventional anti-malarial drugs. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - <i>Anopheles sundaicus</i> complex and the presence of <i>Anopheles epiroticus</i> in Indonesia
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Author summary In Indonesia, more than 80 species ofAnopheleshave been documented, of which approximately 24 species are regarded as malaria vectors. Many of these mosquitoes are members of species complexes, being morphologically indistinguishable from other member sibling species. TheAnopheles sundaicuscomplex (s.l.) has a wide geographical distribution in South and Southeast Asia, and exhibits ecological and behavioural variability over its range.Anopheles sundaicuss.l. is an important malaria vector present primarily in coastal areas of western and central Indonesia. Cytologic, isozyme, and molecular methods have been used to distinguish members of the complex in Indonesia, with several species being reported in different localities. This study aims to explore the distribution of theAn.sundaicuscomplex in Indonesia using molecular methods. FemaleAnopheles sundaicuss.l. were collected from 12 localities within seven provinces in western to south-central Indonesia. The findings indicate the presence ofAn.epiroticusin North Sumatra and Bangka-Belitung archipelago off the eastern coast of central Sumatra. Further studies are required to determine the full distributional extent of theAn.sundaicuscomplex in Indonesia and investigate the role of each species in malaria transmission.
   Anopheles sundaicuss.l. is an important malaria vector primarily found in coastal landscapes of western and central Indonesia. The species complex has a wide geographical distribution in South and Southeast Asia and exhibits ecological and behavioural variability over its range. Studies on understanding the distribution of different members in the complex and their bionomics related to malaria transmission might be important guiding more effective vector intervention strategies. FemaleAn.sundaicuss.l. were collected from seven provinces, 12 locations in Indonesia representing Sumatra: North Sumatra, Bangka-Belitung, South Lampung, and Bengkulu; in Java: West Java; and the Lesser Sunda Islands: West Nusa Tenggara and East Nusa Tenggara provinces. Sequencing of ribosomal DNA ITS2 gene fragments and two mitochondrial DNA gene markers,COIandcytb, enabled molecular identification of morphologically indistinguishable members of the complex. Findings allowed inference on the distribution of theAn.sundaicuss.l. present in Indonesia and further illustrate the phylogenetic relationships ofAn.epiroticuswithin the complex. A total of 370An.sundaicuss.l specimens were analysed for the ITS2 fragment. The ITS2 sequence alignment revealed two consistent species-specific point mutations, a T>C transition at base 479 and a G>T transversion at base 538 that differentiated five haplotypes: TG, CG, TT, CT, and TY. The TG haplotype matched publishedAn.epiroticus-indicative sequences from Thailand, Vietnam and peninsular Malaysia. The previously described insertion event (base 603) was observed in all identified specimens. Analysis of theCOIandcytbgenes revealed no consistent nucleotide variations that could definitively distinguishAn.epiroticusfrom other members in the Sundaicus Complex. The findings indicate and support the existence ofAn.epiroticusin North Sumatra and Bangka-Belitung archipelago. Further studies are recommended to determine the full distributional extent of the Sundaicuscomplex in Indonesia and investigate the role of these species in malaria transmission.

TI  - Spatial analysis of the distribution of <i>Ehrlichia chaffeensis</i>, causative agent of human monocytotropic ehrlichiosis, across a multi-state region
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Ehrlichia chaffeensis, which causes human monocytotrophic ehrlichiosis (HME), is an important emerging tick-borne pathogen in the southeastern and southcentral United States. The endemnicity probability of E. chaffeensis and, by implication, locations with risk for HME, was predicted by using two modeling methods. This is first large-scale study to use geospatial analyses to estimate the distribution of E. chaffeensis, and it was conducted using data from a prototypic surveillance system that used white-tailed deer as natural sentinels. Analyses included the E. chaffeensis serostatus for 563 counties from IS states. Both kriging and logistic regression models provided very reliable portrayals of E. chaffeensis occurrence and predicted that E. chaffeensis distribution had good concordance with human case data. The integration of a deer surveillance system with geospatial analyses was useful in developing HME risk maps that will be useful for identifying high-risk areas for public health interventions such as prevention and control efforts.

TI  - Transmission of <i>Onchocerca volvulus</i> by <i>Simulium neavei</i> in Mount Elgon Focus of Eastern Uganda Has Been Interrupted
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - The study determined that Simulium neavei-transmitted onchocerciasis in Mount Elgon onchocerciasis focus had been interrupted. Annual mass treatment with ivermectin changed to two times per year along with vector elimination in 2007. Then, baseline microfilaria (mf) prevalence data of 1994 in five sentinel communities were compared with follow-up data in 2005 and 2011. Blood spots from 3,051 children obtained in 2009 were analyzed for Onchocerca volvulus immunoglobulin G4 antibodies. Fresh water crab host captures and blackflies collected indicated their infestation with larval stages of S. neavei and presence or absence of the vector, respectively. Mf rates dropped from 62.2% to 0.5%, and 1 (0.03%) of 3,051 children was positive for O. volvulus antibodies. Crab infestation dropped from 41.9% in 2007 to 0%, and S. neavei biting reduced to zero. Both remained zero for the next 3 years, confirming interruption of onchocerciasis transmission, and interventions were halted.

TI  - Yeasts from phylloplane and their capability to produce indole-3-acetic acid
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB  - Yeasts were isolated from the phylloplane of various plant species collected from seven provinces in Thailand. A total of 114 yeast strains and 10 strains of a yeast-like fungus were obtained by enrichment isolation from 91 out of 97 leaf samples (93.8 %). On the basis of the D1/D2 domain of the large subunit rRNA gene sequence similarity, 98 strains were identified to be of 36 yeast species in 18 genera belonging to Ascomycota viz. Candida, Clavispora, Cyberlindnera, Debaryomyces, Hanseniaspora, Hyphopichia, Kazachstania, Kluyveromyces, Kodamaea, Lachancea, Metschnikowia, Meyrozyma, Pichia, Starmerella, Torulaspora and Wickerhamomyces, and to Basidiomycota viz. Sporidiobolus and Trichosporon. Three strains were found to represent two novels Candida species which were previously described as C. sirachaensis and C. sakaeoensis. Ten strains of yeast-like fungus were identified as Aureobasidium pullulans of the phylum Ascomycota. Ascomycetous yeast species accounted altogether for 98.0 % of the 98 strains. The prevalent species was Candida tropicalis with a low frequency of isolation (14.3 %). Diversity of yeasts other than ballistoconidium-forming yeast in phylloplane in a tropical country in Asia has been reported for the first time. All strains obtained were accessed for the capability to produce IAA and result revealed that 39 strains in 20 species, one strain each of an undescribed and a novel species, and two unidentified strains showed the capability of producing IAA when cultivated in yeast extract peptone dextrose broth supplemented with 0.1 % l-tryptophan. All five strains of Candida maltosa produced relatively high concentrations of IAA.

TI  - A high-resolution, integrated system for rice yield forecasting at district level
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB  - To meet the growing demands from public and private stakeholders for early yield estimates, a high-resolution (2 km x 2 km) rice yield forecasting system based on the integration of the WARM model and remote sensing (RS) technologies was developed. RS was used to identify rice-cropped area and to derive spatially distributed sowing dates, and for the dynamic assimilation of RS-derived leaf area index (LAI) data within the crop model. The system-tested for the main European rice production districts in Italy, Greece, and Spain-performed satisfactorily; > 66% of the inter-annual yield variability was explained in six out of eight combinations of ecotype x district, with a maximum of 89% of the variability explained for the 'Tropical Japonica' cultivars in the Vercelli district (Italy). In seven out of eight cases, the assimilation of RS-derived LAI improved the forecasting capability, with minor differences due to the assimilation technology used (updating or recalibration). In particular, RS data reduced uncertainty by capturing factors that were not properly reproduced by the simulation model (given the uncertainty due to large-area simulations). The system, which is an extension of the one used for rice within the EC-JRC-MARS forecasting system, was used pre-operationally in 2015 and 2016 to provide early yield estimates to private companies and institutional stakeholders within the EU-FP7 ERMES project.

TI  - Portable infrared imaging for longitudinal limb volume monitoring in patients with lymphatic filariasis
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   The Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (LF) emphasizes hygiene, exercise, and other measures to reduce morbidity and disability related to LF. We recently reported that a portable, three-dimensional, infrared imaging system (3DIS) provides accurate limb volume measurements in patients with filarial lymphedema. To assess the practical utility of repeated 3DIS measurements for longitudinal lymphedema management, we examined intraday and day-to-day leg volume changes in adults with filarial lymphedema in southern Sri Lanka.
   Methodology and principal findings
   We assessed 41 participants with lower extremity lymphedema (stages 1-6) in their homes in the mornings (6:00-9:00 AM) and afternoons (2:00-6:00 PM) of three days within one calendar week. Two examiners performed replicate 3DIS volume measurements at each visit. Median coefficient of variation among replicate volume measurements was 1.7% (IQR 1.1% - 2.3%) for left legs and 2.2% (IQR 1.6% - 2.8%) for right legs. Median intraday volume increase was 3.0%. Range among daily volume measurements tended to be lower for afternoon measurements (median 2.25%, IQR 1.4%- 5.4%) than for morning measurements (median 3.0%, IQR 1.4% - 8.4%).
   Conclusions and significance
   Limb volume measurements by 3DIS are accurate and reproducible, and this technique is feasible for use in patients' homes. We have developed practical suggestions for optimal outcomes with 3DIS. Duplicate measurements should be performed and repeat assessments should be done at approximately the same time of day to minimize bias. Duplicate measures that vary by more than 8% should prompt review of scanning technique with a repeat measurement. With proper training and attention to technique, 3DIS can be a valuable tool for healthcare workers who work with lymphedema patients.

TI  - Elephant frugivory and wild boar seed predation of <i>Irvingia malayana</i>, a large-fruited tree, in a rainforest of Peninsular Malaysia
T2  - RAFFLES BULLETIN OF ZOOLOGY
AB  - Irvingia malayana is a large-fruited and large-seeded tree species of Southeast Asia. As a large-fruited tree, it interacts with large mammal consumers, which either disperse or consume its seeds. In this preliminary study, we describe functional differences between Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) and wild boars (Sus scrofa) in their interactions with the fruits of I. malayana in a rainforest in northern Peninsular Malaysia. We baited one camera trap under each of five fruiting I. malayana trees for a total of 86 camera trap nights and recorded a total of 145 independent visits from 12 vertebrate species. We recorded only two (1.4% of 145) visits by elephants, but they were the only animals to swallow I. malayana seeds (1.9% of 312 focal seeds). Wild boars were frequently recorded (29.7% of the animal visits), and they often acted as seed predators (consuming 24.4% of the 312 focal seeds). Besides these functional differences, an interesting temporal resource differentiation between the two species was also observed. Elephants consumed fresh fruits of one or two days old, while wild boars consumed fruits older than five days, probably when seeds could be accessed more efficiently. No animal species other than elephants was recorded to swallow the fruits of I. malayana, suggesting that elephants may be important dispersal vectors for this tree species in the tropical rainforest of Malaysia.

TI  - Life History Traits and Predatory Performance of <i>Belostoma anurum</i> (Hemiptera: Belostomatidae), a Biological Control Agent of Disease Vector Mosquitoes
T2  - NEOTROPICAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - Understanding the life cycle and dietary requirements of laboratory-reared insects is critical for optimizing resources (including time) and can provide more reliable ecological basis for using such biological control agents in realistic programs. Here, we evaluated the complete development and the predatory abilities of Belostoma anurum (Herrich-Schaffer, 1848) (Hemiptera: Belostomatidae), an aquatic predator widely distributed in Neotropical region, when reared at different diets. We firstly investigated the predatory performance of B. anurum nymphs upon mosquito larvae (i.e., larvae of Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus, 1758) or Culex sp. (Diptera: Culicidae)) and, second, whether the immature diets (i.e., arthropod-based diet (mosquito larvae and adults of Notonectidae) or vertebrate (fish larvae)-based diet) affect the predatory behavior of B. anurum adults. The B. anurum egg-to-adult developmental time was 85.1 days in an arthropod-based diet. However, when a fish-based diet was offered after nymphs reached 3rd instar, we recorded up to 50% reductions on the B. anurum developmental time. Interestingly, B. anurum adults could live more than 1 year under laboratory conditions, independently of the immature diet regime. Furthermore, the fish diet-experienced B. anurum adults spent less time feeding on fish larvae when compared with adults that never experienced this type of diet. Predatory results revealed that 2nd instar B. anurum were more efficient to catch and consume larvae of A. aegypti than of Culex sp. Collectively, our findings show that B. anurum is long-lived aquatic predators, and demonstrate the impacts of dietary regime on the life history traits and predatory performance of these insects.

TI  - American cutaneous leishmaniasis in dogs from an endemic urban area in Cianorte municipality, Parana State, Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF VENOMOUS ANIMALS AND TOXINS INCLUDING TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - American cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL) was investigated in dogs from an urban endemic area in Cianorte, Parana state, Brazil. Of 169 studied dogs, none presented suspected ACL lesions. Eleven animals (6.6%) had anti-Leishmania braziliensis antibodies (titers >= 40) detected by the immunofluorescent antibody test (IFAT) while four (2.4%) showed L. braziliensis-complex DNA by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Although no associations were found between IFAT or PCR results and age, sex, origin, free-roaming animals or length of residence at the address, the majority of IFAT-or PCR-positive dogs were from the urban area of the city and were allowed to roam freely beyond their neighborhood. The presence of anti-Leishmania braziliensis antibodies and L. braziliensis-complex DNA in dogs from this urban area near a native-forest park indicates the importance of following up on these dogs to confirm the ACL diagnosis.

TI  - Temporal consistency in interactions among birds, ants, and plants in a neotropical savanna
T2  - OIKOS
AB  - Interactions among animals and plants are key to understanding seed dispersal, plant regeneration and plant community patterns. These interactions can be dynamic, with changes of species and functional roles across space and time. Despite fluctuations in species abundances and resources over time being the rule in natural communities, most studies approach plant-frugivore interactions as temporally static. We documented changes in bird and ant species in interactions with plants producing carbohydrate- (Miconia rubiginosa) or lipid-rich diaspores (Xylopia aromatica) comparing two fruiting seasons 15 years apart in a savanna in southeastern Brazil. We tested if abundance and body size of dispersal vectors (birds and ants) affected the frequency of interactions and the quantitative effectiveness of seed dispersal (QTC). Rich bird (26 species) and ant (18 genera) assemblages interacted with the diaspores. A core of bird and ant taxa was temporally consistent, and responsible for most seed removal across the two years for both plants. Temporal transience was more common for sporadic partners of interactions, and for species with similar functional roles. Abundance and body size of birds affected the interspecific contributions to QTC. Large-bodied birds dispersed large quantities of seeds of our relatively small-seeded plants, even if their visits were sporadic. For ants, variations in temperature and rainfall across time seems more important in driving variations in the contributions to QTC. The combined effect of birds and ants in the same system helps to stabilize the temporal fluctuations in the amount of seeds dispersed. However, ants alone are unlikely to replace the functional roles of vertebrate dispersers. Even though species in the assemblage change either their quantitative contribution to seed dispersal or their presence or absence in the interaction network, species persisting in interaction over time are the most important quantitative partners for plants.

TI  - Foliar pathogen and insect herbivore effects on two landslide tree species in Puerto Rico
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - To better understand pathogen/herbivore interactions and landslide regeneration, percent leaf area lost to disease and herbivory on two Puerto Rican trees over a 1-year period was sampled. Cecropia schreberiana saplings lost from 1 to 3% leaf area to pathogens and from 1 to 7% to herbivores. For Inga vera, both sapling and seedling losses to pathogens were minimal, but Inga herbivory losses reached 25% for saplings and 34% for seedlings. The most common fungi on Cecropia leaves were species in the genera Phoma and Phyllosticta, and on Inga leaves was Colletotrichum gloeosporioides. Percent survivorship after 1 year in the field varied among species and life-form (46% for Cecropia saplings, 15% for Inga saplings, 0% for Inga seedlings). There were no effects of pathogens or herbivores on survivorship or growth, but increased levels of herbivory did significantly correlate with total phenolics and condensed tannins in both Inga seedlings and saplings. For both seedlings and saplings of two trees on the neotropic island of Puerto Rico: (1) leaf herbivory was modest and leaf losses to pathogen disease were small; (2) these mechanisms did not affect survivorship or growth; (3) a neotropical tree (I. vera) displayed increased levels of secondary chemicals in its leaves, correlated with increased levels of insect herbivory.

TI  - Antimicrobial activity and partial chemical structure of acylpolyamines isolated from the venom of the spider <i>Acanthoscurria natalensis</i>
T2  - JOURNAL OF VENOMOUS ANIMALS AND TOXINS INCLUDING TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background: Acylpolyamines are one of the main non-peptide compounds present in spider venom and represent a promising alternative in the search for new molecules with antimicrobial action.
   Methods: The venom of Acanthoscurria natalensis spider was fractionated by reverse-phase liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and the antimicrobial activity of the fractions was tested using a liquid growth inhibition assay. The main antimicrobial fraction containing acylpolyamines (ApAn) was submitted to two additional chromatographic steps and analyzed by MALDI-TOF. Fractions of interest were accumulated for ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy and ESI-MS/MS analysis and for minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and hemolytic activity determination.
   Results: Five acylpolyamines were isolated from the venom with molecular masses between 614 Da and 756 Da, being named ApAn728, ApAn614a, ApAn614b, ApAn742 and ApAn756. The analysis of UV absorption profile of each ApAn and the fragmentation pattern obtained by ESI-MS/MS suggested the presence of a tyrosyl unit as chromophore and a terminal polyamine chain consistent with structural units PA43 or PA53. ApAn presented MIC between 128 mu M and 256 mu M against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, without causing hemolysis against mouse erythrocytes.
   Conclusion: The antimicrobial and non-hemolytic properties of the analyzed ApAn may be relevant for their application as possible therapeutic agents and the identification of an unconventional chromophore for spider acylpolyamines suggests an even greater chemical diversity.

TI  - Resistance of cervical adenocarcinoma cells (HeLa) to venom from the scorpion <i>Centruroides limpidus limpidus</i>
T2  - JOURNAL OF VENOMOUS ANIMALS AND TOXINS INCLUDING TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background: The venom of Centruroides limpidus limpidus (Cll) is a mixture of pharmacologically active principles. The most important of these are toxic proteins that interact both selectively and specifically with different cellular targets such as ion channels. Recently, anticancer properties of the venom from other scorpion species have been described. Studies in vitro have shown that scorpion venom induces cell death, inhibits proliferation and triggers the apoptotic pathway in different cancer cell lines. Herein, after treating human cervical adenocarcinoma (HeLa) cells with Cll crude venom, their cytotoxic activity and apoptosis induction were assessed.
   Results: Cll crude venom induced cell death in normal macrophages in a dose-dependent manner. However, through viability assays, HeLa cells showed high survival rates after exposure to Cll venom. Also, Cll venom did not induce apoptosis after performing ethidium bromide/acridine orange assays, nor was there any evidence of chromatin condensation or DNA fragmentation.
   Conclusions: Crude Cll venom exposure was not detrimental to HeLa cell cultures. This may be partially attributable to the absence of specific HeLa cell membrane targets for molecules present in the venom of Centruroides limpidus limpidus. Although these results might discourage additional studies exploring the potential of Cll venom to treat human papilloma cervical cancer, further research is required to explore positive effects of crude Cll venom on other cancer cell lines.

TI  - The safety and efficacy of amocarzine in African onchocerciasis and the influence of ivermectin on the clinical and parasitological response to treatment
T2  - ANNALS OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND PARASITOLOGY
AB  - One hundred men from a forest area of Ghana, without vector control or ivermectin distribution, were randomized to receive a single dose of ivermectin (150 mu g/kg body weight) on day 1 followed by amocarzine (3 mg/kg twice daily after meals) on days 8, 9 and 10 (34 patients), the ivermectin alone (33 patients) or the amocarzine alone (33 patients). Detailed clinical and laboratory examinations were made before, during and after drug administration. On day 120, all palpable nodules were excised, fixed, sectioned, stained and examined by two blinded observers and the results compared with those for nodules from untreated controls.
   Mazzotti-type reactions, such as itching, rash, peripheral sensory phenomena and swellings, were more severe or frequent with amocarzine than ivermectin. Pretreatment with ivermectin markedly suppressed these reactions to amocarzine but did not affect other manifestations such as dizziness and gaze-evoked nystagmus. Ocular effects were minor in all groups.
   Ivermectin produced minor macrofilaricidal effects on the adult male worms, marked degeneration of intra-uterine embryos, and potent microfilaricidal effects and suppressed skin microfilariae. Amocarzine did not affect the male worms or the intra-uterine embryos, was a less potent microfilaricide and did not suppress skin microfilariae. The efficacy of ivermectin plus amocarzine was similar to that of ivermectin alone.
   The present results do not support the findings from the Americas and show that amocarzine has no role in the treatment of onchocerciasis in Africa.

TI  - Progress in Myrtaceae genetics and genomics: <i>Eucalyptus</i> as the pivotal genus
T2  - TREE GENETICS & GENOMES
AB  - The status of genomics and genetics research in the Myrtaceae, a large family of dicotyledonous woody plants, is reviewed with Eucalyptus as the focal genus. The family contains over 5,650 species in 130 to 150 genera, predominantly of neo-tropical and Southern Hemisphere distribution. Several genera are well known for their economic importance worldwide. Myrtaceae are typically diploids with small to intermediate genome size. Microsatellites have been developed for several genera while higher throughput marker systems such as diversity arrays technology and single nucleotide polymorphism are available for Eucalyptus. Molecular data have been fundamental to current perspectives on the phylogeny, phylogeography and taxonomy of the Myrtaceae, while numerous studies of genetic diversity have been carried out particularly as it relates to endangered, rare, fragmented, overharvested or economically important species. Large expressed sequence tag collections for species of Eucalyptus have recently become public to support the annotation of the Eucalyptus grandis genome. Transcriptomics in Eucalyptus has advanced by microarrays and next-generation sequencing focusing on wood development. Linkage maps for Eucalyptus display high synteny across species and have been extensively used to map quantitative trait loci for a number of traits including growth, wood quality, disease and insect resistance. Candidate gene-based association genetics have successfully found marker-trait associations for wood and fiber traits. Genomic selection experiments have demonstrated clear potential to improve the efficiency of breeding programs while freeze-tolerant transgenic Eucalyptus trials have recently been initiated. The recently released E. grandis genome, sequenced to an average coverage of 8x, will open up exceptional opportunities to advance Myrtaceae genetics and genomics research.

TI  - Primary health care situations in remote rural villages of the Savannakhet province, Lao People's Democratic Republic
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HEALTH
AB  - Background To improve the health of the rural population in the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), the government has emphasized a primary health care approach in the Health Sector Reform Strategy by 2025. The objective of the present study was to describe the health-related situations of remote rural villages of the Lao PDR to inform strategies for promoting primary health care in such villages. Methods Ten remote rural villages were purposively selected from the catchment areas of two health centers in the Xepon district, Savannakhet province. The surveyors collected data by conducting a questionnaire-based interview with village health volunteers and by observing the village environment in 2018. The survey focused on village situations on the eight elements of primary health care (health education; food supply and nutrition; safe water and basic sanitation; maternal and child health care; immunization; prevention and control of locally endemic diseases; treatment of common diseases and injuries; and provision of essential drug). Results The common health problems were diarrhea, followed by malaria, and cough. The identified possible risk factors for the health problems were not washing hands with soap, open defecation, not boiling drinking water, not exclusively breastfeeding, presence of animal feces on the village ground, absence of garbage management system, not using a bed net when sleeping in the forest, and exposure to indoor cooking and tobacco smoke. In many villages, villagers were not able to eat enough food and did not eat protein-rich food and vegetables daily. Conclusions Potential risk factors for the reported common health problems were often prevalent in the study villages. Villagers can address most of these risk factors, as interventions to address such risk factors do not require a large financial input. There is a need for intersectoral actions between the health and other sectors to address food shortages and indoor air pollution due to indoor cooking using biomass fuel.

TI  - New records of Sabethini (Diptera: Culicidae) from Colombia
T2  - BIODIVERSITY DATA JOURNAL
AB  - Background In the Neotropical Region, the mosquitoes, grouped in the tribe Sabethini (Arthropoda, Insecta, Diptera: Culicidae) are considered of medical importance by the role that some species may have in arbovirus transmission; also, because they are good bioindicators. More than 400 species are currently recognised and are mainly associated with forest areas. The tribe Sabethini is poorly studied and the information about diversity and distribution for species relating to it is scarce. In Colombia, 54 species of the tribe are known; however, several geographical areas have not been included in the studies for this group and data for recent field collections are not available; therefore, the records are outdated. New information This study presents the species list of the Sabethini tribe in Colombia, based on a review of previous publications and recent unpublished data. The list includes 68 species of nine genera and 16 subgenera. The genus Wyeomyia has the highest species number (39), followed by Sabethes (14). A total of 29 new records are registered and actualized information related to the local distribution in some Departments is presented, including geographic coordinates. In this paper, the distribution records of Sabethini for Colombia are updated, revealing the high diversity of this group in the country and providing some useful information for species that may need surveillance or control.

TI  - MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION OF AMERICAN CUTANEOUS LEISHMANIASIS IN THE TRI-BORDER AREA OF ASSIS BRASIL, ACRE STATE, BRAZIL
T2  - REVISTA DO INSTITUTO DE MEDICINA TROPICAL DE SAO PAULO
AB  - In this study, Leishmania species were identified by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). The epidemiology of patients suspected of having American Cutaneous Leishmaniasis in the municipality of Assis Brasil, Acre State, located in the Brazil/Peru/Bolivia tri-border was also investigated. By PCR, the DNA of Leishmania was detected in 100% of the cases (37 samples) and a PCR-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) of the hsp 70 gene identified the species in 32 samples: Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis (65.6%), L. (V.) shawi (28.1%), L. (V.) guyanensis (3.1%) and mixed infection L. (V.) guyanensis and L. (Leishmania) amazonensis (3.1%). This is the first report of L. (V.) shawi and L. (L.) amazonensis in Acre. The two predominant species were found in patients living in urban and rural areas. Most cases were found in males living in rural areas for at least three years and involved in rural work. This suggests, in most cases, a possible transmission of the disease from a rural/forest source, although some patients had not engaged in activities associated with permanence in forestall areas, which indicate a possible sandflies adaptation to the periurban setting.

TI  - Direct long-distance dispersal shapes a New World amphitropical disjunction in the dispersal-limited dung moss <i>Tetraplodon</i> (Bryopsida: Splachnaceae)
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY
AB  - AimMany intercontinental disjunctions, especially among spore-producing plants, are shaped by long-distance dispersal (LDD) via wind currents. Amphitropical disjunctions are most commonly explained through LDD, but other vectors and dispersal scenarios must also be considered. To interpret the New World amphitropical disjunction in the dung-moss genus Tetraplodon, we compared stepwise migration along the Andes, direct LDD and ancient vicariance.
   LocationGlobal, specifically high-latitude and high-elevation localities, with a focus on the New World.
   MethodsPhylogenetic relationships were inferred from four loci sampled from 124 populations representing the global range of Tetraplodon, and analysed using maximum-likelihood and Bayesian optimality criteria, with divergence dates estimated in beast.
   ResultsThe monophyletic T.mnioides complex diversified between the early Miocene and early-to-mid Pliocene into three well-supported clades, each with a unique geographical distribution: Laurasian, primarily high-elevation tropical, and amphitropical. Populations from southernmost South American were reconstructed as a monophyletic lineage that diverged from high-latitude Northern Hemisphere populations around 8.63Ma [95% highest posterior density (HPD) 3.07-10.11Ma].
   Main conclusionsDirect LDD has resulted in the American amphitropical disjunction in Tetraplodon. A lack of modern or historical wind connectivity between polar regions and the poor resistance of Tetraplodon spores to the conditions associated with wind-dispersal suggest that bird-mediated LDD provides the best explanation for the establishment of amphitropicality.

TI  - ECOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF AMERICAN CUTANEOUS LEISHMANIASIS .9. PREVALENCE INCIDENCE OF THE HUMAN INFECTION IN PEDRO-DE-TOLEDO AND MIRACATU MUNICIPALITIES, SAO-PAULO, BRAZIL
T2  - REVISTA DO INSTITUTO DE MEDICINA TROPICAL DE SAO PAULO
AB  - The epidemiologic study was conducted during the 1973-1984 period. The clinical prospective exam and Montenegro skin, immunoflurescent and passive hemagglutination tests have been carried out in three small localities between Pedro de Toledo e Miracatu municipalities, Sao Paulo, Brazil. The retrospective study of human-cases involved 108 and 65 cases registered in Pedro de Toledo e Miracatu, respectively. In the three communities studied, 273 people were examinated clinically and serologically. Twenty two individuals had had signals of cutaneous leishmaniasis; 10.2 and 12.8% were seropositive to IF and HA. Leishmanin skin testing of a sample of 154 people residents in Pedra do Largo showed prevalence of Leishmania infection in 25.5%. This result involved individual of all ages and sex. However, 5.8% of them were from 0 to 9 years old. The data confirmed that active parasite transmission didn't occur every year, either. The human infection seems not to depend on man contact with a forest. The incidence relatively low suggests low endemic area for cutaneous leishmaniasis and an explosive behavior of the cases. The temporal distribution of disease was irregular and the epidemiological pattern seen was different from the other endemic area of South America.

TI  - Towards an Effective, Rational and Sustainable Approach for the Control of Cattle Ticks in the Neotropics
T2  - VACCINES
AB  - Ticks and transmitted pathogens constitute a major burden for cattle industry in the Neotropics. To address this limitation, the Spanish Ibero-American Program of Science and Technology in Development office (CYTED) supported from 2018 a network of scientists named "LaGar" (CYTED code 118RT0542) aimed at optimizing the control strategies of cattle ticks in the neotropical region. As part of network activities, a meeting and course were organized on 4-8 November 2019 in Queretaro, Mexico to address the objective of developing the infrastructure necessary for an effective, sustainable (i.e., combination of efficacious acaricides with anti-tick vaccines) and rational (i.e., considering tick ecology, seasonal dynamics and cattle-wildlife interactions) control of cattle tick infestations and transmitted pathogens. The course was focused on scientists, students, cattle holders and producers and pharmaceutical/industry representatives. In this way the course addressed the different views presented by participants with the conclusion of producing a research-driven combination of different interventions for the control of tick tick-borne diseases.

TI  - Comparative Transcriptome Analysis Unravels the Response Mechanisms of <i>Fusarium oxysporum</i> f.sp. <i>cubense</i> to a Biocontrol Agent, <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> Gxun-2
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
AB  - Banana Fusarium wilt, which is caused by Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. cubense Tropical Race 4 (FOC TR4), is one of the most serious fungal diseases in the banana-producing regions in east Asia. Pseudomonas aeruginosa Gxun-2 could significantly inhibit the growth of FOC TR4. Strain Gxun-2 strongly inhibited the mycelial growth of FOC TR4 on dual culture plates and caused hyphal wrinkles, ruptures, and deformities on in vitro cultures. Banana seedlings under pot experiment treatment with Gxun-2 in a greenhouse resulted in an 84.21% reduction in the disease. Comparative transcriptome analysis was applied to reveal the response and resistance of FOC TR4 to Gxun-2 stress. The RNA-seq analysis of FOC TR4 during dual-culture with P. aeruginosa Gxun-2 revealed 3075 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) compared with the control. Among the genes, 1158 genes were up-regulated, and 1917 genes were down-regulated. Further analysis of gene function and the pathway of DEGs revealed that genes related to the cell membrane, cell wall formation, peroxidase, ABC transporter, and autophagy were up-regulated, while down-regulated DEGs were enriched in the sphingolipid metabolism and chitinase. These results indicated that FOC TR4 upregulates a large number of genes in order to maintain cell functions. The results of qRT-PCR conducted on a subset of 13 genes were consistent with the results of RNA-seq data. Thus, this study serves as a valuable resource regarding the mechanisms of fungal pathogen resistance to biocontrol agents.

TI  - Natural history and ecological effects on the establishment and fate of Florida carpenter ant cadavers infected by the parasitic manipulator <i>Ophiocordyceps camponoti</i>-<i>floridani</i>
T2  - FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY
AB  - Ophiocordyceps fungi manipulate the behaviour of their ant hosts to produce a summit disease phenotype, thereby establishing infected ant cadavers onto vegetation at elevated positions suitable for fungal growth and transmission. Multiple environmental and ecological factors have been proposed to shape the timing, positioning and outcome of these manipulations. We conducted a long-term field study of Ophiocordyceps camponoti-floridani infections of Camponotus floridanus ants-the Florida zombie ants. We propose and refine hypotheses on the factors that shape infection outcomes by tracking the occurrence of and fungal growth from hundreds of ant cadavers. We modelled and report these data in relation to weather, light, vegetation and attack by hyperparasites. We investigated environmental factors that could affect the occurrence and location of newly manipulated ant cadavers. New cadaver occurrence was preferentially biased towards epiphytic Tillandsia bromeliads, canopy openness and summer weather conditions (an interactive effect of temperature, humidity and precipitation). Furthermore, we suggest that incident light at the individual cadaver level reflects microhabitat choice by manipulated ants or selective pressure on cadaver maintenance for conditions that improve fungal survival. We also asked which environmental conditions affect fungal fitness. Continued fungal development of reproductive structures and putative transmission increased with moist weather conditions (interaction of humidity and precipitation) and canopy openness, while being reduced by hyperparasitic mycoparasite infections. Moreover, under the most open canopy conditions, we found an atypical Ophiocordyceps growth morphology that could represent a plastic response to conditions influenced by high light levels. Taken together, we explore general trends and the effects of various ecological conditions on host and parasite disease outcomes in the Florida zombie ant system. These insights from the field can be used to inform experimental laboratory setups that directly test the effects of biotic and abiotic factors on fungus-ant interactions or aim to uncover underlying molecular mechanisms.

TI  - Phlebotomine sandflies (Diptera: Psychodidae) in Sao Vicente Ferrer, a sympatric area to cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis in the State of Pernambuco, Brazil
T2  - REVISTA DA SOCIEDADE BRASILEIRA DE MEDICINA TROPICAL
AB  - Introduction: In the last decades, a considerable geographic expansion of the leishmaniases in all regions of Brazil has been observed. The present study was carried out to identify the composition of the phlebotomine sandfly fauna and verify the seasonal variation of the main species after environmental changes occurred in Sao Vicente Ferrer Municipality, State of Pernambuco, Brazil. Methods: Captures were carried out during four consecutive nights of each month using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention light traps from September 2009 to September 2010. The correlation between the number of phlebotomine sandflies captured and climatic factors (temperature and rainfall) was evaluated. Results: A total of 13,872 specimens belonging to 20 species were captured, of which, 6,247 (45%) were females, and 7,625 (55%) were males. Lutzomyia migonei was the most abundant species with 9,964 (71.8%) specimens, being predominant in the intradomicile and peridomicile areas with 108 (86.4%) and 9,746 (97%), respectively. In the forest remnants, Lutzomyia complexa 2,395 (65%) and Lutzomyia sordellii 770 (20.8%) predominated. The correlation analysis between the total number of sandflies captured and climatic factors did not show a significant influence on population density. Conclusions: The high abundance of Lutzomyia migonei and Lutzomyia complexa indicates the possibility of new cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL).

T2  - TICKS AND TICK-BORNE DISEASES
AB  - The genus Amblyomma is the most diverse and relevant among the Neotropical ticks. In Panama, this genus contains 19 species, including Amblyomma ovate. There is a lack of knowledge of the ecology of A. ovate in Panama, and thus the aim of this work is to report on its geographical distribution and its spectrum of vertebrate hosts. We reviewed data of ticks collected in different areas of Panama from 2007 to 2012 and found parasitism of A. ovate in 625 vertebrates, corresponding to 21 species (2 species of birds and 19 mammal species). A. ovate is present in different environments of Panama, from lowlands to places with 800 m altitude, including rural towns, disturbed forests, and wilderness areas. (C) 2012 Elsevier GmbH.

TI  - Lyme disease in New York State: Spatial pattern at a regional scale
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Lyme disease occurs commonly in New York State, but its geographic distribution is heterogeneous. Over each of nine consecutive years, incidence rates from 57 New York State counties were subjected to spatial autocorrelation analysis. Although the epidemic advanced during the study period, the analyses reveal a consistent pattern of spatial dependence. The correlation distance, the distance over which incidence rates covary positively, remained near 120 km over the nine years. A local spatial analysis around Westchester County, a major disease focus, indicated that the global correlation distance matched the extent of the most intense local clustering; statistically weaker clustering extended to 200 km from Westchester. Analyzing the spatial character of the epidemic may reveal the epizootic processes underlying patterns in human infection, and may help identify a spatial scale for regional control of disease.

TI  - Molluscicidal activity and physiological toxicity of quaternary benzo[c]phenanthridine alkaloids (QBAs) from <i>Macleaya cordata</i> fruits on <i>Oncomelania hupensis</i>
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Schistosomiasis is a serious worldwide parasitic disease. One of the best ways to control schistosomiasis is to control the population of Oncomelania hupensis snails. We sought to identify a high-efficiency biogenic molluscicide against Oncomelania with low toxicity, to avoid chemical molluscicide contamination and toxicity in aquatic organisms. We extracted quaternary benzo[c]phenanthridine alkaloids (QBAs) from Macleaya cordata fruits. Molluscicidal activity of the QBAs against Oncomelania was determined using bioassay. Our results showed that the extracted QBAs had a strong molluscicidal effect. In treatment of O. hupensis with QBAs for 48 h and 72 h, the lethal concentration (LC50) was 2.89 mg/L and 1.29 mg/L, respectively. The molluscicidal activity of QBAs was close to that of niclosamide (ethanolamine salt), indicating that QBAs have potential development value as novel biogenic molluscicides. We also analyzed physiological toxicity mechanisms by examining the activity of several important detoxification enzymes. We measured the effect of the extracted QBAs on the activities of glutathione S-transferase (GST), carboxylesterase (CarE), acid phosphatase (ACP), and alkaline phosphatase (AKP) in the liver of O. hupensis. We found that the effects of QBAs on detoxification metabolism in O. hupensis were time and concentration dependent. The activities of GST, CarE, AKP, and ACP in the liver of snails increased significantly in the early stage of treatment (24 h), but decreased sharply in later stages (120 h), compared with these activities in controls. GST, CarE, AKP, and ACP activity in the liver of snails treated with LC50 QBAs for 120 h decreased by 62.3%, 78.1%, 59.2%, and 68.6%, respectively. Our results indicate that these enzymes were seriously inhibited by the extracted QBAs and the detoxification and metabolic functions of the liver gradually weakened, leading to poisoning, which could be the main cause of death in O. hupensis snails.

TI  - Identification and characterization of diverse groups of endogenous retroviruses in felids
T2  - RETROVIROLOGY
AB  - Background: Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are genetic elements with a retroviral origin that are integrated into vertebrate genomes. In felids (Mammalia, Carnivora, Felidae), ERVs have been described mostly in the domestic cat, and only rarely in wild species. To gain insight into the origins and evolutionary dynamics of endogenous retroviruses in felids, we have identified and characterized partial pro/pol ERV sequences from eight Neotropical wild cat species, belonging to three distinct lineages of Felidae. We also compared them with publicly available genomic sequences of Felis catus and Panthera tigris, as well as with representatives of other vertebrate groups, and performed phylogenetic and molecular dating analyses to investigate the pattern and timing of diversification of these retroviral elements.
   Results: We identified a high diversity of ERVs in the sampled felids, with a predominance of Gammaretrovirus-related sequences, including class I ERVs. Our data indicate that the identified ERVs arose from at least eleven horizontal interordinal transmissions from other mammals. Furthermore, we estimated that the majority of the Gamma-like integrations took place during the diversification of modern felids. Finally, our phylogenetic analyses indicate the presence of a genetically divergent group of sequences whose position in our phylogenetic tree was difficult to establish confidently relative to known retroviruses, and another lineage identified as ERVs belonging to class II.
   Conclusions: Retroviruses have circulated in felids along with their evolution. The majority of the deep clades of ERVs exist since the primary divergence of felids' base and cluster with retroviruses of divergent mammalian lineages, suggesting horizontal interordinal transmission. Our findings highlight the importance of additional studies on the role of ERVs in the genome landscaping of other carnivore species.

TI  - Inflammatory lesions and brain tumors: is it possible to differentiate them based on texture features in magnetic resonance imaging?
T2  - JOURNAL OF VENOMOUS ANIMALS AND TOXINS INCLUDING TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background: Neuroimaging strategies are essential to locate, to elucidate the etiology, and to the follow up of brain disease patients. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides good cerebral soft-tissue contrast detection and diagnostic sensitivity. Inflammatory lesions and tumors are common brain diseases that may present a similar pattern of a cerebral ring enhancing lesion on MRI, and non-enhancing core (which may reflect cystic components or necrosis) leading to misdiagnosis. Texture analysis (TA) and machine learning approaches are computer-aided diagnostic tools that can be used to assist radiologists in such decisions.
   Methods: In this study, we combined texture features with machine learning (ML) methods aiming to differentiate brain tumors from inflammatory lesions in magnetic resonance imaging. Retrospective examination of 67 patients, with a pattern of a cerebral ring enhancing lesion, 30 with inflammatory, and 37 with tumoral lesions were selected. Three different MRI sequences and textural features were extracted using gray level co-occurrence matrix and gray level run length. All diagnoses were confirmed by histopathology, laboratorial analysis or MRI.
   Results: The features extracted were processed for the application of ML methods that performed the classification. T1-weighted images proved to be the best sequence for classification, in which the differentiation between inflammatory and tumoral lesions presented high accuracy (0.827), area under ROC curve (0.906), precision (0.837), and recall (0.912).
   Conclusion: The algorithm obtained textures capable of differentiating brain tumors from inflammatory lesions, on T1-weghted images without contrast medium using the Random Forest machine learning classifier.

TI  - Frugivorous birds, host selection and the mistletoe Psittacanthus schiedeanus, in central Veracruz, Mexico
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY
AB  - Frugivorous birds play an important role in parasitic mistletoe transmission among host species. The foraging behaviour and host selection of Psittacanthus schiedeanus mistletoe fruit-eating birds was studied in cloud forest remnants in Central Veracruz, Mexico. Cedar waxwings, Bombycilla cedrorum, gray silky-flycatchers, Ptilogonys cinereus, and social flycatchers, Myiozetetes similis, eating ripe whole mistletoe fruits and defecating or regurgitating the seeds were observed. That variation in host species selection by frugivorous birds had a direct effect on mistletoe dispersion was hypothesized. To test whether mistletoe host species are visited in proportion to their abundance (total number of trees), or infested-tree abundance (total number of infested trees), or abundance of mistletoes (total number of individual mistletoe plants in each host species), the number of trees, infested trees and individual mistletoe plants were recorded. Tree abundance, infested-tree abundance and mistletoe abundance were different among host species. Frequency of birds' visits to host species varied depending on the tree, infested-tree, or mistletoe abundance. Liquidambar styraciflua was the most abundant host species with the highest number of infested trees and individual mistletoe plants, but Persea americana and Crataegus mexicana host species had the highest number of individual mistletoe plants in each tree. Our data suggest that L. syraciflua was the most selected host species by the three frugivorous birds. Host selection by birds is one behavioural factor in explaining differences in prevalence among host species, and variation in infection levels among individuals of one host species.

TI  - High-density genetic linkage maps with over 2,400 sequence-anchored DArT markers for genetic dissection in an F2 pseudo-backcross of Eucalyptus grandis x E. urophylla
T2  - TREE GENETICS & GENOMES
AB  - Traits that differentiate cross-fertile plant species can be dissected by genetic linkage analysis in interspecific hybrids. Such studies have been greatly facilitated in Eucalyptus tree species by the recent development of Diversity Arrays Technology (DArT) markers. DArT is an affordable, high-throughput marker technology for the construction of high-density genetic linkage maps. Eucalyptus grandis and Eucalyptus urophylla are commonly used to produce fast-growing, disease tolerant hybrids for clonal eucalypt plantations in tropical and subtropical regions. We analysed 7,680 DArT markers in an F2 pseudo-backcross mapping pedigree based on an F1 hybrid clone of E. grandis and E. urophylla. A total of 2,440 markers (31.7%) were polymorphic and could be placed in linkage maps of the F1 hybrid and two pure-species backcross parents. An integrated genetic linkage map was constructed for the pedigree resulting in 11 linkage groups (n = 11) with 2,290 high-confidence (LOD a parts per thousand yenaEuro parts per thousand 3.0) markers and a total map length of 1,107.6 cM. DNA sequence analysis of the mapped DArT marker fragments revealed that 43% were located in protein coding regions and 90% could be placed in the recently completed draft genome assembly of E. grandis. Together with the anchored genomic sequence information, this linkage map will allow detailed genetic dissection of quantitative traits and hybrid fitness characters segregating in the F2 progeny and will facilitate the development of markers for molecular breeding in Eucalyptus.

TI  - Coral and macroalgal exudates vary in neutral sugar composition and differentially enrich reef bacterioplankton lineages
T2  - ISME JOURNAL
AB  - Increasing algal cover on tropical reefs worldwide may be maintained through feedbacks whereby algae outcompete coral by altering microbial activity. We hypothesized that algae and coral release compositionally distinct exudates that differentially alter bacterioplankton growth and community structure. We collected exudates from the dominant hermatypic coral holobiont Porites spp. and three dominant macroalgae (one each Ochrophyta, Rhodophyta and Chlorophyta) from reefs of Mo'orea, French Polynesia. We characterized exudates by measuring dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and fractional dissolved combined neutral sugars (DCNSs) and subsequently tracked bacterioplankton responses to each exudate over 48 h, assessing cellular growth, DOC/DCNS utilization and changes in taxonomic composition (via 16S rRNA amplicon pyrosequencing). Fleshy macroalgal exudates were enriched in the DCNS components fucose (Ochrophyta) and galactose (Rhodophyta); coral and calcareous algal exudates were enriched in total DCNS but in the same component proportions as ambient seawater. Rates of bacterioplankton growth and DOC utilization were significantly higher in algal exudate treatments than in coral exudate and control incubations with each community selectively removing different DCNS components. Coral exudates engendered the smallest shift in overall bacterioplankton community structure, maintained high diversity and enriched taxa from Alphaproteobacteria lineages containing cultured representatives with relatively few virulence factors (VFs) (Hyphomonadaceae and Erythrobacteraceae). In contrast, macroalgal exudates selected for less diverse communities heavily enriched in copiotrophic Gammaproteobacteria lineages containing cultured pathogens with increased VFs (Vibrionaceae and Pseudoalteromonadaceae). Our results demonstrate that algal exudates are enriched in DCNS components, foster rapid growth of bacterioplankton and select for bacterial populations with more potential VFs than coral exudates.

TI  - Fungal diversity in peatlands and its contribution to carbon cycling
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - Peatlands are major carbon sinks globally, but it is still unclear what drives their shift from functioning as carbon sink to a source. Fungi rely on soil carbon inputs and play an active role in carbon mobilization and stabilization. Future climate change scenarios predict increases in temperature and lower water tables, which may lead to functional shifts in fungal communities growing in peatlands. Despite their abundance, the impact of fungi on carbon cycling in peatlands is still poorly understood. Therefore, it is crucial to study the dynamics and distribution of fungal communities in pristine peatlands in order to predict the potential changes in peatland ecosystems more accurately. Here, we review the current knowledge about fungal communities in peatlands, including the influence of peatland type, abiotic factors, and temporal and spatial dynamics on fungal diversity. Our overview shows that fungal diversity in peatlands of certain regions such as tropical areas is severely understudied. Furthermore, we examine the ecological roles and the relative contribution to carbon cycling of functional guilds of fungi in peatlands, showing that saprotrophs are the key guild in organic matter decomposition, and ericoid- and ectomycorrhizal fungi have the ability to act as decomposers and vectors of plant carbon input to soil. We suggest that the application of a combination of methodological approaches for taxonomic and functional characterisation of peatland fungal communities is needed to build better understanding about the diversity-functioning relationships in peatland ecosystems. Overall, this review shows that fungi must be considered as important drivers of mechanistic processes underlying biodiversity, plant nutrient uptake and carbon losses in peatlands.

TI  - Tetravalent dengue DNA vaccine is not immunogenic when delivered by retrograde infusion into salivary glands
T2  - TROPICAL DISEASES TRAVEL MEDICINE AND VACCINES
AB  - Introduction and background A tetravalent DNA vaccine for Dengue virus is under development but has not yet achieved optimal immunogenicity. Salivary glands vaccination has been reported efficacious in rodents and dogs. We report on a pilot study testing the salivary gland as a platform for a Dengue DNA vaccine in a non-human primate model. Materials and methods Four cynomolgus macaques were used in this study. Each macaque was pre-medicated with atropine and sedated with ketamine. Stensen's duct papilla was cannulated with a P10 polyethylene tube, linked to a 500ul syringe. On the first two infusions, all macaques were infused with 300ul of TVDV mixed with 2 mg of zinc. For the 3rd infusion, to increase transfection into salivary tissue, two animals received 100uL TVDV mixed with 400uL polyethylenimine 1 mu g/ml (PEI) and the other two animals received 500uL TVDV with zinc. Antibody titers were assessed 4 weeks following the second and third infusion. Results and conclusions SGRI through Stensen's duct is a well-tolerated, simple and easy to reproduce procedure. TVDV infused into macaques salivary glands elicited a significantly weaker antibody response than with different delivery methods.

TI  - Interspecific variability of prevalence in blood parasites of adult passerine birds during the breeding season in Alaska
T2  - JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE DISEASES
AB  - Blood parasite prevalence based on microscopic examination of stained blood smears was determined in adults of 11 passerine bird species sampled during their breeding season (May and June 1997-98) in interior Alaska (USA). These species included primarily Nearctic migratory species such as the dark-eyed junco (Junco hyemalis) and neotropical migratory species such as the blackpoll warbler (Dendroica striata), alder flycatcher (Empidonax alnorum), Swainson's thrush (Catharus ustulatus), northern waterthrush (Seiurus noveboracensis), and bank swallow (Riparia riparia) as well as one long-distance palearctic migrant, the arctic warbler (Phylloscopus borealis). The more prevalent parasites were Leucocytozoon dubreuili (73% of the sampled turdinids), L. fringillinarum (42% of the sampled fringillids and parulids), and Trypanosoma avium (39% of the sampled hosts). Other parasites (H. fallisi: 18% of the sampled turdinids; Haemoproteus paruli: 14% of the sampled parulids; H, fringillae: 5% of the sampled fringillids; microfilariae: 14% of the sampled hosts) were observed less frequently. Plasmodium vaughani was found only in two yellow warblers (Dendroica petechia). Overall parasite prevalence varied between 0% in the alder flycatcher to >80% in Swainson's thrush, arctic warbler, and Townsend's warbler (Dendroica townsendi). Prevalence of various hematozoa also was bird species-dependent. No relationship was observed between prevalence and either foraging (aerial versus trees/shrubs) or nesting habits (ground versus arboreal) or general location of the wintering area of the different species examined. Prevalence also was unrelated to average dates of arrival on breeding grounds and, therefore, to potential duration of exposure to local insect vectors before capture. Differences in blood parasite prevalence among species breeding in a same region and in the same type of habitat may result from differences in host specificity such as immunological resistance to infection or blood meal preference by potential vectors and/or in behavioral adjustments/physiological traits that alter exposure to vectors.

TI  - <i>Callerya atropurpurea</i> suppresses inflammation <i>in vitro</i> and ameliorates gastric injury as well as septic shock <i>in vivo</i> via TLR4/MyD88-dependent cascade
T2  - PHYTOMEDICINE
AB  - Background: Callerya atropurpurea is a traditional plant in a tropical zone discovered to have anti-inflammatory functions.
   Purpose: we want to investigate the mechanism related to anti-inflammation of C. atropurpurea ethanol extract (Ca-EE) both in vitro and in vivo.
   Study design: Murine macrophage cells and mouse models for gastritis and septic shock were conducted to evaluate the abilities of Ca-EE in anti-inflammation.
   Methods: Ca-EE was tested by HPLC and LC-MS/MS. NO outcome was checked by Griess reagent test. Cell viabilities were evaluated using MTT assay. Inflammatory cytokines were determined via RT-PCR and ELISA. The mechanism of Ca-EE in anti-inflammation was investigated by luciferase reporter gene assay and immunoblot in transcription level and protein level respectively. Gastric injury and septic shock administrated with Ca-EE were studied by H&E, PCR, and immunoblot.
   Results: Ca-EE significantly decreased LPS-induced NO production, but hardly stimulated the expression of NO itself. It not only showed no cytotoxicity, but also protected cells from LPS damage. Moreover, Ca-EE decreased TLR4 expression, altered MyD88 recruitment and TRAF6, and suppressed the phospho-Src/PI3K/AKT. Ca-EE inhibited downstream signaling P38, JNK and NF-kappa B. Finally, Ca-EE alleviated HCl/EtOH-induced gastritis and LPS/poly (I:C)-induced septic shock through the previously mentioned signaling cascades.
   Conclusion: Ca-EE exhibited an integrated and promising mechanism against TLR4-related inflammation, which shows potential for treating gastritis, septic shock, and other inflammatory diseases.

TI  - Guarea kunthiana Bark Extract Enhances the Antimicrobial Activities of Human and Bovine Neutrophils
T2  - NATURAL PRODUCT COMMUNICATIONS
AB  - Guarea kunthiana is used in folk remedies for the treatment of several diseases including microbial infections. The mechanism behind this phenomenon still needs to be elucidated. Here, we investigated the effect of G. kunthiana bark extract on antimicrobial functions of human and bovine neutrophils as the first line of defense against infections. For this aim, neutrophils were isolated from either human or bovine blood and treated with G. kunthiana bark extract. The antimicrobial activity of the neutrophils against Staphylococcus (S.) aureus and Escherichia (E.) coli was tested in a bacterial survival assay and a fluorescence-based phagocytosis assay. Furthermore, the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) was visualized by immunofluorescence microscopy. We show that neutrophils treated with G. kunthiana extract distinctly increased phagocytosis of S. aureus or E. coli. Interestingly, we demonstrate that G. kunthiana bark extract induces the formation of NETs in both cell types. This effect was abolished when treating the cells with diphenyleniodonium chloride (DPI) pointing to a direct implication of the NADPH oxidase-dependent formation of reactive oxygen species in this process. In summary, our data strongly suggest that G. kunthiana bark extract boosts the antimicrobial activities of neutrophils as the first line of defense against invading pathogens.

TI  - Single-cell atlas of the first intra-mammalian developmental stage of the human parasite <i>Schistosoma mansoni</i>
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB  - Over 250 million people suffer from schistosomiasis, a tropical disease caused by parasitic flatworms known as schistosomes. Humans become infected by free-swimming, water-borne larvae, which penetrate the skin. The earliest intra-mammalian stage, called the schistosomulum, undergoes a series of developmental transitions. These changes are critical for the parasite to adapt to its new environment as it navigates through host tissues to reach its niche, where it will grow to reproductive maturity. Unravelling the mechanisms that drive intra-mammalian development requires knowledge of the spatial organisation and transcriptional dynamics of different cell types that comprise the schistomulum body. To fill these important knowledge gaps, we perform single-cell RNA sequencing on two-day old schistosomula of Schistosoma mansoni. We identify likely gene expression profiles for muscle, nervous system, tegument, oesophageal gland, parenchymal/primordial gut cells, and stem cells. In addition, we validate cell markers for all these clusters by in situ hybridisation in schistosomula and adult parasites. Taken together, this study provides a comprehensive cell-type atlas for the early intra-mammalian stage of this devastating metazoan parasite. Schistosomes undergo several develepmental stages during infection of humans. Here, the authors perform single-cell RNA sequencing on the earliest intra-mammalian stage of Schistosoma mansoni and generate a comprehensive cell-type atlas for this human parasite.

T2  - JOURNAL OF NATURAL HISTORY
AB  - A new species of Hapalotremus Simon, 1903 from northern Argentina is described and illustrated. Hapalotremus martinorum sp. nov. differs from all other congeners by the colour pattern of live specimens. Males differ in the male palpal bulb morphology, with thickened and less curved embolus having a blunt subapical keel and less-developed apical keel. Females differ in the shape of the spermathecae, with the lateral bases more pronounced than the superiors and the upper edge more rounded. Specimens were captured inhabiting short burrows or crevices under stones in high cloud forests. Hapalotremus cyclothorax (Mello-Leitao 1923) is a junior synonym of Homoeomma montanum (Mello-Leitao, 1923), Hapalotremus scintillans (Mello-Leitao 1929) is a junior synonym of Pachistopelma rufonigrum Pocock, 1901, Hapalotremus exilis (Mello-Leitao 1923) and Hapalotremus muticus (Mello-Leitao 1923) are considered species inquirenda.

TI  - Oxygen minimum zones harbour novel viral communities with low diversity
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) are oceanographic features that affect ocean productivity and biodiversity, and contribute to ocean nitrogen loss and greenhouse gas emissions. Here we describe the viral communities associated with the Eastern Tropical South Pacific (ETSP) OMZ off Iquique, Chile for the first time through abundance estimates and viral metagenomic analysis. The viral-to-microbial ratio (VMR) in the ETSP OMZ fluctuated in the oxycline and declined in the anoxic core to below one on several occasions. The number of viral genotypes (unique genomes as defined by sequence assembly) ranged from 2040 at the surface to 98 in the oxycline, which is the lowest viral diversity recorded to date in the ocean. Within the ETSP OMZ viromes, only 4.95% of genotypes were shared between surface and anoxic core viromes using reciprocal BLASTn sequence comparison. ETSP virome comparison with surface marine viromes (Sargasso Sea, Gulf of Mexico, Kingman Reef, Chesapeake Bay) revealed a dissimilarity of ETSP OMZ viruses to those from other oceanic regions. From the 1.4 million non-redundant DNA sequences sampled within the altered oxygen conditions of the ETSP OMZ, more than 97.8% were novel. Of the average 3.2% of sequences that showed similarity to the SEED non-redundant database, phage sequences dominated the surface viromes, eukaryotic virus sequences dominated the oxycline viromes, and phage sequences dominated the anoxic core viromes. The viral community of the ETSP OMZ was characterized by fluctuations in abundance, taxa and diversity across the oxygen gradient. The ecological significance of these changes was difficult to predict; however, it appears that the reduction in oxygen coincides with an increased shedding of eukaryotic viruses in the oxycline, and a shift to unique viral genotypes in the anoxic core.

T2  - TICKS AND TICK-BORNE DISEASES
AB  - We report on the presence of the ixodid tick Amblyomma helvolum on three species of reptiles from Timor-Leste. Among a total of 21 host specimens (lizards: 18 four-fingered skinks, Carlia sp. 'Meleotegi' and two forest skinks, Sphenomorphus sp. 'Meleotegi'; snake: one Coelognathus subradiatus) four were parasitized by ticks. Whereas nymphs were associated with the lizards, an adult male was retrieved from the snake. This report is the first of A. helvolum for Timor-Leste, the first for the skink genera Carlia and Sphenomorphus, and the first for C. subradiatus. We present a comprehensive table with updated taxonomy of known associations between A. helvolum and other vertebrates.

TI  - Effects of larvicide treatment on invertebrate communities of Guinean rivers, West Africa
T2  - HYDROBIOLOGIA
CP  - Conference on Science and the Sustainable Management of Shallow Tropical Waters
AB  - Biological and hydrological data collected from 1984 to 1998 in three Guinean rivers were analysed to evaluate adverse effects of biological and chemical larvicides applied for the control of blackfly Simulium damnosum, vector of the parasitic digenean worm Onchocerca volvulus. Although most of the variation in invertebrate populations were now-related, larvicide applications affect community structure reducing the abundance of the most sensible taxa. In spite of these results, in the long term the rarefaction of some invertebrate taxa (i.e. Tricorythidae) does not cause a significant reduction of total invertebrate densities because of the corresponding increase of other taxa (i.e. Hydropsychidae and Philopotamidae). The functional structure of the communities is also not affected.

TI  - Stochastic Quasi-Likelihood for Case-Control Point Pattern Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION
AB  - We propose a novel stochastic quasi-likelihood estimation procedure for case-control point processes. Quasi-likelihood for point processes depends on a certain optimal weight function and for the new method the weight function is stochastic since it depends on the control point pattern. The new procedure also provides a computationally efficient implementation of quasi-likelihood for univariate point processes in which case a synthetic control point process is simulated by the user. Under mild conditions, the proposed approach yields consistent and asymptotically normal parameter estimators. We further show that the estimators are optimal in the sense that the associated Godambe information is maximal within a wide class of estimating functions for case-control point processes. The effectiveness of the proposed method is further illustrated using extensive simulation studies and two data examples.

TI  - Identification of divergent Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis ecotypes derived from a geographically restricted area through whole genome analysis
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - \ Leishmania braziliensis, the main etiological agent of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) in Latin America, is characterized by major differences in basic biology in comparison with better-known Leishmania species. It is also associated with a high phenotypic and possibly genetic diversity that need to be more adequately defined. Here we used whole genome sequences to evaluate the genetic diversity of ten L. braziliensis isolates from a CL endemic area from Northeastern Brazil, previously classified by Multi Locus Enzyme Electrophoresis (MLEE) into ten distinct zymodemes. These sequences were first mapped using the L. braziliensis M2904 reference genome followed by identification of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs). A substantial level of diversity was observed when compared with the reference genome, with SNP counts ranging from similar to 95,000 to similar to 131,000 for the different isolates. When the genome data was used to infer relationship between isolates, those belonging to zymodemes Z72/Z75, recovered from forested environments, were found to cluster separately from the others, generally associated with more urban environments. Among the remaining isolates, those from zymodemes Z74/Z106 were also found to form a separate group. Phylogenetic analyses were also performed using Multi-Locus Sequence Analysis from genes coding for four metabolic enzymes used for MLEE as well as the gene sequence coding for the Hsp70 heat shock protein. All 10 isolates were firmly identified as L. braziliensis, including the zymodeme Z26 isolate previously classified as Leishmania shawi, with the clustering into three groups confirmed. Aneuploidy was also investigated but found in general restricted to chromosome 31, with a single isolate, from zymodeme Z27, characterized by extra copies for other chromosomes. Noteworthy, both Z72 and Z75 isolates are characterized by a much reduced heterozygosity. Our data is consistent with the existence of distinct evolutionary groups in the restricted area sampled and a substantial genetic diversity within L. braziliensis.
   Author summary Leishmania braziliensis is the main etiological agent of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) in Latin America. In the Pernambuco state, a highly endemic area for CL in Northeastern Brazil, ten zymodemes have been previously described, identified through the detection of variations in the mobility of selected enzymes on gel electrophoresis (MLEE). Here we used next-generation genome sequencing to reevaluate the genetic diversity and relatedness between isolates representing these zymodemes. The genetic analysis clustered these isolates into three distinct phylogenetic groups, with those circulating in forested environments more related to each other (Z72 and Z75) and separated from the other eight isolates from more urbanized environments, but nevertheless forming two further groups. All ten isolates were definitely identified as L. braziliensis, including one from zymodeme Z26, previously identified as L. shawi through MLEE. Chromosome copy number variation was observed in all isolates studied, but restricted mainly to chromosome 31, with a single isolate (from zymodeme Z27) showing more than two copies of other chromosomes. A low heterozygosity observed only for both Z72/Z75 isolates also confirm differences associated with them. Our findings confirm that MLEE, despite still being considered the gold standard for characterization of Leishmania spp., does not reflect relevant information on intra-specific variations. It also highlights the substantial diversity observed between L. braziliensis isolates.

TI  - Biodiversity assessment of Phlebotomine (Diptera: Psychodidae) in an environmental impacted area in Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil
T2  - REVISTA DO INSTITUTO DE MEDICINA TROPICAL DE SAO PAULO
AB  - From October 1994 to September 1996, in the municipality of Mangaratiba, Rio de Janeiro State, phlebotomines were captured on the walls of the houses by means of a manual suction tube and light traps, in the household, the peridomicile and in the forest. As it is an area undergoing a real expansion and an increment in the local tourism, with the purpose of assessing changes in the phlebotomine fauna caused by environmental changes in the region, new captures were made in the same location from October 2015 to September 2016, this time using only light traps. In the two phases of the study, a total of 6,681 phlebotomines were captured. The results indicated that Ny. intermedia and Mg. migonei are fully adapted to this anthropic environment, while Pi. fischeri was more abundant and eclectic, and was probably attracted to exercise hematophagy. Nyssomyia intermedia can be suggested as the main vector of the etiological agent of the American Tegumentary Leishmaniasis in the studied areas. Pintomyia fischeri can also transmit Leishmania braziliensis, both in the environment altered by human action, and in the wild environment. Phlebotomines were captured in greater numbers between 6 and 8 pm in the peridomicile and between 9 and 11 pm in the household. The highest densities of phlebotomines were recorded in December, January and February. Despite almost 20 years between the two studies in the municipality of Mangaratiba, there was no change in the profile of the phlebotomine fauna in general; however, there was a greater density of species of medical importance in areas that suffered environmental impacts.

TI  - PHENOLIC COMPOSITION AND IN VITRO ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITIES OF SMILAX CHINA ROOT
T2  - JOURNAL OF FOOD BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - In the present study, various solvent fractions were prepared from the root of Smilax china (Liliaceae), which was collected during the autumn, and their radical-scavenging activity and several antioxidant activities were evaluated. The ethyl acetate fractions exhibited the highest antioxidant activities in all assays. In addition, the ethyl acetate fraction had the highest amount of total phenolics (401.62 mg/g). High-performance liquid chromatography analyses showed that catechin and epicatechin were the predominant phenolic compounds in the ethyl acetate fraction. Consequently, our research presented that the ethyl acetate fraction has the strongest antioxidant activities, which are correlated with its high level of phenolics, particularly catechin and epicatechin. Therefore, these results suggest that the ethyl acetate fraction of S. china root possess excellent antioxidant activities, and thus it has a great potential as a source of natural antioxidant. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS Smilax china is commonly known as Ba Qia (or Jin Gang Teng) in China, while in Pakistan, it is locally called Bilri.Smilax has 350 species and is distributed widely in tropical and temperate regions throughout the world, especially in East Asia and North America. In traditional Chinese medicine, it is used for the treatment of several diseases, especially for the management of chronic pelvic inflammation, syphilis, acute bacillary dysentery and chronic nephritis. In Korea, S. china has been used as a traditional remedy for inflammatory diseases and ischuria. It has been well known that the rhizome of the genus Smilax has various pharmacological activities. As for S. china, several reports describe the antimicrobial, antimutagenic, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer and neuroprotective effect. According to our results, the high antioxidant properties of the root of S. china might be beneficial to the antioxidant protection system of the human body against oxidative damage.

TI  - Infection patterns of the chytrid fungus, <i>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</i>, on anuran assemblages in agro-ecosystems from Buenos Aires Province, Argentina
T2  - PHYLLOMEDUSA
AB  - The disease chytridiomycosis, caused by the pathogenic chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), is linked to extinctions and declines of amphibians. Additionally, in the context of amphibian decline, the habitat loss related to agricultural landscapes is likely the single most important human activity affecting lowland amphibian populations. To assess the impact of anthropogenic land use on anuran response to Bd, infection patterns in several ponds from cultivated (CA) and uncultivated areas (UCA) were studied. Four anuran species (Rhinella fernandezae [Bufonidae]; juvenile and adult of Leptodactylus latrans [Leptodactylidae]; and the hylids Hypsiboas pulchellus and Pseudis minuta) were monitored and tissue samples were collected for Bd diagnosis and quantification. All species tested positive for Bd, but anurans inhabiting the UCA were twice more likely to be infected than those in the CA. Prevalence and infection level were significantly higher in the UCA, suggesting that vulnerability to Bd is associated with land use in agro-ecosystems. At the assemblage-level, the infection patterns also differed among species, and those with aquatic habitats (L. latrans and P. minuta) had high prevalence and infection levels of Bd. Juvenile stages of L. latrans had higher prevalence and infection level than adults in both study areas. This work contributes to our understanding of anthropogenic effects on host-pathogen relationships, particularly on the effect of Bd on anuran assemblages under different levels of agricultural impact.

TI  - Cascading effects of a disease outbreak in a remote protected area
T2  - ECOLOGY LETTERS
AB  - Disease outbreaks induced by humans increasingly threaten wildlife communities worldwide. Like predators, pathogens can be key top-down forces in ecosystems, initiating trophic cascades that may alter food webs. An outbreak of mange in a remote Andean protected area caused a dramatic population decline in a mammalian herbivore (the vicuna), creating conditions to test the cascading effects of disease on the ecological community. By comparing a suite of ecological measurements to pre-disease baseline records, we demonstrate that mange restructured tightly linked trophic interactions previously driven by a mammalian predator (the puma). Following the mange outbreak, scavenger (Andean condor) occurrence in the ecosystem declined sharply and plant biomass and cover increased dramatically in predation refuges where herbivory was historically concentrated. The evidence shows that a disease-induced trophic cascade, mediated by vicuna density, could supplant the predator-induced trophic cascade, mediated by vicuna behaviour, thereby transforming the Andean ecosystem.

TI  - Morphological description of <i>Pintomyia</i> (<i>Pifanomyia</i>) <i>veintemillasi</i> n. sp., a new sand fly species from the sub-Andean region of Bolivia
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
AB  - Background: Most sand fly species are located in the Americas; some act as vectors of leishmaniasis and other human diseases. In Bolivia, about 25% of Neotropical species have been identified, and only a few have been implicated as vectors of cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis. A new species of anthropophilic sand fly from the subAndean region of Alto Beni is described herein.
   Methods: A large systematic entomological survey was carried out in a subtropical humid forest located in the Marimonos mountain range, at around 900 m altitude, in the municipality of Palos Blancos, Sud Yungas Province, Department of La Paz, Bolivia. Sand flies were captured over a period of 26 months between January 1982 and February 1984, at the ground and canopy level, using both CDC light traps and protected human bait. A total of 24,730 sand flies were collected on the ground, distributed in 16 species, and 3259 in the canopy, with eight species. One of these species was labeled as Pintomia (Pifanomyia) nevesi, although certain morphological features allowed us to doubt that it was that taxon. To define the identity of this sand fly, a re-evaluation (this work) was recently carried out through morphological analyses and measurements of the available specimens mounted on Euparal, previously labeled as Pi. (Pif) nevesi.
   Results: Based on the morphological traits and measurements, the re-evaluated specimens were definitively identified as a new sand fly species, Pintomyia (Pifanomyia) veintemillasi, closely related to Pi. (Pif) nevesi and Pintomyia (Pifanomyia) maranonensis within the Evansi series. This new sand fly was the third most numerous anthropophilic species at the floor (6.2%) and the second most numerous anthropophilic at the canopy (35.1%).
   Conclusions: A new anthropophilic sand fly species is described as Pi. (Pif) veintemillasi n. sp. This sand fly species was caught at about 900 m altitude in the Marimonos mountain range, a highly endemic area for cutaneous and mucosal leishmaniasis due to Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis. Therefore, this species could be involved in the leishmaniasis transmission in the sub-Andean foothills of Alto Beni, Department of La Paz, Bolivia.

TI  - Sustainability indicators regarding tourism development and coral reef conservation: A case study of Akumal, in the Mexican Caribbean
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 1999 NORTHEASTERN RECREATION RESEARCH SYMPOSIUM
CP  - 1999 Northeastern Recreation Research Symposium
AB  - As with many coastal communities in the Caribbean, the tourism industry of Akumal Mexico depends upon a healthy marine environment. Today's tourists are more environmentally conscious than ever, and are likely to choose a different destination if the beaches are littered, the seawater is polluted, or the corals are ruined. Recently, the condition of Akumal's coral reef appears to have degraded - coral coverage seems to have decreased while algae growth and disease appear to have increased. Since this coincides with Akumal's recent growth of tourism development, researchers speculate that the reefs degradation may be correlated with the tourism industry. Therefore, it is critically important to monitor Akumal's social, economic, cultural, and political components as they relate to the condition of the coral reef offshore. Armed with that information, the Akumal community will have a better chance of finding an acceptable balance between the two.
   The purpose of this research was to conceptualize sustainability indicators that explain the linkages between Akumal's tourism development and the health of the coral reef offshore. Following the Pressure-State-Response model, 22 sustainability indicators were identified by a group of 24 community stakeholders. These indicators were conceptualized during a Stakeholder meeting and were refined through a modified Delphi process (electronic mail and personal interviews). Based on literature review and suggestions from the Stakeholders, I developed monitoring protocols and collected primary and/or secondary data for each indicator. Throughout the research process, the List of indicators was continually refined so that the variables were feasible, efficient and effective.
   Also included in the full document is a historiography of previous research regarding Akumal's reef, plus an extensive literature review of anthropogenic impacts on coral reefs, Caribbean tourism development, and sustainability indicators. The research concludes with 7 "lessons learned" that might be useful for other researchers who are investigating sustainability indicators. Future plans include the creation of a comprehensive monitoring manual that can be utilized by Akumal's school children. Suggested applications of this research include the development of a "tropical marine environment protocol" for the GLOBE program (Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment), so that children around the world can become involved in coral reef conservation.

TI  - Behavioural heterogeneity of <i>Anopheles</i> species in ecologically different localities in Southeast Asia:: a challenge for vector control
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE & INTERNATIONAL HEALTH
AB  - In Southeast Asia the biodiversity of Anopheles species in the domestic environment is very high. Only few species are considered major vectors throughout the region, whereas the vector status of other species varies from area to area. Often it is difficult to identify an Anopheles species as a malaria vector in areas with low malaria incidence. The behaviour of Anopheles species largely determines their vector status, and insights into their behaviour are essential to evaluate the appropriateness of vector control measures. This study was conducted in six ecologically different localities in Southeast Asia to rank the different Anopheles species in terms of anthropophily and endophagy in order to estimate their current epidemiological importance. Concurrently, the biting and resting behaviour of the vectors was analysed to evaluate the appropriateness of insecticide-impregnated bed nets and residual house spraying in vector control. Anopheles dirus A was highly anthropophilic at all sites where it occurred. By contrast, the degree of anthropophily exhibited by An. minimus A depended on availability of cattle. Anopheles campestris, An. nimpe, An. sinensis, An. maculatus, An. aconitus showed a high degree of anthropophily in certain villages, indicating their potential of participating in malaria transmission, although the actual incidence of malaria in the study villages can be fully explained by transmission of the major vectors (An. dirus A, An. minimus A and An. sundaicus). Late biting of An. minimus A and biting activity throughout the night of An. sundaicus favour bed nets as a control method for these species, whilst exophilic and outdoor biting in combination with early feeding behaviour of An. dirus A will make both insecticide-impregnated bed nets and indoor residual spraying less suitable for controlling this species. Spatial variation in biting and resting behaviour was observed within almost all Anopheles species. These heterogeneities may result in the differences in epidemiological importance and in response to vector control of Anopheles species in different areas. Moreover, environmental changes and changes in human practice are expected to influence the behaviour, hence the role of the different species in malaria transmission. The effect of environmental changes on vector behaviour should be followed up carefully.

TI  - Wild Brazilian species of Eugenia genera (Myrtaceae) as an innovation hotspot for food and pharmacological purposes
T2  - FOOD RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL
AB  - The Myrtaceae is one of the most common plant families in Brazil, including > 1000 species of native fruit spread from North to South, where around 50% of all species are endemic to the Atlantic Rain Forest Biome. Most Brazilian species belong to Eugenia, Campomanesia, Psidium and Myrciaria genera. In general, they are characterized by the presence of leaves opposite, simple, entire, with pellucid glands containing ethereal oils and produces berry-like, fleshy fruits with a wide diversity of beneficial characteristics. Several parts of these plants are widely used in regional folk medicine as an astringent, anti-inflammatory, antihypertensive, to treat gastrointestinal disorders, and so on. Some species have already been studied and most of their metabolic effects are attributed to the presence of polyphenols, carotenoids as well as sesquiterpenes and monoterpenes. In addition, the Myrtaceae family has great economic potential, because of the sensory characteristics which encourages their commercial exploitation plus the presence of phytochemicals which play an important role in managing several degenerative chronic diseases besides representing a hotspot of technological innovation for food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical purposes. In this context, this review discusses about the importance of some Eugenia genera representatives such as Eugenia uniflora, Eugenia stipitata, Eugenia brasiliensis, Eugenia pyriforrnis and Eugenia dysenterica, emphasizing its profile of bioactive compounds as well as the knowledge of the nutritional and functional fruit potential, providing information for further studies aiming to stimulate the cultivation of Brazilian wild berries, for consumption and new food ingredients.

TI  - Optimization of In Vivo Production of <i>Spodoptera frugiperda</i> multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (SfMNPV)
T2  - NEOTROPICAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - Insect viruses have been used to protect crops and forests worldwide for decades. Among insect viruses, isolates of Spodoptera frugiperda multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (SfMNPV) have proven potential for the control of Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith) (FAW) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), a pest of many economically essential crops across several continents. Mass production of SfMNPV depends on an in vivo system using host insect rearing. However, many factors can limit its production, including abiotic factors and host characteristics, such as the stage of development and an antagonist intraspecific interaction. Thus, to improve in vivo production, we verified the most suitable larval age to inoculate the virus and the influence of incubation temperature on viral production. Subsequently, cannibal behavior was verified in FAW larvae reared at different densities, while reproducing the conditions of the best treatments. The highest viral yield occurred when FAW larvae were inoculated at 10 and 8 days old and incubated at 22 degrees C and 25 degrees C, respectively. Nonetheless, survival (lethal period in days) and cannibal behavior were positively influenced by larval development, which potentially increases the load of contamination and requires larval individualization for these production conditions. In contrast, 4-day-old larvae, which were inoculated and incubated at 31 degrees C, also demonstrated high viral production, with lower rates of cannibalism and death on the same day, thereby showing potential. The information presented in this study is useful for the optimization of the in vivo production systems of SfMNPV.

TI  - Multitrophic interactions between <i>coccinellid</i>s and their parasitoids in natural and managed plant systems: host plant and aphid prey species matter
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TROPICAL INSECT SCIENCE
AB  - Multi-trophic and multispecies interactions among family of arthropods assemblages are ubiquitous and include all type of interactions from mutualistic to antagonistic. To better inform the biological control of aphids, the multitrophic interactions between aphids, coccinellids and their parasitoids in natural and managed plant systems were examined over a span of 4 years. Coccinellid larvae naturally found feeding on aphids on two non-crop plants growing in agricultural landscapes in Pakistan were studied; Aphis nerii Boyer de Fonscolombe (Hemiptera: Aphididae) feeding on Calotropis procera Aiton, and Nerium oleander L, and four crop host; Lipaphis erysimi Kalt (Hemiptera: Aphididae) feeding on Eurica sativa Mill. and Brassica campestris L., Uroleucon compositae Theobold (Hemiptera: Aphididae) feeding on Carthamus tinctorius L., and Diuraphis noxia Mordvilko (Hemiptera: Aphididae) feeding on Hordeum vulgare L.; were collected throughout the aphid season and reared on their respective aphid-plant combinations in the laboratory conditions to identify coccinellid species, their parasitoids and asses their performance in items of survival and pupal weight. The coccinellid pupal weight on different host plant-aphid combinations varied from 3.4 to 11.2 mg, as did the mortality of coccinellid larvae due to diseases and unknown causes (5 to 31%). Parasitism of coccinellid larvae by Homalotylus flaminus (Dalman) (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae) ranged from approximately 10 to 30 in B. campestris and E. sativa, respectively. The parasitism of coccinellid pupae by Oomyzus scaposus (Thomson) (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) ranged between 17 (C. procera) to 41% (B. compestris). One Dinocampus coccinellae Schrank (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) was reared. Coccinellids displayed selectivity towards host plants and aphids. Some coccinellids were never or rarely recorded on a particular aphid-plant combination, suggesting that their prey selection is more specific than often assumed. Management decision and conservation biological control cannot be based on superficial categories such as "aphids" and "coccinellids" but need to be plant and species specific.

TI  - Alkaloid profile in <i>Pyrolirion</i> <i>albicans</i> Herb. (Amaryllidaceae), a Peruvian endemic species
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
AB  - The Amaryllidaceae family is widely distributed in different regions of the neotropics and temperate areas of the world. Species of the subfamily Amaryllidoideae are unique in producing the alkaloid galanthamine, which inhibits the action of acetylcholinesterase and is used for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. In Peru, 15 genera and 68 species belonging to the Amaryllidoideae have been reported in different types of forest, ranging from wet montane to dry, as well as the sandy biomes of the Pacific coastal region, with the greatest diversity in the south. In the tribe Eustephieae, the Andean genus Pyrolirion Herb has eight species, six of which are endemic to Peru.
   In this work, the leaves and bulbs of Pyrolirion albicans were analyzed for their alkaloid content for the first time, using gas chromatography (GC) coupled to mass spectrometry (MS). The alkaloids determined in the leaves were galanthamine, chlidanthine, tazettine and lycorine and those in the bulbs were galanthamine, N-demethylgalanthamine, vittatine/crinine, montanine, pancracine, sternbergine, lycorine and hippeastrine. Owing to their important bioactive properties, the high quantity of montanine and galanthamine determined in the bulbs is of particular interest. (C) 2020 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Triatominae (Hemiptera, Reduviidae) in the Pantanal region: association with <i>Trypanosoma cruzi</i>, different habitats and vertebrate hosts
T2  - REVISTA DA SOCIEDADE BRASILEIRA DE MEDICINA TROPICAL
AB  - Introduction: The transmission cycle of Trypanosoma cruzi in the Brazilian Pantanal region has been studied during the last decade. Although considerable knowledge is available regarding the mammalian hosts infected by T. cruzi in this wetland, no studies have investigated its vectors in this region. This study aimed to investigate the presence of sylvatic triatomine species in different habitats of the Brazilian Pantanal region and to correlate their presence with the occurrences of vertebrate hosts and T. cruzi infection. Methods: The fieldwork involved passive search by using light traps and Noireau traps and active search by visual inspection. The light traps were placed at five selected points along forested areas for seven nights during each of the nine excursions. At each point where a light trap was set, eight Noireau traps were placed in palm trees and bromeliads. Results: In all, 88 triatomine bugs were collected: two and one individuals from light traps and Noireau traps, respectively; three from peridomestic areas; 23 in coati nests; and 59 in thornbird nests. In this study, active search in microhabitats showed higher efficiency than passive search, since 95% of the triatomine bugs were caught in nests. Further, triatomine bugs were only found to be infected by T. cruzi in coati nests. Conclusions: Coati nests might act as a point of convergence and dispersion for triatomine bugs and mammal hosts infected by T. cruzi, thereby playing an important role in the sylvatic cycle of T. cruzi in the Pantanal region.

TI  - One Health Approach in Serosurvey of <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> in Former Black Slave (Quilombola) Communities in Southern Brazil and Among Their Dogs
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE
AB  - Brazilian quilombos are rural semi-isolated remnant communities of former black slaves and their descendants who traditionally maintained themselves through archaic subsistence livestock and agriculture practices and historically lacked specific public health policies. Although such individuals and their dogs may be exposed to zoonotic pathogens such as Toxoplasma gondii, no study to date has assessed these human-animal populations together. Populations in four different Brazilian quilombos in southern Brazil were evaluated. Overall, 93/208 people (44.7%) and 63/100 dogs (63.0%) were seropositive for IgG anti-T. gondii antibodies by indirect immunofluorescent antibody test (IFAT), 4/208 (1.9%) human samples seropositive for IgM anti-T. gondii antibodies, with a human-dog seropositivity ratio for IgG of 0.71. Quilombola individuals ingesting game meat were 2.43-fold more likely (95% CI: 1.05-5.9) to be seropositive. No risk factors were associated with seropositivity among dogs, thus suggesting that their exposure to T. gondii was random. Surprisingly, our research group had previously found an inverted human-dog ratio for T. gondii seropositivity of 2.54 in the urban area of a nearby major city. Because consumption of raw/undercooked game meat by quilombola individuals may have contributed to higher exposure, higher overall seroprevalence among dogs may have also indicated interaction with wildlife. Although these dogs may hunt wildlife without their owners' awareness, the higher dog seropositivity may also be related to feeding from discarded food in the community or backyard livestock animals and drinking surface water contaminated with oocysts. Thus, wildlife cannot be singled out as the reason, and future studies should consider sampling water, soil, wildlife, and livestock tissues, to fully establish the source of infection in dogs herein.

TI  - The phytoplasma associated with Bogia coconut syndrome in Papua New Guinea is a new phytoplasma in the group of the lethal yellowing syndromes (LYTS) of coconut and other palms
T2  - TROPICAL PLANT PATHOLOGY
AB  - Coconut significantly contributes to nutrition and livelihoods of more than 8 million Asia-Pacific households and is specifically linked to the livelihoods of more than 1.5 million people in Papua New Guinea (PNG). Coconut diversity of the region is conserved, on behalf of COGENT (International Coconut Genetic Resources Network) in PNG's international coconut gene bank (ICG), which is threatened by a new lethal phytoplasma disease, Bogia coconut syndrome (BCS). Symptoms are related to lethal yellowing type syndrome (LYTS). A phytoplasma was identified in coconuts affected by BCS of coconuts but also with the palm Areca catechu and bananas. As a necessary precursor to effective disease management, this study aimed to better understand the nature of this phytoplasma using molecular analyses of the 16S rRNA-encoding gene, ribosomal protein gene, and secA gene, to characterize its genotype and compare it with any similar known phytoplasmas associated with other LYTS from the Caribbean and Africa. In the target area near to the ICG, tissue samples were taken from coconut, areca palms, and banana plants. DNA was extracted and analyzed, and phylogenetic trees and networks then drawn up to make comparisons with the known phytoplasma genotypes associated with LYTS from Cuba, the Dominican Republic (D.R), Ghana, Mexico, Mozambique, and Tanzania. Our study showed that the same phytoplasma was consistently associated with both BCS and areca samples and the banana wilt. The same unique sequence can be considered a new, genetically distinct phytoplasma and is a new member of the LYTS group, the first one in the Asian-Pacific region.

TI  - Knowledge of health workers on snakes and snakebite management and treatment seeking behavior of snakebite victims in Bhutan
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Author summary
   Snakebites affect people globally including Bhutan and snakes are source of fear and excitement. Major proportion (62.7%) of Bhutanese population who thrive on agro-farming, rearing livestock, and searching forest produces are at risk of snake envenomations. Deaths due to snakebites are dependent upon use of first aid type, provisions available with the health facilities, and health seeking behaviors of snakebite victims. This multi-center study was conducted to assess the level of knowledge of health workers and its association with their demographic features and health seeking behavior of snakebite victims as observed by health workers using investigator administered structured questionnaire. We included 12 hospitals and a Basic Health Unit (BHU) from 10 snakebite prone Dzongkhags with 962 (84%) snakebites from January 2013 to December 2017 in the country. Among 118 health workers interviewed, 27 (23%) had adequate level of knowledge with remaining 91 (77%) having inadequate knowledge. Male health workers and Doctors had better level of knowledge than other demographic groups. Health workers from Sarpang scored higher compared to those from other Dzongkhags. A total of 42% (n = 50) health workers scored below 60% (31 or less correct responses for 52 questions), which demands requirement of training and inclusion of practice-oriented courses in training curriculum of health professionals for snakebite management. Often, use of traditional medication and less frequent adherence to WHO recommended first aid measures was observed by 5% (n = 6) respondents. The adoption of non-recommended treatment practices seems to delay proper treatment resulting in gangrene and associated complications.
   Background
   Published information on snakebite is rare in Bhutan although remarkably higher number of snakebites and associated deaths are reported from other South Asian countries.
   Aims and methodology
   Structured questionnaire was used to collect knowledge of health workers in snakebite management and health seeking behavior of snakebite victims as observed by health workers. Study was conducted in purposively sampled 10 Dzongkhags (district level administrative units) with higher incidence of snakebites.
   Result
   Heath workers scored 27-91% (with an average of 63%, SD = 14) for 52 questions related to snake identification and snakebite management. Among 118 health workers interviewed, 23% had adequate knowledge on snakes and snakebite management while 77% had inadequate knowledge. Among 32 Doctors, 63% of them scored above or equal to 75%. Health workers from Sarpang scored higher (76%, SD = 11) than those from other Dzongkhags. Snakebite victim's visit to local (traditional) healers prior to seeking medical help from hospital was observed by 75 (63%) health workers. Fifty one percent of health workers observed patients treated with local methods such as the use of black stone called Jhhar Mauro (believed to absorb snake venom), application of honey, rubbing of green herbal paste made up of Khenpa Shing (Artemisia myriantha Wallich ex Besser var. paleocephala [Pamp] Ling) and consumption of fluid made up of Neem leaf (Azadirachta indica Juss). Use of tight tourniquet as a first aid to snakebite was observed by 80% of the health workers.
   Conclusion
   Health workers lack confidence in snakebite management. Snakebite victims are likely to suffer from harmful local practices and traditional beliefs on local treatment practices. Empowering health workers with adequate knowledge on snakebite management and making locals aware in pre-hospital care of snakebites are needed to improve the pre- and in-hospital management of snakebite in Bhutan.

TI  - Nonparametric assessment of mangrove ecosystem in the context of coastal resilience in Ghana
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB  - Cloud cover effects make it difficult to evaluate the mangrove ecosystem in tropical locations using solely optical satellite data. Therefore, it is essential to conduct a more precise evaluation using data from several sources and appropriate models in order to manage the mangrove ecosystem as effectively as feasible. In this study, the status of the mangrove ecosystem and its potential contribution to coastal resilience were evaluated using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) and the InVEST model. The GEE was used to map changes in mangrove and other land cover types for the years 2009 and 2019 by integrating both optical and radar data. The quantity allocation disagreement index (QADI) was used to assess the classification accuracy. Mangrove height and aboveground biomass density were estimated using GEE by extracting their values from radar image clipped with a digital elevation model and mangrove vector file. A universal allometric equation that relates canopy height to aboveground biomass was applied. The InVEST model was used to calculate a hazard index of every 250 m of the shoreline with and without mangrove ecosystem. Our result showed that about 16.9% and 21% of mangrove and other vegetation cover were lost between 2009 and 2019. However, water body and bare land/built-up areas increased by 7% and 45%, respectively. The overall accuracy of 2009 and 2019 classifications was 99.6% (QADI = 0.00794) and 99.1% (QADI = 0.00529), respectively. Mangrove height and aboveground biomass generally decreased from 12.7 to 6.3 m and from 105 to 88 Mg/ha on average. The vulnerability index showed that 23%, 51% and 26% of the coastal segment in the presence of mangrove fall under very low/low, moderate and high risks, respectively. Whereas in the absence of mangrove, 8%, 38%, 39% and 15% fall under low, moderate, high and very high-risk zones, respectively. This study will among other things help the stakeholders in coastal management and marine spatial planning to identify the need to focus on conservation practices.

TI  - Land use and land cover change and its impacts on dengue dynamics in China: A systematic review
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   Dengue is a prioritized public health concern in China. Because of the larger scale, more frequent and wider spatial distribution, the challenge for dengue prevention and control has increased in recent years. While land use and land cover (LULC) change was suggested to be associated with dengue, relevant research has been quite limited. The "Open Door" policy introduced in 1978 led to significant LULC change in China. This systematic review is the first to review the studies on the impacts of LULC change on dengue dynamics in China. This review aims at identifying the research evidence, research gaps and provide insights for future research.
   Methods
   A systematic literature review was conducted following the PRISMA protocol. The combinations of search terms on LULC, dengue and its vectors were searched in the databases PubMed, Web of Science, and Baidu Scholar. Research conducted on China published from 1978 to December 2019 and written in English or Chinese was selected for further screening. References listed in articles meeting the inclusion criteria were also reviewed and included if again inclusion criteria were met to minimize the probability of missing relevant research.
   Results
   28 studies published between 1978 and 2017 were included for the full review. Guangdong Province and southern Taiwan were the major regional foci in the literature. The majority of the reviewed studies observed associations between LULC change factors and dengue incidence and distribution. Conflictive evidence was shown in the studies about the impacts of green space and blue space on dengue in China. Transportation infrastructure and urbanization were repeatedly suggested to be positively associated with dengue incidence and spread. The majority of the studies reviewed considered meteorological and sociodemographic factors when they analyzed the effects of LULC change on dengue. Primary and secondary remote sensing (RS) data were the primary source for LULC variables. In 21 of 28 studies, a geographic information system (GIS) was used to process data of environmental variables and dengue cases and to perform spatial analysis of dengue.
   Conclusions
   The effects of LULC change on the dynamics of dengue in China varied in different periods and regions. The application of RS and GIS enriches the means and dimensions to explore the relations between LULC change and dengue. Further comprehensive regional research is necessary to assess the influence of LULC change on local dengue transmission to provide practical advice for dengue prevention and control.
   Author summary
   Dengue is a major public health concern in China. The rapid development of urbanization along with climate change increases the challenge for dengue prevention and control. Previous research has mainly focused on the meteorological variables whereas land use and land cover (LULC) change received comparatively less attention. Our review identified that the regional research hotspots of dengue epidemics in China were Guangdong Province and southern Taiwan. Though inconsistent, most included studies somehow observed associations between at least one of the LULC change factors and dengue. A geographical information system (GIS) was widely used to perform spatial analysis in the selected literature. Its application provided a novel view to describe the relationships between environmental factors and the situation of dengue, which enabled scholars to explore more characteristics of dengue transmission. Meanwhile, the use of remote sensing (RS) enriched the means of environmental monitoring. However, there are research gaps in the area of dengue and LULC change, such as the less consideration of dengue vector study, the lack of interplays between factors, and the lack of considering interventions and policies. Furthermore, because of different research settings, results from these studies were difficult to compare. Thus, further comprehensive and comparable investigations are necessary to better understand the effects of LULC change on dengue in China. This review is the first to expound the studies on the associations between LULC change and dengue dynamics in China. It demonstrates the findings and methodologies and provided insights for future research.

TI  - Description of two new species of <i>Plesiopelma</i> (Araneae, Theraphosidae, Theraphosinae) from Argentina
T2  - IHERINGIA SERIE ZOOLOGIA
AB  - Two new species of Plesiopelma Pocock, 1901 from northern Argentina are described and diagnosed based on males and habitat descriptions are presented. Males of Plesiopelma paganoi sp. nov. differ from most of species by the absence of spiniform setae on the retrolateral face of cymbium, aspect of the palpal bulb. Plesiopelma aspidosperma sp. nov. differs from most species of the genus by the presence of spiniform setae on the retrolateral face of cymbium and it can be distinguished from P. myodes Pocock, 1901, P. longisternale (Schiapelli & Gerschman, 1942) and P. rectimanum (Mello-Leitao, 1923) by the separated palpal bulb keels and basal nodule of metatarsus I very developed. It differs from P. minense (Mello-Leitao, 1943) by the shape of the palpal bulb and basal nodule on metatarsus I well developed. Specimens were captured in Salta province, Argentina, inhabiting high cloud forests of Yungas eco-region.

TI  - Bioassay-guided study of the anti-inflammatory effect of <i>Anoectochilus burmannicus</i> ethanolic extract in RAW 264.7 cells
T2  - JOURNAL OF ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY
AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Anoectochilus species is a small terrestrial orchid found in tropical and subtropical rain forest. These orchids are traditionally used extensively in China, Taiwan, and Vietnam due to their medicinal properties and therapeutic benefits. They are employed for treatment in different systems, such as stomach disorders, chest pain, arthritis, tumor, piles, boils, menstrual disorders, and inflammation. Aqueous extract of Anoectochilus burmannicus (AB) has been previously reported to exhibit anti-inflammatory activities, however there is a lack of evidence regarding its bioactive compounds and the mechanism of its actions.
   Aim of the study: The objectives of this study were to identify the anti-inflammatory compound(s) in an ethanolic extract of AB and to determine its anti-inflammatory mechanisms in LPS-stimulated macrophages and also its safety.
   Materials and methods: The ethanolic extract of AB (ABE) was prepared and subsequently subjected to polaritydependent extraction using n-hexane and ethyl acetate, which would result in isolation of the n-hexane (ABH), ethyl acetate (ABEA), and residue or aqueous (ABA) fractions. The AB fractions were investigated to determine total phenolic and flavonoid content, antioxidant capacity, toxicity, and safety in RAW 264.7 macrophages, human PBMCs, and RBCs. After extraction anti-inflammation screening of each extract was performed by nitric oxide (NO) production assay. The active fractions were further examined for their effect on proinflammatory mediators. In addition, kinsenoside content in the active fractions was identified using LC-MS/MS. Cellular toxicity and genotoxicity of AB were also tested using the wing spot test in Drosophila melanogaster.
   Results: The data showed that ABEA had the highest phenolic content and level of antioxidant activities. ABE, ABEA, and ABA, but not ABH, significantly inhibited the LPS-stimulated NO production in the macrophages. Both ABEA and ABA reduced LPS-mediated expression of TNF-alpha, IL-6, iNOS, and COX-2 at both mRNA and protein levels. Besides, only ABEA notably diminished the LPS-stimulated p65 phosphorylation required for nuclear translocation and transcriptional activation of the nuclear factor-.B (NF-kappa B). Interestingly, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis revealed ABA contained a high level of kinsenoside, a likely anti-inflammatory compound, while ABE and ABEA might require other compounds in combination with kinsenoside for the inhibition of inflammation. It was shown that all active fractions were neither cytotoxic nor genotoxic.
   Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that the hydrophilic fractions of AB exhibit anti-inflammatory activity in LPS-stimulated macrophages. The mechanism used by the AB involves the scavenging of free radicals and the reduction of proinflammatory mediators, including IL-1 beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, NO, iNOS and COX-2. The antiinflammatory action of AB involves the suppression of the NF-kappa B signaling pathway by some unknown component(s) present in ABEA. This study found that kinsenoside is a major active compound in ABA which could be used as a biomarker for the quality control of the plant extraction. This study provides convincing significant information in vitro regarding the anti-inflammatory mechanism and preliminary evidence of the safety of Anoectochilus burmanicus. Therefore, the knowledge acquired from this study would provide supportive evidence for the development and standardization of the use of the extract of this plant as alternative medicine or functional food to prevent or treat non-communicable chronic diseases related to chronic inflammation.

TI  - Medicinal plant use, conservation, and the associated traditional knowledge in rural communities in Eastern Uganda
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HEALTH
AB  - Background The global consumption of herbal medicine is increasing steadily, posing an extinction risk to medicinal plants. Uganda is among the top ten countries with a high threat of herbal medicine extinction, and Traditional Medicinal Knowledge (TMK) erosion. This might be attributed to the inadequate documentation, plus many more unclear hindrances. In this study, plant species used to treat human diseases in Butaleja district in Eastern Uganda and their associated TMK were documented. The conservation methods for medicinal plants were also evaluated. The rationale was to support the preservation of ethnopharmacological knowledge. Methods Data were collected from 80 herbalists using semi-structured questionnaires, from July 2020 to March 2021. Additionally, guided field walks and observations were conducted. Quantitative indices such as, use categories and informant consensus factor (ICF) were evaluated to elucidate the importance of the medicinal plants. Data were analyzed using STATA version-15.0 software. Results In total, 133 species, belonging to 34 families and 125 genera were identified. Fabaceae (65%), and Solanaceae (29%) were the dominant families. Leaves (80%), and roots (15%), were the commonest parts used in medicinal preparations; mostly administered orally as decoctions (34.6%) and infusions (16%). The commonest illnesses treated were cough (7.74%), gastric ulcers (7.42%), and malaria (4.52%). The informant consensus factor was high for all disease categories (>= 0.8), indicating homogeneity of knowledge about remedies used. Only 73% of the respondents made efforts to conserve medicinal plants. The commonest conservation strategy was preservation of forests with spiritually valued species (100%), while compliance with government regulations was the rarest (4.5%). Overall, efforts to stop the extinction of medicinal plants and TMK were inadequate. Conclusion and recommendations There was enormous dependency on a rich diversity of medicinal plant species and TMK for healthcare and income generation. The potential for medicinal plant biodiversity loss was evident due to habitat destruction. Inclusion of traditional cultural norms in conservation strategies, and laboratory-based efficacy tests for the species identified are necessary, to promote the conservative and utilization of validated herbal medicines and TMK in rural settings.

TI  - Metabolomics and machine learning technique revealed that germination enhances the multi-nutritional properties of pigmented rice
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY
AB  - Enhancing the dietary properties of rice is crucial to contribute to alleviating hidden hunger and non-communicable diseases in rice-consuming countries. Germination is a bioprocessing approach to increase the bioavailability of nutrients in rice. However, there is a scarce information on how germination impacts the overall nutritional profile of pigmented rice sprouts (PRS). Herein, we demonstrated that germination resulted to increase levels of certain dietary compounds, such as free phenolics and micronutrients (Ca, Na, Fe, Zn, riboflavin, and biotin). Metabolomic analysis revealed the preferential accumulation of dipeptides, GABA, and flavonoids in the germination process. Genome-wide association studies of the PRS suggested the activation of specific genes such as CHS1 and UGT genes responsible for increasing certain flavonoid compounds. Haplotype analyses showed a significant difference (P < 0.05) between alleles associated with these genes. Genetic markers associated with these flavonoids were incorporated into the random forest model, improving the accuracy of prediction of multi-nutritional properties from 89.7% to 97.7%. Deploying this knowledge to breed rice with multi-nutritional properties will be timely to address double burden nutritional challenges.

TI  - Impact of repeated large scale ivermectin treatments on the transmission of <i>Loa loa</i>
T2  - TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - We have studied the impact of large-scale treatment with ivermectin on the transmission of loiasis in a forest village in south Cameroon where loiasis was highly endemic, with a prevalence of 30%. After one year of parasitological and entomological surveillance without treatment, all consenting residents aged >5 years received ivermectin 200 mu g/kg every 3 months. For ethical reasons, treatment was interrupted after 2 years, but parasitological and entomological surveillance continued for 18 months after the end of treatment. The prevalence of loiasis was reduced to <10% and the mean microfilaraemia decreased by 90% in 2 years. The prevalence and average intensity of infection remained stable during the 18 months after treatment ended. Two vector species were identified, Chrysops dimidiata (representing about 90% of the fly population) and C. silacea. The infection rate (all stages) in Chrysops decreased by 75% and the infective rate (percentage of Chrysops harbouring third-stage larvae of Loa loa in the head) decreased by 85% in C. dimidiata and became zero in C. silacea. After the end of treatment, the infection and infective rates increased gradually. Large-scale treatment seemed an efficient method for the control of L. loa transmission provided high drug coverage was achieved. Nevertheless, because of the high risk of adverse effects when using the current microfilaricidal drugs, such a strategy remains unacceptable.

T2  - ZOOLOGICAL STUDIES
AB  - Bark and ambrosia beetles are a diverse group that causes widespread mortality of deciduous and coniferous trees. The present study aimed to investigate the species compositions and richnesses of bark and ambrosia beetles in six species of plant hosts in East Java, Indonesia. Bark and ambrosia beetles were sampled using bottle traps baited with ethanol. Studies were conducted at two sites of monoculture and polyculture systems for each host plant species. At each site, 20 ethanol-baited traps were deployed on a linear transect along the forest. Six host tree species examined were used, namely Tectona grandis (Teak), Syzygium aromaticum (Clove), Swietenia mahagoni (Mahogany), Pinus merkusii (Sumatran Pine), Paraserianthes falcataria (Moluccan Albizia), and Mangifera indica (Mango). The data were analyzed using R software. A total of 4823 beetles were collected, representing 26 ambrosia beetle and eight bark beetle species. The abundance of bark and ambrosia beetles was significantly highest at the sites of T. grandis (F = 13.88, P < 0.01). Xylosandrus crassiusculus showed a strong attraction to the ethanol lure and was the dominant beetle species (50.65% of the total number of individuals). The Shannon-Wiener diversity index of all beetles captured in this study was the highest in the S. mahogany polyculture (2.28) and the lowest in the T. grandis polyculture (0.47). According to Bray-Curtis analysis, the T. grandis monoculture and T. grandis polyculture had a high similarity value of bark and ambrosia beetle species compositions (91% similar). There were no significant differences between two cultural systems of host plants in the compositions of bark and ambrosia beetle species (ANOSIM, R =-0.1537, P = 0.961).

TI  - Viral and Epidemiological Determinants of the Invasion Dynamics of Novel Dengue Genotypes
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background: Dengue has become a major concern for international public health. Frequent epidemic outbreaks are believed to be driven by a complex interplay of immunological interactions between its four co-circulating serotypes and large fluctuations in mosquito densities. Viral lineage replacement events, caused for example by different levels of cross-protection or differences in viral fitness, have also been linked to a temporary change in dengue epidemiology. A major replacement event was recently described for South-East Asia where the Asian-1 genotype of dengue serotype 2 replaced the resident Asian/American type. Although this was proposed to be due to increased viral fitness in terms of enhanced human-to-mosquito transmission, no major change in dengue epidemiology could be observed.
   Methods/Results: Here we investigate the invasion dynamics of a novel, advantageous dengue genotype within a model system and determine the factors influencing the success and rate of fixation as well as their epidemiological consequences. We find that while viral fitness overall correlates with invasion success and competitive exclusion of the resident genotype, the epidemiological landscape plays a more significant role for successful emergence. Novel genotypes can thus face high risks of stochastic extinction despite their fitness advantage if they get introduced during episodes of high dengue prevalence, especially with respect to that particular serotype.
   Conclusion: The rarity of markers for positive selection has often been explained by strong purifying selection whereby the constraints imposed by dengue's two-host cycle are expected to result in a high rate of deleterious mutations. Our results demonstrate that even highly beneficial mutants are under severe threat of extinction, which would suggest that apart from purifying selection, stochastic effects and genetic drift beyond seasonal bottlenecks are equally important in shaping dengue's viral ecology and evolution.

TI  - Biological Diversity in the Patent System
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Biological diversity in the patent system is an enduring focus of controversy but empirical analysis of the presence of biodiversity in the patent system has been limited. To address this problem we text mined 11 million patent documents for 6 million Latin species names from the Global Names Index (GNI) established by the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and Encyclopedia of Life (EOL). We identified 76,274 full Latin species names from 23,882 genera in 767,955 patent documents. 25,595 species appeared in the claims section of 136,880 patent documents. This reveals that human innovative activity involving biodiversity in the patent system focuses on approximately 4% of taxonomically described species and between 0.8-1% of predicted global species. In this article we identify the major features of the patent landscape for biological diversity by focusing on key areas including pharmaceuticals, neglected diseases, traditional medicines, genetic engineering, foods, biocides, marine genetic resources and Antarctica. We conclude that the narrow focus of human innovative activity and ownership of genetic resources is unlikely to be in the long term interest of humanity. We argue that a broader spectrum of biodiversity needs to be opened up to research and development based on the principles of equitable benefit-sharing, respect for the objectives of the Convention on Biological Diversity, human rights and ethics. Finally, we argue that alternative models of innovation, such as open source and commons models, are required to open up biodiversity for research that addresses actual and neglected areas of human need. The research aims to inform the implementation of the 2010 Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization and international debates directed to the governance of genetic resources. Our research also aims to inform debates under the Intergovernmental Committee on Intellectual Property and Genetic Resources, Traditional Knowledge and Folklore at the World Intellectual Property Organization.

TI  - A new focus of <i>Schistosoma mansoni</i> in Yoro village, Mbam and Inoubou Division, Cameroon
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Investigations on intestinal schistosomiasis were carried out in Yoro, a small village located in the transitional zone between forest and savannah, in the Mbam and Inoubou Division of Cameroon. Four human-water contact points were identified in the village and sampled for snails, and the inhabitants underwent parasitologic and clinical surveys to search for signs and symptoms of intestinal schistosomiasis. The results indicated the presence of two freshwater snails, both potential intermediate hosts of Schistosoma sp: Biomphalaria pfeifferi and Bulinus forskalii. However, only the former species was incriminated in the transmission of the disease, with the prevalence of snail infection being 10% (1 of 10) and 14.3% (2 of 14), respectively, during surveys 1 (in the dry season) and 2 (in the rainy season). The overall prevalence of Schistosoma mansoni eggs in stool samples was 54.4% (98 of 180). The mean +/- SD intensity of infection was 100.3 +/- 114.7 eggs per gram of stool. Eggs of S. intercalatum were not detected during parasitologic examination of stool specimens. In Cameroon, it appears that unlike the distribution of S. mansoni, which usually follows that of B. pfeifferi, B. forskalii is commonly found where S. intercalatum does not exist due to competitive exclusion through introgressive hybridization. Of the 180 people included in the study, 52.3% reported abdominal pain and 37.5% had bloody stools. Splenomegaly and hepatomegaly were noted in 11.7% and 3.9%, respectively, of the subjects examined. Three foci of S. mansoni were previously described in the Mbam and Inoubou Division, including Bafia town, Makenene, and Kinding Djabi villages. With the present focus in Yoro, the Mbam and Inoubou Division appears to be the most important endemic zone of S. mansoni in southern Cameroon.

TI  - Temporal phylogeography of <i>Yersinia pestis</i> in Madagascar: Insights into the long-term maintenance of plague
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   Yersinia pestis appears to be maintained in multiple, geographically separate, and phylogenetically distinct subpopulations within the highlands of Madagascar. However, the dynamics of these locally differentiated subpopulations through time are mostly unknown. To address that gap and further inform our understanding of plague epidemiology, we investigated the phylogeography of Y. pestis in Madagascar over an 18 year period.
   Methodology/Principal findings
   We generated whole genome sequences for 31 strains and discovered new SNPs that we used in conjunction with previously identified SNPs and variable-number tandem repeats (VNTRs) to genotype 773 Malagasy Y. pestis samples from 1995 to 2012. We mapped the locations where samples were obtained on a fine geographic scale to examine phylogeographic patterns through time. We identified 18 geographically separate and phylogenetically distinct subpopulations that display spatial and temporal stability, persisting in the same locations over a period of almost two decades. We found that geographic areas with higher levels of topographical relief are associated with greater levels of phylogenetic diversity and that sampling frequency can vary considerably among subpopulations and from year to year. We also found evidence of various Y. pestis dispersal events, including over long distances, but no evidence that any dispersal events resulted in successful establishment of a transferred genotype in a new location during the examined time period.
   Conclusions/Significance
   Our analysis suggests that persistent endemic cycles of Y. pestis transmission within local areas are responsible for the long term maintenance of plague in Madagascar, rather than repeated episodes of wide scale epidemic spread. Landscape likely plays a role in maintaining Y. pestis subpopulations in Madagascar, with increased topographical relief associated with increased levels of localized differentiation. Local ecological factors likely affect the dynamics of individual subpopulations and the associated likelihood of observing human plague cases in a given year in a particular location.

TI  - Occurrence of energetic extreme oceanic events in the Colombian Caribbean coasts and some approaches to assess their impact on ecosystems
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS
AB  - Above-normal meteorological and oceanographic conditions that generate damage on coastal ecosystems and associated human communities are called extreme oceanic events. Accurate data are needed to predict their occurrence and to understand their effects. We analyzed available data from four localities in the Colombian Caribbean to study the effect of wave-related extreme events (hurricanes, surges) in three coastal ecosystems, i.e., mangroves, beaches, and reefs. Three localities were continental (Portete Bay mangroves at the Guajira Peninsula, Bocagrande Public Beach at Cartagena City, Tayrona Natural Park reefs near Santa Marta City), and one was oceanic (Old Providence Island reefs in the San Andres and Old Providence Archipelago, SW Caribbean). We gathered data on ocean surface winds (1978-2011) for the four locations, then modeled significant wave heights, then identified extreme events, and finally tried to identify effects on the ecosystems, directly or from published literature. Wave-related extreme surges were also compiled from Colombian press news (1970-2008). Modeled wave maximums (>5 m significant wave height) and press-reported events coincided with hurricanes, extreme dry season, mid-summer drought and northern hemisphere winter cold fronts, with neither a relationship to ENSO events, nor a temporal trend of increase, excepting Portete Bay, with a marked increase after 1995. Changes in Portete-Bay mangroves were analyzed from aerial photographs before and after Tropical Storm Cesar (1996). In the 38 years before Cesar there was mangrove inland colonization, with some loss associated to beach erosion, while during the 8 years following the storm there were localized retreats and important changes in vegetation composition related to the falling of large trees and subsequent recolonization by species that are faster colonizers, and changes in soil composition brought about by inundation. Cartagena's Bocagrande Beach was followed between 2009 and 2011 by video, and two events of strong retreat were observed in 2010, one associated to the arriving of cold fronts in March, and the other to the passing of Hurricane Tomas in November-December. Together, they produced >90 m beach retreat. We identified modeled wave maximums during Hurricane Lenny (1999) at Santa Marta city, and hurricane Beta (2005) at Old Providence Island, both of which, according to the literature, had transient minor effects on local coral reefs, which had been more affected by diseases and bleaching.

TI  - A new species of <i>Atelopus</i> (Anura: Bufonidae) from southern Peru
T2  - ZOOTAXA
AB  - We describe a new harlequin frog (genus Atelopus) from the cloud forest near Anchihuay (Anco District, Ayacucho Department) from 2000 to 2150 m elevation in southern Peru, representing the first record for the genus in the Department of Ayacucho. The new species has a maximum snout-vent length of 21.5 mm in females and 21.6 mm in males, and resembles A. erythropus in general appearance, small size, and dorsal coloration. The new species can be distinguished from A. erythropus by its unique pattern of ventral coloration, dorsal skin texture, and snout shape. We detected the presence of the pathogenic fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis in individuals of the new species. This pathogen is threatening the survival of harlequin frogs throughout the Neotropics. In addition to chytridiomycosis, habitat loss further threatens the single locality where the new species is known to occur.

TI  - Prevention of lymphatic filariasis with insecticide-treated bednets in Cambodia
T2  - ANNALS OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND PARASITOLOGY
AB  - Potential risk factors for lymphatic filariasis (LF), including the failure to use insecticide-treated bednets (ITN), were studied in four north-eastern provinces of Cambodia, using 43 cases of LF and 248 apparently healthy controls who were matched with the cases in terms of age ( 5 years), gender and village. The results of a univariate matched analysis indicated that lack of ITN [odds ratio (OR)=20.1; 95% confidence interval (CI)=2.2-182.4; P=0.008] and frequent overnight stays in forests or paddy fields outside the village (OR=3.6; CI=1.3-10.0; P=0.012) were the most important risk factors. In a multivariate matched analysis, frequent overnight stays outside the village combined with bednet use showed a clear dose-response relationship, with untreated nets offering significant protection during such stays but ITN offering significantly better protection. Even if villagers used ITN during such stays, they were significantly more likely to develop LF than villagers who did not travel (OR=5.0; CI=1.5-16.3; P=0.008), and if they used untreated or no nets while away they were even more likely than the non-travellers to develop the disease (OR=1413; CI=28.0-71,189; P < 0.001).
   Taken together, these results provide further evidence for the importance of bednet use and their impregnation in the prevention of LF. At least in north-eastern Cambodia, the use of bednets and, preferably, ITN is particularly important during overnight stays outside the home village. In areas where LF is endemic, the sustained distribution of insecticide-treated bednets or hammock nets appears to be a very good idea.

TI  - Transcriptomics in the tropics: Total RNA-based profiling of Costa Rican bromeliad-associated communities
T2  - COMPUTATIONAL AND STRUCTURAL BIOTECHNOLOGY JOURNAL
AB  - RNA-Seq was used to examine the microbial, eukaryotic, and viral communities in water catchments ('tanks') formed by tropical bromeliads from Costa Rica. In total, transcripts with taxonomic affiliation to a wide array of bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes, were observed, as well as RNA-viruses that appeared related to the specific presence of eukaryotes. Bacteria from 25 phyla appeared to comprise the majority of transcripts in one tank (Wg24), compared to only 14 phyla in the other (Wg25). Conversely, eukaryotes from only 16 classes comprised the majority of transcripts in Wg24, compared to 24 classes in the Wg25, revealing a greater eukaryote diversity in the latter. Given that these bromeliads had tanks of similar size (i.e. vertical oxygen gradient), and were neighboring with presumed similar light regime and acquisition of leaf litter through-fall, it is possible that pH was the factor governing these differences in bacterial and eukaryotic communities(Wg24 had a tank pH of 3.6 and Wg25 had a tank pH of 6.2). Archaeal diversity was similar in both tanks, represented by 7 orders, with the exception of Methanocellales transcripts uniquely recovered from Wg25. Based on measures of FPKG (fragments mapped per kilobase of gene length), genes involved in methanogenesis, in addition to a spirochaete flagellin gene, were among those most highly expressed in Wg25. Conversely, aldehyde dehydrogenase and monosaccharide-binding protein were among genes most highly expressed in Wg24. The ability to observe specific presence of insect, plant, and fungi-associated RNA-viruses was unexpected. As with other techniques, there are inherent biases in the use of RNA-Seq, however, these data suggest the possibility of understanding the entire community, including ecological interactions, via simultaneous analysis of microbial, eukaryotic, and viral transcripts.

TI  - The powdery mildew disease of rubber (<i>Oidium heveae</i>) is jointly controlled by the winter temperature and host phenology
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMETEOROLOGY
AB  - Rubber powdery mildew disease (Oidium heveae) is a serious threat to natural rubber production (Hevea brasiliensis) in some rubber developing regions of the world. Both phenological- and meteorological-related factors have been reported influencing the powdery mildew disease. However, few studies have investigated the effects of both phenological- and meteorological-related factors on the disease. The objective of this study is to quantify the contributions of phenological- and meteorological-related factors to affect the disease. We used the partial least squares (PLS) regression method to comprehensively quantify the effects of thirty-five phenological related factors and six meteorological factors on the infection level of powdery mildew of rubber trees over 9-year records (2003-2011). The relative contributions of significant factors were further investigated by the variation partition analysis. We found that the most influential variables were the mean temperature during winter and the duration of leaf development to maturation which explained 32 and 26% of the variations in the infection level. We found the controlling role of winter mean temperature, for the first time, on the infection level of powdery mildew. The controlling role of winter temperature may have directly increase the infection level when winter temperature is high and indirectly increase the infection level through prolonging the duration of leaf development to maturation, although the duration itself had smaller influences. We detected a warming trend of the winter temperatures from 2003 to 2011, which indicates that the infection level of powdery mildew will be increased if the winter warming continues.

TI  - Mosquito (Diptera: Culicidae) fauna in parks in greater Sao Paulo, Brazil
T2  - BIOTA NEOTROPICA
AB  - Municipal parks in the city of Sao Paulo, which are used for leisure purposes, contain remnants of the flora of the Atlantic Forest, as well as lakes and springs, and are home to mammals, birds and arthropods, some of which can be vectors of disease. The eastern side of the city has the largest population in Sao Paulo and twenty-four municipal parks. The aim of this study was to investigate Culicidae fauna in two parks on this side of the city and to determine which of the Culicidae species identified have the potential to act as bioindicators and vectors of human pathogens. Culicidae were collected monthly between March 2011 and February 2012 in Carmo Park and Chico Mendes Park with battery-powered aspirators, Shannon traps and CDC traps for adult mosquitoes, and larval dippers and suction samplers for immature mosquitoes. To confirm sample sufficiency, the EstimateS program was used to plot sample-based species accumulation curves and estimate total richness by the Jackknife 1 method. In all, 1,092 culicids from nine genera (Aedes, Anopheles, Coquillettidia, Culex, Limatus, Mansonia, Trichoprosopon, Toxorhynchites and Uranotaenia) and nineteen taxonomic units were collected in Carmo Park. Coquillettidia venezuelensis (Theobald 1912), Aedes scapularis (Rondani 1848) and Culex (Culex) spp. Linnaeus 1758 were the most abundant adults, and Culex (Melanoconion) spp. Theobald 1903 and Anopheles strodei Root 1926 the most abundant immature mosquitoes. In Chico Mendes Park 4,487 mosquitoes in six genera and eighteen taxonomic units were collected. Culex (Cux.) spp. and Ae. scapularis were the most abundant adults, and Ae. albopictus (Skuse 1984) the most abundant immature mosquitoes. The species accumulation curves in both parks were close to the asymptote, and the total richness estimate was close to the observed richness. Some culicid taxons are bioindicators of environmental conditions in the areas they inhabit. It is important to monitor native fauna in municipal parks in Sao Paulo as various species in this study were found to have vector competence and capacity to transmit pathogens, such as arboviruses.

TI  - American cutaneous leishmaniasis in Guyana, South America
T2  - ANNALS OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND PARASITOLOGY
AB  - The 185 patients who presented at the dermatology clinic of Georgetown Public Hospital, Guyana, between 1992 and 1998, with skin ulcers indicative of American cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL) were retrospectively reviewed. The laboratory-confirmed cases of ACL were identified and the corresponding data were analysed for risk factors such as age, gender, areas of residence and of possible exposure to the causative agent (Leishmania braziliensis guyanensis), ethnic origin, longevity of the ulcers, and treatment regimes prior to the definitive diagnosis.
   Eighty-one (43%) of the 185 subjects were confirmed to be infected with Le. b. guyanensis. Although 53 (66%) of the cases lived in or close to the capital city, Georgetown, most of the cases had travelled to (and probably been infected in) region X in the interior of Guyana (32%) or regions VII (23%), VIII (23%), IX (11%), VI (5%), I (3%) or III (3%), usually because they were involved in the mining (41%) or lumber (21%) industries, the army or hunting. Almost all (95%) of the cases were male and most (58%) were aged 20-39 years. In general, the cases had had their skin lesions for many days before presenting for treatment: 46% for 1-5 weeks and 3% for > 6 months. Prior to presentation at the clinic, many of the cases had attempted to cure themselves, using local herbal remedies (37%), antibiotics and antifungal remedies (39%), other creams (5%), household chemicals (9%) or miscellaneous remedies such as lead salts (especially lead sulphate) and battery acid, all without success.
   Recommendations are made for an epidemiological study of active ACL among forest workers, eco-tourists and residents of high-risk areas. Diagnostic centres need to be sited in the regions most at-risk, particularly in or near environments in which the main vectors-sandflies such as Lutzomyia umbratilis, Lu. anduzei and Lu. whitmani-are known to be prevalent.

TI  - DRASTIC REDUCTION OF POPULATIONS OF SIMULIUM-SIRBANUM (DIPTERA, SIMULIIDAE) IN CENTRAL SIERRA-LEONE AFTER 5 YEARS OF LARVICIDING OPERATIONS BY THE ONCHOCERCIASIS CONTROL PROGRAM
T2  - ANNALS OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND PARASITOLOGY
AB  - The major vectors of the blinding form of human onchocerciasis in West Africa are two blackfly species, Simulium sirbanum and Simulium damnosum s.s. (Diptera: Simuliidae), identified at the adult stage as the 'savanna group' of the Simulium damnosum complex. In 1988, in the central part of Sierra Leone, the average daily biting rate (females/man/day) by savanna blackflies (mostly S. sirbanum) during the peak of the dry season (April-May) was 59.9, making up 69.1% of total captures on average. There was evidence of a strong long-range immigration of adult females of S. sirbanum through eastern Guinea in the dry season, with a reverse movement towards Guinea in the rainy season. Therefore, in 1989, the World Health Organization's Onchocerciasis Control Programme (OCP) extended its vector control operations from central West Africa to rivers of central and northern Sierra Leone, and to rivers of eastern Guinea. Four years of efficient larviciding drastically reduced adult populations of S. sirbanum in Sierra Leone. In the peak of the dry seasons of 1993 and 1994, the average biting rate by savanna blackflies in central Sierra Leone had dropped to 1.0, making up only 4.3% of total captures on average. Yearly biting rates by S. sirbanum in central Sierra Leone were therefore reduced to 2% of their pre-intervention levels. Based on larval samples, the S. sirbanum has been replaced by two forest species, S. leonense in the south and S. squamosum in the north.
   Since 1992, it has been possible to calculate accurate transmission rates for blinding onchocerciasis, based on DNA-probe identifications. From 1993, the risk of transmission has not only been reduced by vector control but also by mass distribution of ivermectin to rural communities. In terms of control strategy, the authors conclude that larviciding operations could be alleviated in central Sierra Leone without increasing the risk of blinding onchocerciasis transmission, as long as the migration of S. sirbanum through eastern Guinea and northern Sierra Leone is prevented.

TI  - THE EFFECTS OF A RUST INFECTION ON FITNESS COMPONENTS IN A NATURAL-POPULATION OF TOLUMNIA-VARIEGATA (ORCHIDACEAE)
T2  - OECOLOGIA
AB  - The effects of a rust infection (Sphenosphora saphena, Basidiomycetes) on several fitness components of the orchid Tolumnia (Oncidium) variegata were quantified in a subtropical moist forest of Puerto Rico. Infected and uninfected plants of two size categories were observed and manipulated by increasing natural levels of fruit production to determine the effects of infection on short and long-term sexual reproduction, subsequent vegetative and reproductive growth, and mortality. Under artificially high levels of fruit production, infection had no effect on short or long-term reproduction through male or female function except for a modest decline in seed viability in small plants. Under natural levels of fruit production, infection was only related to a reduction in the number of leaves per shoot. At artificially high levels of fruit production, infection reduced leaf length, leaf width, and the number of live shoots. Survival was not associated with rust occurrence. The rust appears to have minor ecological impact on this orchid population.

TI  - Microhabitat use by species of the genera <i>Bothrops</i> and <i>Crotalus</i> (Viperidae) in semi-extensive captivity
T2  - JOURNAL OF VENOMOUS ANIMALS AND TOXINS INCLUDING TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Many factors influence microhabitat including climate and the occurrence of predators, prey and suitable shelters. The influence of predators in a semi-extensive breeding system is minimized due to frequent monitoring of the area. This situation enables the independent analysis of such other variables as refuges and temperature. Some specimens of the Viperidae family are kept in a semi-extensive breeding system at the Butantan Institute for display and study. These animals are widely distributed in the Atlantic Forest and Cerrado, two biomes with distinct climatic characteristics. We compared the daily activity pattern and microhabitat use of the species Bothrops jararaca and Crotalus durissus terrificus. Our main questions were whether rattlesnakes and lancehead snakes respond to habitat selection differently in similar climatic conditions and if they choose similar microhabitats. Species of the genus Bothrops were frequently found under shelters regardless of the time of day. On the other hand, snakes of the genus Crotalus were frequently found sheltered during the early morning, then migrated to sunnier areas and returned to shelters in late afternoon.

TI  - <i>Brevipalpus</i>-associated viruses in the central Amazon Basin
T2  - TROPICAL PLANT PATHOLOGY
AB  - A survey of Brevipalpus-transmitted plant viruses (BTrV) was carried out in the cities of Manaus and Presidente Figueiredo, and in the oil exploratory base of Urucu, Amazonas State, Central Amazon Basin, Brazil. The main characteristics considered during the survey were the occurrence of localized symptoms (chlorotic or brown spots, ringspots, green spots in senescent leaves) similar to those previously described for BTrV and infestation by Brevipalpus Mites. For the evaluation of the infection by putative BTrV, small fragments of the leaf lesions were fixed in loco and later processed for ultrastructural electron microscopy at Piracicaba, SP. Thirteen plant hosts of presumed BTrV were found. Three of them probably represent previously described BTrV infecting Hibiscus rosa sinensis, H. syriacus and Clerodendrum x speciosum. For the first time we report cases of infection by putative BTrV of nuclear type in chlorotic spot in Piper callosum (Piperaceae), chlorotic ringspot in Monstera deliciosa (Araceae), chlorotic spot in Ruellia charfacea (Acanthaceae), chlorotic spot in Bidens sp. (Asteraceae), green spot in Allamanda chatartica (Apocynaceae), chlorotic spot in Gardenia sp. (Rubiaceae), chlorotic ringspot and green spot in Mussaenda erythrophylla. (Rubiaceae) and of cytoplasmic type in Clerodendrum speciosissimum (Lamiaceaae) and ringspots in Arundina graminifolia (Orchidaceae). All these plants were infested by Brevipalpu. phoenicis.

TI  - Epizootiology and Molecular Identification of Trypanosome Species in Livestock Ruminants in the Gambia
T2  - ACTA PARASITOLOGICA
AB  - Introduction African Animal Trypanosomiasis (AAT) or nagana in animals, is caused by the blood-borne parasitic protozoa called trypanosomes, and is potentially fatal. It is estimated that Africa loses $4-5 billion annually due to the death of livestock to nagana in the tsetse belt. Purpose Although The Gambia lies within this belt, there is scanty data regarding the epizootiology of nagana in The Gambia. Here, records of reported cases of nagana for the period 2010-2019 at the International Trypanotolerance Centre (ITC) in The Gambia were analyzed retrospectively. Methods For insights into the current prevalence of AAT, blood samples of 384 cattle, 42 goats, and 59 sheep from the Central River Region (CRR) and Lower River Region (LRR) were analyzed microscopically for parasite identification. Furthermore, trypanosomes were characterized by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using a panel of primers that identify trypanosomes to the level of the species and subspecies by targeting a portion of the internally transcribed spacer-one (ITS-1) of the ribosomal RNA. Results The retrospective study indicates that Trypanosoma vivax (66%) and T. congolense (33.4%) were the predominant species. Based on the archive records of ITC, the villages Touba, Misera, and Sambel Kunda all in the CRR of the Gambia are the most burdened with AAT. Microscopic examination of blood samples from cattle showed a prevalence of 1.56%, whereas the PCR-based analysis gave a higher prevalence of 12.5%. The molecular analysis revealed the presence of T. vivax (3.65%), T. congolense kilifi (2.6%), T. b. brucei (1.3%), T. congolense savannah/forest (0.52%), T. b. gambiense (0.52%). Interestingly, 4.43% of mixed infections i.e. multiple trypanosome species in individual animals were recorded. In 18% of the mixed infection cases, T. godfreyi, T. simiae were coinfecting cattle alongside T. congolense. The molecular identification including the phylogenetic analysis implicated T. congolense as the most predominant trypanosome species infecting animals in The Gambia. Conclusion The incidence of nagana in The Gambia is documented and the prevalent trypanosomes identified to be T. vivax, different types of T. congolense, and T. brucei including the gambiense subspecie. Finally, nagana is less profound in sheep and goats compared to cattle, with seasonal and regional variations playing a significant role in the disease dynamics.

TI  - Buzziness as usual? Questioning the global pollination crisis
T2  - TRENDS IN ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION
AB  - Concerns have been raised that invertebrate pollinators of crops and wild plants are in decline as a result of modern agricultural practices, habitat degradation, and introduced pests and diseases. This has led to demands for a response by land managers, conservationists and political decision makers to the impending 'global pollinator crisis'. In questioning this crisis, it becomes apparent that perceptions of a pollinator crisis are driven mainly by reported declines of crop-pollinating honeybees in North America, and bumblebees and butterflies in Europe, whereas native pollinator communities elsewhere show mixed responses to environmental change. Additionally, few staple food crops depend on pollinator services, and most crops that do are grown at small scales in diversified agro-ecosystems that are likely to support healthy pollinator communities, or in highly managed systems that are largely independent of wild pollinators. Consequently, justifying conservation action on the basis of deteriorating pollinator services might be misplaced. Nevertheless, existing initiatives to monitor pollinators are well founded, given the uncertainty about the dynamics of pollinator populations.

TI  - Delayed diagnosis of malaria in a dengue endemic area in the Brazilian extra-Amazon: recent experience of a malaria surveillance unit in State of Rio de Janeiro
T2  - REVISTA DA SOCIEDADE BRASILEIRA DE MEDICINA TROPICAL
AB  - Introduction: The mortality of malaria in the extra-Amazon region is about 80 times higher than in the Amazon region, where malaria is concentrated (99.8% of cases). In areas of dengue transmission, delay in the diagnosis and treatment of malaria in patients with fever who reside in areas of malaria transmission can be due to the confusion between the clinical diagnoses of both diseases by non-specialist doctors, among other factors. This work presents some of the consequences of delayed diagnosis in three patients with malaria by Plasmodium falciparum, P. malariae and P. vivax, who, after following the usual route for Dengue treatment, sought our institution, where they were correctly diagnosed and adequately treated. Methods: Description of three cases of malaria with delayed diagnosed malaria referred to the Outpatient Clinic for Acute Febrile Diseases, IPEC/FIOCRUZ-RJ, between 2007 and 2008. Results: A Brazilian from Mozambique, primo-infected with P. falciparum was diagnosed with malaria six days after the onset of fever and died of cerebral malaria and shock. Another patient with P. malariae malaria presented a severe and prolonged course, but was cured after specific treatment. A third patient, with delayed diagnosis of P. vivax malaria, acquired it in the Atlantic Forest region in the state of Rio. Conclusions: Health professionals from non-endemic areas for malaria should be trained to optimize the surveillance and early treatment of malaria and prevent morbid and fatal outcomes. An investigation of outbreaks of autochthonous malaria in the State of Rio de Janeiro is suggested.

TI  - Prediction of malaria using deep learning models: A case study on city clusters in the state of Amazonas, Brazil, from 2003 to 2018
T2  - REVISTA DA SOCIEDADE BRASILEIRA DE MEDICINA TROPICAL
AB  - Background: Malaria is curable. Nonetheless, over 229 million cases of malaria were recorded in 2019, along with 409,000 deaths. Although over 42 million Brazilians are at risk of contracting malaria, 99% percent of all malaria cases in Brazil are located in or around the Amazon rainforest. Despite declining cases and deaths, malaria remains a major public health issue in Brazil. Accurate spatiotemporal prediction of malaria propagation may enable improved resource allocation to support efforts to eradicate the disease.
   Methods: In response to calls for novel research on malaria elimination strategies that suit local conditions, in this study, we propose machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models to predict the probability of malaria cases in the state of Amazonas. Using a dataset of approximately 6 million records (January 2003 to December 2018), we applied k-means clustering to group cities based on their similarity of malaria incidence. We evaluated random forest, long-short term memory (LSTM) and dated recurrent unit (GRU) models and compared their performance.
   Results: The LSTM architecture achieved better performance in clusters with less variability in the number of cases, whereas the GRU presents better results in clusters with high variability. Although Diebold-Mariano testing suggested that both the LSTM and GRU performed comparably, GRU can be trained significantly faster, which could prove advantageous in practice.
   Conclusions: All models showed satisfactory accuracy and strong performance in predicting new cases of malaria, and each could serve as a supplemental tool to support regional policies and strategies.

TI  - The dynamic of asymptomatic <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> infections following mass drug administrations with dihydroarteminisin-piperaquine plus a single low dose of primaquine in Savannakhet Province, Laos
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
AB  - BackgroundThe increase in multidrug resistant Plasmodium falciparum infections threatens the malaria elimination goals in countries within the Greater Mekong Sub-region. A multi-pronged approach assuring access to basic malaria control measures, including insecticide-treated bed nets and early diagnosis and treatment was followed by mass drug administrations (MDA) in southern Savannakhet Province, Laos. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of mass drug administrations as well as their effects on the dynamic of asymptomatic P. falciparum infections in 4 malaria endemic villages.MethodsTwo villages were randomized to early MDA consisting of 3 rounds of a 3-day course of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine with a single low dose of primaquine. In the other 2 villages MDA was deferred by 1year. A total of 1036 residents were enrolled in early MDA villages and 883 in control villages (deferred-MDA). Tri-monthly parasitaemia surveys using uPCR were conducted for a year in the 4 villages.ResultsEighty-four percent (872/1036) of the residents participated in the MDAs, of whom 90% (781/872) completed 3 rounds of MDA (9 doses). In intervention villages, the prevalence of asymptomatic P. falciparum infections decreased by 85% after MDA from 4.8% (95% CI 3.4-6.4) at baseline (month 0 or M0) to 0.7% (95% CI 0.3-1.6) at month 12. In control villages there was a decrease of 33% in P. falciparum prevalence between M0: 17.5% (95% CI 15.9-20.3) and M12: 11.6% (95% CI 9.3-14.2). In bivariate and multivariate analyses P. falciparum infections were significantly reduced with early MDA (adjusted incidence rate ratios (AIRR): 0.08, CI 0.01-0.091) and completion of 3 MDA rounds (AIRR: 0.06; CI 0.01-0.66). A quarter of participants (226/872) reported adverse events of which 99% were mild.ConclusionThe study found a significant reduction in P. falciparum prevalence and incidence following MDA. MDA was safe, well tolerated, feasible, and achieved high population coverage and adherence. MDAs must be integrated in multi-pronged approaches such as vector control and preventive measures with a focus on specific risk groups such as mobile, migrant population and forest goers for a sustained period to eliminate the remaining parasite reservoirs.Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01872702

TI  - Identification of high-risk habitats of Oncomelania hupensis, the intermediate host of schistosoma japonium in the Poyang Lake region, China: A spatial and ecological analysis
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background Identifying and eliminating snail habitats is the key measure for schistosomiasis control, critical for the nationwide strategy of eliminating schistosomiasis in China. Here, our aim was to construct a new analytical framework to predict high-risk snail habitats based on a large sample field survey for Oncomelania hupensis, providing guidance for schistosomiasis control and prevention.
   Methodology/Principal findings Ten ecological models were constructed based on the occurrence data of Oncomelania hupensis and a range of variables in the Poyang Lake region of China, including four presence-only models (Maximum Entropy Models, Genetic Algorithm for rule-set Production, Bioclim and Domain) and six presence-absence models (Generalized Linear Models, Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines, Flexible Discriminant Analysis, as well as machine algorithmic models-Random Forest, Classification Tree Analysis, Generalized Boosted Model), to predict high-risk snail habitats. Based on overall predictive performance, we found Presence-absence models outperformed the presence-only models and the models based on machine learning algorithms of classification trees showed the highest accuracy. The highest risk was located in the watershed of the River Fu in Yugan County, as well as the watershed of the River Gan and the River Xiu in Xingzi County, covering an area of 52.3 km(2). The other high-risk areas for both snail habitats and schistosomiasis were mainly concentrated at the confluence of Poyang Lake and its five main tributaries.
   Conclusions/Significance This study developed a new distribution map of snail habitats in the Poyang Lake region, and demonstrated the critical role of ecological models in risk assessment to directing local field investigation of Oncomelania hupensis. Moreover, this study could also contribute to the development of effective strategies to prevent further spread of schistosomiasis from endemic areas to non-endemic areas.
   Author summary Oncomelania hupensis is the sole intermediate host of Schistosoma japonicum and it is critical for the long-term sustainable control and elimination of schistosomiasis. We suggest a new analytical framework to predict high-risk snail habitats based on ecological models. Their predictive performance were compared via three indices (receiver-operating characteristic [ROC] curve, Kappa value and calibrating plot) and further they were classified into three grades with different discrimination ability. The four best models were chosen and combined to identify snail habitats, facilitating classification of the snail habitats in the Poyang Lake region into four risk grades, which should be prioritized for interruption of the snail life cycle, with control intensity and scope dependent on the available health resources.

TI  - Anophelines of Santa Catarina (Diptera: Culicidae), Brazil
T2  - REVISTA DA SOCIEDADE BRASILEIRA DE MEDICINA TROPICAL
AB  - Introduction: The Amazon region of Brazil is endemic for malaria. In the State of Santa Catarina, malaria was eliminated in the 1980s. Since then, a few sporadic isolated autochthonous cases have occurred. However, because malaria vectors are present within Brazilian territory and extensive endemic areas exist in this country, along with the great mobility of people in tourist areas of Santa Catarina, there is the likelihood of reintroduction of the disease. Methods: The following data were used: the database of the Entomology Group of the National Health Foundation, Santa Catarina (ACCES, 1997-2000); the epidemiological surveillance information system of the Health Surveillance Department (Malaria/SC); and the notifiable disease information system (SINAN/SC). These data were transferred to and analyzed in the Microsoft Office Excel 2007 software. Results: Collections were carried out in 48 municipalities and 159 localities, and 12,310 culicids, 11,546 anophelines (93.7%) and 764 others (6.2%) were identified. Three subgenera and 13 species of anophelines were identified. Conclusions: Given that in the municipalities investigated, important vectors such as Anopheles cruzii and Anopheles albitasis were found to be present, with movements of infected individuals from endemic areas, these areas can be considered to be receptive and vulnerable to malaria. These species are suspected of being responsible for malaria transmission in this region, especially in the municipalities of Gaspar, Indaial and Rodeio.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ZOO AND WILDLIFE MEDICINE
AB  - Francisella noatunensis is an emerging pathogen of fish that has been isolated from several cultured species worldwide. Here presented is a case involving several hundred marine grunts that were caught near the Florida Keys for display in public aquaria. These fish were maintained in a recirculating system where they began to experience mortalities approximately two weeks post-stocking. Postmortem examination revealed disseminated systemic granulomatous disease most severely affecting spleen and kidney. Splenic and renal tissue homogenates inoculated in modified Thayer Martin agar media yielded colonies consistent with F. noatunensis 4 days post inoculation. Bacterial colonies and tissues were confirmed positive after real-time PCR amplification of the intracellular growth loci gene (iglC) specific for F. noatunensis subspecies orientalis. Consequently, multiple novel host species for this pathogen were identified, including the French grunt (Haemulon flavolineatum) and the Caesar grunt (Haemulon carbonarium).

TI  - EDIBLE INSECTS - SAFE FOOD FOR HUMANS AND LIVESTOCK
T2  - ECOLOGICAL AND ECONOMIC SIGNIFICANCE OF FAUNA OF SERBIA
CP  - Scientific Meeting on Ecological and Economic Significance of Fauna of Serbia
AB  - This paper describes the contribution of insects to food security and survey future prospects for raising insects at a commercial scale to improve food and feed production, diversify diets, and support livelihoods in both developing and developed countries. It indicates some traditional and potential uses of insects for direct human consumption and the opportunities for and constraints to farming them for food and feed.
   The concept of sustainable diets, with biodiversity and at its core, has recently received renewed attention as the world struggles with many natural and man-made disasters. Sustainable diets are those diets with low environmental impacts which contribute to food and nutrition security and to healthy life for present and future generations. Sustainable diets are protective and respectful of biodiversity and ecosystems, culturally acceptable, accessible, economically fair and affordable; nutritionally adequate, safe and healthy; while optimizing natural and human resources [222]. Edible insects have always been a part of human diets. Although the majority of consumed insects are gathered in forest habitats, mass-rearing systems are being developed in many countries. Insects offer a significant opportunity to merge traditional knowledge and modern science to improve human food security worldwide. However, the urbanization has led to new human bahaviour that is far from natural resources and distant to the wild environment. Additionally, in some societies there is a degree of distaste for inscts consumption that further developed a standstill of the grasshopers in the Nile vally (Amar, 2003). Although the majority of edible insects are gathered from forest habitats, innovation in mass-rearing systems has begun in many countries. Insects offer a significant opportunity to merge traditional knowledge and modern science in both developed and developing countries. Edible insects as food fit comfortably within this environmentally sound scenario and, by extension, ought to be considered prime candidates as both food staples and supplements, as well as more generally for their role in sustainable diets.
   Sustainability of food and agriculture activities upon which 2.4 billion people depend for livelihoods was considered a key driver in the transition towards a green economy, due to its dual positive impact on ecosystem services and poverty alleviation [222, 229].
   Recent studies confirm that the insects are potentially an important energy efficient source of protein for humans, either through a direct consumption or as food supplements for stock. The high protein content is an indication that the insects can be of value in man and animal ration and can eventually replace higher animal protein usually absent in the diet of rural dwellers in developing countries [87]. The protein content varies by species of insects, but generally is of a good quality and high digestibility [48]. Analyses showed that in egg, larva, pupa and adult stages, the raw protein content is generally 15-81% / dry basis.
   With a daily growing world population, there are now more than 3.7 billion people suffering from malnutrition, mainly due to lack of protein and energy from food. Associated with the declining availability of land, water and energy resources per capita [35], we need to conserve and manage these resources to produce more food. Animal husbandry competes for these vital resources, as the land is occupied by the production of feed and cannot be used to produce food for humans [18]. Livestock production is very expensive because it requires a large input of water, grain and fodder as well as human effort and energy from fossil resources [35]. Utilization of insects as a protein source could benefit insect conservation through habitat protection [18]. Insects are essential agents feeding on organic matter in nature, and they efficiently exploit all organic sources. It is also important that insects are able to recycle organic waste and provide nutrients for farm animals [1, 179, 191]. Hence, insects could be used as efficient biotransformers to convert abundant, low cost organic wastes into animal biomass rich in proteins and suitable for use in animal nutrition. In a world as it is today, insects can contribute to human nutrition. Raising insects using waste biomass is already being implemented and managed today, with minimal infrastructure. Furthermore, insect culture requires little areas. Many of the edible insect species do not compete with human beings for food resources. The energetic cost of collecting edible insects is lower than that for vertebrates. Hence, insects may efficiently provide the necessary energy for the vital functions of our organism. Some species of edible insects have mostly the polyunsaturated fat type, as they feed on vegetables with largely unsaturated fats [1].
   Mostly, the fat content of edible insects is between 10-50%. The fat content of insects depends on many factors such as species, reproductive stages, season, age (life stage), or sex, habitat and diet. For example, the fat content is higher in the larva and pupa stages; at the adult stage, the fat content is relatively lower. Female insects contain more fat than male insects. As a general statement it could be said that insects are not inferior to other sources of protein such as fish, chicken or beef.
   Insects can partly replace the increasingly expensive protein ingredients of compound feeds in the livestock, poultry and aquaculture industries. Grains now used as livestock feed, which often comprise half the cost of meat production, could then be used for human consumption [182].
   In 2011, combined world feed production was estimated at 870 million tonnes, with revenue from global commercial feed manufacturing generating approximately US$350 billion globally. FAO estimates that production will have to increase by 70 percent to be able to feed the world in 2050, with meat outputs (poultry, pork and beef) expected to double [19].
   A major constraint to further development are the prohibitive costs of feed, including meat meal, fishmeal and soybean meal, which represent 60-70 percent of production costs. Another problem is manure disposal, which is becoming a serious environmental problem; large amounts of manure to be stockpiled in open-air, swarming with flies and potential human health hazards.
   It is striking to realize that the agricultural sector is the leading cause of human-induced climate change. Roughly one-third of all greenhouse gas emissions are due to agriculture, if we include the carbon dioxide emissions from deforestation (mainly to clear land for farming and pasture), energy use in agriculture (including the production of chemical fertilizers), methane released by ruminant livestock and rice paddies, and nitrous oxide released by the heavy use of nitrogen fertilizers. We will need new technologies, and new patterns of food consumption, based on healthier and more sustainable diets [20].
   There is a wealth of traditional and cultural knowledge on the uses of edible insects as food in tropical countries, yet production is largely concentrated in household and small-scale operations. In temperate countries, processing technology is virtually nonexistent because edible insects are not recognized food and feed sources. If insects are to become a useful and profitable raw material in the food and feed industries, large quantities of quality insects will need to be produced on a continuous basis. This requires both introducing new farming and processing methods, which remains a challenge for the development of the sector. However, major requirements are rearing practices in tropical countries should employ local species because they pose virtually no risk to the environment, there is no need for climate control, and such local species are likely to be more culturally accepted. Selection criteria should involve ease of rearing, taste, colour and whether they can be used as feed. In temperate zones, cosmopolitan species like the house cricket (Acheta domesticus) should be used, or those that do not pose environmental risks. Species destined for mass production, moreover should possess certain characteristics, including a high intrinsic rate of increase; a short development cycle; high survival of immatures and high oviposition rate; a high potential of biomass increase per day (i.e. weight gain per day); a high conversion rate (kg biomass gain per kg feedstock); the ability to live in high densities (kg biomass per m(2)); and low vulnerability to disease (high resistance). Good candidates were considered to be the black soldier fly (Hermetia illuscens) for feed and the yellow mealworm (Tenebrio molitor) for both food and feed [1]. Additionally, insect animal feed developed from manure and related organic waste streams raises bacteriological, mycological and toxicological concerns.
   The polarity of views surrounding the practice of entomophagy requires tailor-made communication approaches. In parts of the world where entomophagy is well established, such as the tropics, communication strategies need to promote and preserve edible insects as valuable sources of nutrition in order to counter the growing westernization of diets. In areas where food security is fragile, edible insects need to be promoted as key foods and feeds for nutritional, cultural and economic reasons. However, Western societies still largely averse to the practice of eating insects will require tailored strategies that address the disgust factor and break down common myths surrounding the practice. In general, education is the key instrument for creating public awareness of the potential roles of insects and in influencing consumer choices towards a more balanced and favourable outlook on insects as food and feed.
   Research on the contribution of edible insects to nutrition and economy, on insect species' biology and ecology has to be implemented in projects on sustainable agriculture/food. Additionally, addressing the entomophagy disgust factor in Western societies might depend largely on the ability to involve the entire educational community. The past decade, however, has seen a slow but steady rise in food insects in formal education. As of the end of 2011, 46 percent of the universities in the United States - the main food and agricultural universities in the country - had at least one course in their curricula that featured food insects. In the Netherlands, the Laboratory of Entomology at Wageningen University offers "insects and society" courses including entomophagy. The Laboratory has an outstanding reputation in multitrophic interactions, biological control, malaria vector research and entomophagy, and draws worldwide attention to the issue of entomophagy. The objective is to explore the potential sustainable production of edible insects and insect-derived products, particularly proteins, as a reliable and high-quality food source with a lower negative environmental impact than conventional meat production. Governmental bodies have important roles to play in promoting insects as food and feed. In particular, the development of this new sector as a viable (and environmentally friendly) alternative to the conventional food and feed. Experts from international agencies, scientific institutions and private-sector stakeholders, together with staff from relevant FAO sectors created webportal on edible insects since 2010. It provides basic information on the use and potential of edible insects as well as relevant weblinks, such as to the proceedings of the conferences, information on the Expert Consultation Meetings and other relevant technical information, videos and media coverage. The address of the webportal is www.fao.org/forestry/edibleinsects.
   In developed countries, insect rering occurs mainly on family-operated farms. Presently, there are only a few large-scale industrial plans that rear insects. The most common insects that were collected or reared within Europe are: Acheta domesticus, Bombyx mori, Galleria mellonella, Gryllus assimillis, Hermetia illucens, Locusta migratoria, Musca domestica, Schistocerca gregaria, T. molitor and Zophobas atratus [225].
   The H. illucens reperesent the species of good rearing potential because it substantially reduce biowaste and house fly breeding and additionally can be used as animal food [226]. Except this invasive species, few native species as grass hopers, crickets, and mealworms, are significant source of proteins. A number of species in Serbia are highly abundant and pose a molesting problem. This is a case with flood water mosquitoes, insects of Chironomidae family and house flies. Resarch on their mass production as potential food source for house pets, animals or as a part of organic fertilazers could support a small scale of organic farming production in rural regions. Additionally, it should not be forgotten that some of the species have important impact in waste decomposition, hence create additional value to the family-operated farms. Insect rearing is easy, does not require much of technical knowledge nor high investments, therefore accessable to a majority of rural inhabitants of a law income.
   The production and consumption of insects should also be analysed from the viewpoint of their potential impact on health and biodiversity and the potential environmental hazards associated with insect production and release, including the accidental release of insect species not indigenous to the area of production.
   People, especially in areas where insects were not consumed for a long time, prefer incorporating insects into the food in a way they are not visible, so they accept only the idea that the insects have a nutritional value. This shows that people especially in North America and Europe can eat insects if they do not know what they are eating.These factors suggest that insect transformation will facilitate its consumption in the future. In practice, dried insects may be crushed or pulverized, and raw or boiled insects ground or mashed, making their insect form unrecognizable [9].
   Much work still needs to be done and many issues taken into account when elaborating normative frameworks and adjusting for insect-inclusive food laws. At the Expert FAO Meeting in 2012, therefore, a working group developed the following proposals for elaborating regulatory frameworks [59].
   Private and public standards may establish the basis of harmonized regulatory practices on the use of insects as food and feed. Legal frameworks should be developed to consolidate and set binding provisions and to ensure the implementation and enforcement of such provisions throughout the sector. It is necessary to promote the establishment of appropriate international and national standards and legal frameworks to facilitate the use of insects as food and feed and the development and formalization of the sector. It is also very important to take into consideration the potential effects of insect production and rearing on the environment, and the environmental and trade implications of the international movement of insects. Develop a clear and comprehensive legal framework at the (inter-) national level that can pave the way for production and trade in insect products for food and feed internationally.
   In the Western world, consumer acceptability will be determined, in large part, by pricing, perceived environmental benefits, and the development by the catering industry of tasty insect-derived protein products. Preservation and processing techniques are needed to increase shelf life, conserve quality and increase the acceptability of insect food products; processing procedures are also needed to transform insects into protein meal for animal/fish feedstock and for the extraction of insect proteins to be used as ingredients in the food industry.
   Considering the immense quantities of insect biomass needed to replace current protein-rich ingradients such as meal and oil from fish and soybeans, automated massrearing facilities that produce stable, reliable and safe products need to be developed. The challenge for this new industry will be to ensure the cost-effective, reliable production of an insect biomass of high and consistent quality. Regulatory frameworks need to be developed. The close collaboration of government, industry and academia will be essential for success.

TI  - Genetic diversity and population structure of <i>Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis</i> in the Peruvian jungle
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - BackgroundHuman cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis is highly prevalent in the Peruvian jungle, where it affects military forces deployed to fight against drug trafficking and civilian people that migrate from the highland to the lowland jungle for economic activities such as mining, agriculture, construction, and chestnut harvest.We explored the genetic diversity and population structure of 124 L. (V.) braziliensis isolates collected from the highland (Junin, Cusco, and Ayacucho) and lowland Peruvian jungle (Loreto, Ucayali, and Madre de Dios). All samples were genotyped using Multilocus Microsatellite Typing (MLMT) of ten highly polymorphic markers. Principal findingsHigh polymorphism and genetic diversity were found in Peruvian isolates of L. (V.) braziliensis. Most markers are not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium; this deviation is most likely caused by local inbreeding, as shown by the positive F-IS values. Linkage Disequilibrium in subpopulations was not strong, suggesting the reproduction was not strictly clonal. Likewise, for the first time, two genetic clusters of this parasite were determined, distributed in both areas of the Peruvian jungle, which suggested a possible recent colonization event of the highland jungle from the lowland jungle. ConclusionsL. (V.) braziliensis exhibits considerable genetic diversity with two different clusters in the Peruvian jungle. Migration analysis suggested a colonization event between geographical areas of distribution. Although no human migration was observed at the time of sampling, earlier displacement of humans, reservoirs, or vectors could have been responsible for the parasite spread in both regions.
   Author summaryL. (V.) braziliensis is widespread in the Peruvian jungle region. In this region, the departments of Cusco and Madre de Dios account for a large number of patients that get infected while working in the virgin forest. For the first time, we described ample genetic diversity among Peruvian L. (V.) braziliensis isolates with new alleles that were not previously reported in South America. In addition, two different genetic clusters or subpopulations of L. (V.) braziliensis in the Amazon Rainforest of Peru were described. This finding reveals the important distribution of parasite populations and suggests a possible colonization event between ecoregions of the highland and lowland Peruvian jungle independently of recent human migration.

TI  - Testing of Novel Dengue Virus 2 Vaccines in African Green Monkeys: Safety, Immunogenicity, and Efficacy
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - The immunogenicity and safety of three novel host-range vaccines containing deletions in the transmembrane domain of dengue virus serotype 2 (DV2) E glycoprotein were evaluated in African green monkeys. The shorter transmembrane domains are capable of functionally spanning an insect but not a mammalian cell membrane, resulting in production of viral mutants that have reduced infectivity in mammalian hosts but efficient growth in insect cells. Groups of four monkeys received one dose each of test vaccine candidate with no booster immunization. After immunization, levels of viremia produced by each vaccine were determined by infectious center assay. Vaccine recipient immune response to wild-type DV2 challenge was measured on Day 57 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and plaque reduction neutralization test. Two vaccines, DV2 Delta GVII and DV2G46013, generated neutralizing antibody in the range of 700-900 50% plaque reduction neutralization test units. All three vaccine strains decreased the length of viremia by at least two days. No safety concerns were identified.

TI  - Using Near-Infrared Spectroscopy and Stacked Regression for the Simultaneous Determination of Fresh Cattle and Poultry Manure Chemical Properties
T2  - CHEMOSENSORS
AB  - Excessive use of animal manure as fertilizers can lead to pollution through the introduction of nitrogen, phosphorus, and other mineral compounds to the environment. Wet chemical analytical methods are traditionally used to determine the precise chemical composition of manure to manage the application of animal waste to the soil. However, such methods require significant resources to carry out the processes. Affordable, rapid, and accurate methods of analyses of various chemical components present in animal manure, therefore, are valuable in managing soil and mitigating water pollution. In this study, a stacked regression ensemble approach using near-infrared spectroscopy was developed to simultaneously determine the amount of dry matter, total ammonium nitrogen, total nitrogen, phosphorus pentoxide, calcium oxide, magnesium oxide, and potassium oxide contents in both cattle and poultry manure collected from livestock production areas in France and Reunion Island. The performance of the stacked regression, an ensemble learning algorithm that is formed by collating the well-performing models for prediction was then compared with that of various other machine learning techniques, including support vector regression (linear, polynomial, and radial), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, ridge regression, elastic net, partial least squares, random forests, recursive partitioning and regression trees, and boosted trees. Results show that stack regression performed optimally well in predicting the seven abovementioned chemical constituents in the testing set and may provide an alternative to the traditional partial least squares method for a more accurate and simultaneous method in determining the chemical properties of animal manure.

TI  - Pesticide use in Indonesian vegetable farming and its determinants
T2  - MANAGEMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to analyse factors affecting the use of pesticides in intensive vegetable farming in Java, Indonesia. Evaluating such factors is expected to provide appropriate policies to reduce pesticides, and eventually, mitigates the adverse impacts of pesticides on human health and the environment.
   Design/methodology/approach Data were compiled from a farm survey of randomly selected 240 vegetable farmers in three regions of Java in 2014. A concept of economic threshold was employed to analyse the pesticide use determinants, which were estimated using econometric models.
   Findings Factors leading to the increase in the application of pesticides were the number of observed insect pests, prices of vegetables, use of local varieties, and use of mixed pesticides. Conversely, factors lowering the use of pesticides were the number of observed diseases, the cost of pesticides, and area planted to vegetables. The most important factor in influencing pesticide use was farmers' perception on the correct prediction of yield losses associated with pests and diseases.
   Research limitations/implications The sample for this research is somewhat low and the analysis was based on one-year data of the quantity of pesticides in a formulation.
   Practical implications The use of pesticides can be reduced by training farmers on crop protection practices, which provide correct information on pests and diseases. Policies related to the price of pesticides would be ineffective, as farmers still highly relied on pesticides. These findings will be useful for reducing the use of pesticides in intensive vegetable farming in Indonesia, and in tropical countries in general.
   Originality/value Pesticides have two opposite properties: to increase income on the one side and to cause devastation of life on the other side. Because pesticides are generally less selectively toxic than would be desired, non-targets including humans and the environment must be protected from contamination by these agrochemicals. This study found the most important determinants for reducing pesticide exposures in Indonesian intensive farming.

TI  - Nucleotide sequences of the 26S mRNAs of the viruses defining the Venezuelan equine encephalitis antigenic complex
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Genetic relationships among viruses defining the Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) virus antigenic complex were determined by analyzing the 3'-terminal 561 nucleotides of the nonstructural protein 4 gene and the entire 26S RNA region of the genome. New sequence information is reported for VEE 78V-3531 (VEE subtype-variety IF), Mucambo (IIIA), Tonate (IIIB), 71D-1252 (IIIC), Pixuna (IV), Cabassou (V), and AG80-663 (VI) viruses. The results reported here and by previous investigators largely support the current classification scheme of these viruses, while clearly identifying Everglades (II)asa subtype I virus. A genetic relationship between 78V-3531 (IF) and AG80-663 (VI) viruses contradicted previous serologic results. Mutations near the amino terminus of the E2 envelope proteins of Pixuna and AG80-663 viruses probably account for the previously reported low reactivity of the protective monoclonal antibody 1A2B-10 with these two viruses. Variations in the distribution of potential glycosylation sites in the E2 glycoprotein are discussed.

TI  - CERATOCYSTIS MANGINECANS AND NOT C. FIMBRIATA A THREAT TO PROPAGATED<i> ACACIA</i> SPP. IN SABAH, MALAYSIA
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL FOREST SCIENCE
AB  - Acacia mangium plantations in Sabah, Malaysia are seriously affected by a vascular wilt and canker disease caused by a species of Ceratocystis. A similar and devastating disease occurs in Indonesia and is caused by the fungal pathogen Ceratocystis manginecans. A closely related fungus, Ceratocystis fimbriata sensu stricto, is a common soil-borne pathogen of sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) in areas of Malaysia where A. mangium is grown. This study characterised the species causing wilting on A. mangium and compared it with the I. batatas pathogen using DNA sequence-based comparisons used artificial inoculations to assess the effect of the A. mangium pathogen on Acacia auriculiformis and Acacia crassicarpa and considered the ability of the sweet potato pathogen to cause disease on the three Acacia species. DNA sequence comparisons confirmed that isolates from diseased A. mangium were C. manginecans and those on sweet potato were C. fimbriata s.s. Ceratocystis manginecans was pathogenic on all Acacia spp., with A. mangium being most susceptible followed by =A. auriculiformis and A. crassicarpa. Pathogenicity tests showed that C. fimbriata s.s. from sweet potato is not able to cause disease on any of the three Acacia spp. considered. This study also confirmed that C. manginecans is the primary cause of ceratocystis canker and wilt disease in Sabah and that the sweet potato fungus, C. fimbriata s.s., poses no threat to propagated Acacia spp.

TI  - Distinct amino acid and lipid perturbations characterize acute versus chronic malaria
T2  - JCI INSIGHT
AB  - Chronic malaria is a major public health problem and significant challenge for disease eradication efforts. Despite its importance, the biological factors underpinning chronic malaria are not fully understood. Recent studies have shown that host metabolic state can influence malaria pathogenesis and transmission, but its role in chronicity is not known. Here, with the goal of identifying distinct modifications in the metabolite profiles of acute versus chronic malaria, metabolomics was performed on plasma from Plasmodium-infected humans and nonhuman primates with a range of parasitemias and clinical signs. In rhesus macaques infected with Plasmodium coatneyi, significant alterations in amines, camitines, and lipids were detected during a high parasitemic acute phase and many of these reverted to baseline levels once a low parasitemic chronic phase was established. Plasmodium gene expression. studied in parallel in the macaques, revealed transcriptional changes in amine, fatty acid, lipid and energy metabolism genes, as well as variant antigen genes. Furthermore, a common set of amines, carnitines, and lipids distinguished acute from chronic malaria in plasma from human Plasmodium falciparum cases. In summary, distinct host- parasite metabolic environments have been uncovered that characterize acute versus chronic malaria, providing insights into the underlying host-parasite biology of malaria disease progression.

TI  - OBSERVATIONS ON THE SUCCESSES AND FAILURES OF ACACIA PLANTATIONS IN SABAH AND SARAWAK AND THE WAY FORWARD
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL FOREST SCIENCE
AB  - Development of acacia plantations, mainly Acacia mangium, in Sabah and Sarawak has progressed well for over three decades. Despite some disease problems, A. mangium is still the preferred plantation species in Sabah and Sarawak as it is a fast-growing and flexible species that is able to grow on poor and degraded soils. However, reports of widespread mortality of young plantations due to root-rot diseases and Ceratocystis wilt, particularly in Indonesia, and fear of future failure of acacia plantations have caused alarm among plantation managers and growers, leading some quarters to call for a change of tree species for fast-growing plantations. This paper discusses two of the major diseases affecting Acacia species, particularly A. mangium, the successes and failures of acacia plantations in Sabah and Sarawak, and the way forward.

TI  - Risk factors associated with malaria infection in an urban setting
T2  - TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Incidence of malaria in urban settings is a growing concern in many regions of the world and individual risk factors need to be identified to appropriately adjust control strategies. We carried out a cross-sectional study in 1993/94 in an urban area of the largest port of the Pacific Coast of Colombia, where transmission has had an upward trend over the past 5 years. Prevalence of malaria infection was estimated in areas of the city with the highest incidence of disease, and the association between some characteristics of the population and the risk of malaria infection was assessed. Prevalence of malaria infection was 4.4% among the 1380 studied people and we found that it decreased with older age, and with knowledge of disease and preventive measures directed to elimination of breeding sites. In addition, the infection was positively associated with exposure to the forest (P < 0.05), although most of the cases (57/61, 93%) were likely to have been acquired in the urban area. We also found that individuals receiving antimalarial treatment in the previous month had around twice the risk of being infected as compared with those without treatment. In addition, our results suggest that use of bednets could not be a very effective protective measure in settings such as that of our study, and that environmental interventions may be needed to decrease the risk of infection.

TI  - MOSQUITO BIODIVERSITY PATTERNS AROUND URBAN ENVIRONMENTS IN SOUTH-CENTRAL OKINAWA ISLAND, JAPAN
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MOSQUITO CONTROL ASSOCIATION
AB  - Okinawa is the largest, most urbanized, and densely populated island in the Ryukyus Archipelago, where mosquito species diversity has been thoroughly studied. However, the south-central Okinawa mosquito fauna has been relatively poorly studied. Here, we present results from a mosquito faunal survey in urban environments of Nishihara city, south-central Okinawa. Mosquitoes were sampled biweekly, from April 2007 to March 2008, at 3 different environments: a forest preserve, an animal farm, and a water reservoir. We employed 4 mosquito collection methods: 1) oviposition traps; 2) light traps; 3) sweep nets; and 4) larval surveys of tree holes, leaf axils, and artificial water containers. We collected a total of 568 adults and 10,270 larvae belonging to 6 genera and 13 species, including 6 species of medical importance: Aedes albopictus, Armigeres subalbatus, Anopheles Hyrcanus group, Culex bitaeniorhynchus, Cx. quinquefasciatus, and Cx. tritaeniorhynchus. Mosquito species composition was similar to data from previous studies in Okinawa Island. The flattening of the species accumulation curve suggests that our diversity sampling was exhaustive with light and oviposition traps, as well as the coincidence between the species richness we found in the field and estimates from the Chao2 index, a theoretical estimator of species richness based on species abundance. This study highlights the importance of combining several sampling techniques to properly characterize regional mosquito fauna and to monitor changes in the presence of mosquito species.

TI  - Towards Integrated Air Pollution Monitoring and Health Impact Assessment Using Federated Learning: A Systematic Review
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Environmental issues such as environmental pollutions and climate change are the impacts of globalization and become debatable issues among academics and industry key players. One of the environmental issues which is air pollution has been catching attention among industrialists, researchers, and communities around the world. However, it has always neglected until the impacts on human health become worse, and at times, irreversible. Human exposure to air pollutant such as particulate matters, sulfur dioxide, ozone and carbon monoxide contributed to adverse health hazards which result in respiratory diseases, cardiorespiratory diseases, cancers, and worst, can lead to death. This has led to a spike increase of hospitalization and emergency department visits especially at areas with worse pollution cases that seriously impacting human life and health. To address this alarming issue, a predictive model of air pollution is crucial in assessing the impacts of health due to air pollution. It is also critical in predicting the air quality index when assessing the risk contributed by air pollutant exposure. Hence, this systemic review explores the existing studies on anticipating air quality impact to human health using the advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI). From the extensive review, we highlighted research gaps in this field that are worth to inquire. Our study proposes to develop an AI-based integrated environmental and health impact assessment system using federated learning. This is specifically aims to identify the association of health impact and pollution based on socio-economic activities and predict the Air Quality Index (AQI) for impact assessment. The output of the system will be utilized for hospitals and healthcare services management and planning. The proposed solution is expected to accommodate the needs of the critical and prioritization of sensitive group of publics during pollution seasons. Our finding will bring positive impacts to the society in terms of improved healthcare services quality, environmental and health sustainability. The findings are beneficial to local authorities either in healthcare or environmental monitoring institutions especially in the developing countries.

TI  - Birds and bats enhance yields in Afrotropical cacao agroforests only under high tree-level shade cover
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Central/West Africa is one of the most biodiverse regions on earth and one of the largest producers of cacao, producing about 68.4 % of the world's chocolate. Here, cacao pests and diseases can cause losses of $761 million annually. However, no studies from Africa have quantified the role of flying vertebrates as pest suppressors in cacao plantations. We used an exclusion experiment to prevent access of bats and birds to cacao trees for 12 months and quantified how their absence affected arthropod communities, herbivory, and cacao crop yield. Overall, important pests such as mealybugs and other hemipterans were more abundant in exclosures (9 and 1.6 times increase, respectively), despite potential multitrophic interactions with simultaneously increasing predatory arthropods such as spiders and mantis. Under heavy shade (90 %), cacao trees with flying vertebrate exclosures had 3.9 times fewer flowers and 3.2 times fewer large pods than control trees, corresponding to estimated losses on average of $478 ha(-1)y(-1). Under low tree-level shade cover (10 %) however, the opposite pattern was evident: exclosure trees had 5.2 times more flowers and 3.7 times more large pods than control trees, corresponding to estimated savings on average of $796 ha(-1)y(-1). We demonstrate that the enormous potential of African flying vertebrates as pest suppressors in cacao plantations is dependent on local shade tree management and only economically relevant above 50 % of shade. Despite higher productivity at low shade levels, our findings encourage African policymakers and farmers to adopt more high shade cacao agroforestry systems to maximize pest suppression services provided by bats and birds.

TI  - Detection of the mosquito-borne flaviviruses, West Nile, Dengue, Saint Louis Encephalitis, Ilheus, Bussuquara, and Yellow Fever in free-ranging black howlers (Alouatta caraya) of Northeastern Argentina
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Several medically important mosquito-borne flaviviruses have been detected in Argentina in recent years: Dengue (DENV), St. Louis encephalitis (SLEV), West Nile (WNV) and Yellow Fever (YFV) viruses. Evidence of Bussuquara virus (BSQV) and Ilheus virus (ILHV) activity were found, but they have not been associated with human disease. Non-human primates can act as important hosts in the natural cycle of flaviviruses and serological studies can lead to improved understanding of virus circulation dynamics and host susceptibility. From July-August 2010, we conducted serological and molecular surveys in free-ranging black howlers (Alouatta caraya) captured in northeastern Argentina. We used 90% plaque-reduction neutralization tests (PRNT90) to analyze 108 serum samples for antibodies to WNV, SLEV, YFV, DENV (serotypes 1 and 3), ILHV, and BSQV. Virus genome detection was performed using generic reverse transcription (RT)-nested PCR to identify flaviviruses in 51 antibody-negative animals. Seventy animals had antibodies for one or more flaviviruses for a total antibody prevalence of 64.8% (70/108). Monotypic (13/70, 19%) and heterotypic (27/70, 39%) patterns were differentiated. Specific neutralizing antibodies against WNV, SLEV, DENV-1, DENV-3, ILHV, and BSQV were found. Unexpectedly, the highest flavivirus antibody prevalence detected was to WNV with 9 (8.33%) monotypic responses. All samples tested by (RT)-nested PCR were negative for viral genome. This is the first detection of WNV-specific antibodies in black howlers from Argentina and the first report in free-ranging non-human primates from Latin-American countries. Given that no animals had specific neutralizing antibodies to YFV, our results suggest that the study population remains susceptible to YFV. Monitoring of these agents should be strengthened to detect the establishment of sylvatic cycles of flaviviruses in America and evaluate risks to wildlife and human health.

TI  - Food availability and annual migration of the straw-colored fruit bat (<i>Eidolon helvum</i>)
T2  - JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY
AB  - Animal migrations offer a unique opportunity for developing and testing hypotheses about the ecological requirements of different species and the tradeoffs that they make between conflicting life-history demands. There has been relatively little research into the causes and consequences of migrations by fruit bats, despite their potential significance for pollination and seed dispersal. We assessed the causes of one of the most spectacular migrations of fruit bats known: the annual influx of an estimated 5-10 million E. helvum into Kasanka National Park in Zambia. We tested several predictions based on the hypothesis that E. helvum migrates to exploit seasonal variations in food Supply opportunistically. Phenological data, feeding observations and monitoring of fruit bat movements provided the first quantitative evidence in support of the hypothesis that the migration of E. helvum in Zambia is driven by food supply. The E. helvum colony exhibited several surprising behaviors, including a tendency for migratory satellite colonies to aggregate, rather than to disperse, during the time of peak food production, and a tendency to fly well beyond the most immediate food sources when foraging. Alternative hypotheses to explain the E. helvum migration were not supported, but further research is needed to clarify the results of this preliminary study. Both the size of the colony and its potential for large-scale movements suggest that this bat may play an important economic and ecological role over a significant portion of sub-Saharan Africa. Information is still lacking about migration routes, food sources, habitat requirements and the role of migration in disease transmission between colonies of E. helvum.

TI  - The cellulolytic activity and symbiotic potential of dark septate endophytic fungus <i>Phialocephala fortinii</i> to promote non-mycorrhizal plants growth
T2  - 1ST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SUSTAINABLE TROPICAL LAND MANAGEMENT
CP  - 1st International Conference on Sustainable Tropical Land Management (ICSTLM)
AB  - The endophytic fungi have attracted much attention to investigating their ability to degrade cellulose and promote plant growth as double functional roles. The objective of this study was to investigate the cellulase activity and the ability of dark septate endophytic fungus (DSE) Phialocephala fortinii to promote non-mycorrhizal plants. This study consisted of carboxy-methylcellulose degradation activity of DSE isolates, cellulase activity, and the effect of cellulolytic DSE to promote non-mycorrhizal plants growth assays. The results showed P. fortinii III.Pi.I8 had the largest cellulolytic index than P. fortinii CKG.II.10.1 and P. eryngii for 7 days of incubation time. The cellulase activity pattern of all P. fortinii isolates was rather similar to P. eryngii for the incubation time of 7 to 35 days. Phialocephala fortinii III.Pi.I8, CKG.II.10.1, and CKG.I.11 increased the growth of Brassica oleracea var. capitata by 7.63, 92.5, and 47.7%, and Spinacia oleracea by 58.5, 283, and 303%, respectively, over to the control plant. Heavy colonization of P. fortinii occurred both in B. oleracea var. capitata and S. oleracea roots. This study proved that although P. fortinii has cellulase activity but did not cause disease symptoms in non-mycorrhizal plants so that it can potentially be multifunctional as cellulose decomposer and plant growth promoter.

TI  - Saving rainforests in the South Pacific: challenges in <i>ex situ</i> conservation
T2  - AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
AB  - Rainforests in the South Pacific hold a considerable amount of plant diversity, with rates of species endemism >80% in some countries. This diversity is rapidly disappearing under pressure from logging, clearing for agriculture or mining, introduced pests and diseases and other anthropogenic sources. Ex situ conservation techniques offer a means to limit the loss of plant diversity. Seed banking is considered the most efficient and cost effective of these techniques but is applicable only to seed capable of tolerating desiccation and cold storage. Data on the degree of tolerance of these conditions was lacking for more than half of the 1503 South Pacific rainforest genera examined for this review. Of the 710 genera for which data were available, the storage behaviour of 324 was based on an assessment of only one or two species, although 76% of those genera contained at least 10 species. Many of the unstudied or poorly studied genera are shared across several South Pacific nations, providing an excellent opportunity for collaboration on future ex situ research and conservation. Of the 386 genera for which three or more species have been studied, 343 have a very high proportion of species (>95% of those tested) that are suitable for seed banking. Seed banking could therefore provide a suitable means for preserving a large proportion of the rainforest flora before it becomes extinct in the wild. Alternatives for preserving species that are not suitable for seed banking are also discussed.

TI  - Loss of Glycosaminoglycan Receptor Binding after Mosquito Cell Passage Reduces Chikungunya Virus Infectivity
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-transmitted alphavirus that can cause fever and chronic arthritis in humans. CHIKV that is generated in mosquito or mammalian cells differs in glycosylation patterns of viral proteins, which may affect its replication and virulence. Herein, we compare replication, pathogenicity, and receptor binding of CHIKV generated in Vero cells (mammal) or C6/36 cells (mosquito) through a single passage. We demonstrate that mosquito cell-derived CHIKV (CHIKVmos) has slower replication than mammalian cell-derived CHIKV (CHIKVvero), when tested in both human and murine cell lines. Consistent with this, CHIKVmos infection in both cell lines produce less cytopathic effects and reduced antiviral responses. In addition, infection in mice show that CHIKVmos produces a lower level of viremia and less severe footpad swelling when compared with CHIKVvero. Interestingly, CHIKVmos has impaired ability to bind to glycosaminoglycan (GAG) receptors on mammalian cells. However, sequencing analysis shows that this impairment is not due to a mutation in the CHIKV E2 gene, which encodes for the viral receptor binding protein. More-over, CHIKVmos progenies can regain GAG receptor binding capability and can replicate similarly to CHIKVvero after a single passage in mammalian cells. Furthermore, CHIKVvero and CHIKVmos no longer differ in replication when N-glycosylation of viral proteins was inhibited by growing these viruses in the presence of tunicamycin. Collectively, these results suggest that N-glycosylation of viral proteins within mosquito cells can result in loss of GAG receptor binding capability of CHIKV and reduction of its infectivity in mammalian cells.

TI  - Potential hidden <i>Plasmodium vivax</i> malaria reservoirs from low parasitemia Duffy-negative Ethiopians: Molecular evidence
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - BackgroundThe interaction between the Plasmodium vivax Duffy-binding protein and the corresponding Duffy Antigen Receptor for Chemokines (DARC) is primarily responsible for the invasion of reticulocytes by P. vivax. The Duffy-negative host phenotype, highly prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa, is caused by a single point mutation in the GATA-1 transcription factor binding site of the DARC gene promoter. The aim of this study was to assess the Duffy status of patients with P. vivax infection from different study sites in Ethiopia. MethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted from February 2021 to September 2022 at five varying eco-epidemiological malaria endemic sites in Ethiopia. Outpatients who were diagnosed with P. vivax infection (pure and mixed P. vivax/P. falciparum) by microscopy and Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) were subjected to PCR genotyping at the DARC promoter. The associations between P. vivax infection, host genotypes and other factors were evaluated. ResultIn total, 361 patients with P. vivax infection were included in the study. Patients with pure P. vivax infections accounted for 89.8% (324/361), while the remaining 10.2% (37/361) had mixed P. vivax/P. falciparum infections. About 95.6% (345/361) of the participants were Duffy-positives (21.2% homozygous and 78.8%, heterozygous) and 4.4% (16/361) were Duffy-negatives. The mean asexual parasite density in homozygous and heterozygous Duffy-positives was 12,165 p/& mu;l (IQR25-75: 1,640-24,234 p/& mu;l) and11,655 p/& mu;l (IQR25-75: 1,676-14,065 p/& mu;l), respectively, significantly higher than that in Duffy-negatives (1,227p/& mu;l; IQR25-75: 539-1,732p/& mu;l). ConclusionThis study confirms that Duffy-negativity does not provide complete protection against P. vivax infection. The development of P. vivax-specific elimination strategies, including alternative antimalarial vaccines should be facilitated by a better understanding of the epidemiological landscape of vivax malaria in Africa. More importantly, low parasitemia associated with P. vivax infections in Duffy-negative patients may represent hidden reservoirs of transmission in Ethiopia.
   Author summaryPlasmodium vivax generally receives less attention than P. falciparum and was neglected in sub-Saharan Africa. However, the characteristics of P. vivax infection in Duffy-negative individuals, and the distribution of Duffy blood group in different eco-epidemiological zones and ethnic groups of Ethiopia are not well documented. Here, we determined the Duffy genotypes of P. vivax infected patients across broad regions of Ethiopia. It is clear that Duffy negative individuals in Ethiopia are not fully protected against P. vivax infection, and that these infections in Duffy negatives are often associated with low parasitemia. Our findings lend support to the notion that P. vivax may have developed a Duffy-independent erythrocyte invasion pathway and/or evolution in host immune responses.

TI  - Importance of household-level risk factors in explaining micro-epidemiology of asymptomatic malaria infections in Ratanakiri Province, Cambodia
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Heterogeneity in malaria risk is considered a challenge for malaria elimination. A cross-sectional study was conducted to describe and explain micro-epidemiological variation in Plasmodium infection prevalence at household and village level in three villages in Ratanakiri Province, Cambodia. A two-level logistic regression model with a random intercept fitted for each household was used to model the odds of Plasmodium infection, with sequential adjustment for individual-level then household-level risk factors. Individual-level risk factors for Plasmodium infection included hammock net use and frequency of evening outdoor farm gatherings in adults, and older age in children. Household-level risk factors included house wall material, crop types, and satellite dish and farm machine ownership. Individual-level risk factors did not explain differences in odds of Plasmodium infection between households or between villages. In contrast, once household-level risk factors were taken into account, there was no significant difference in odds of Plasmodium infection between households and between villages. This study shows the importance of ongoing indoor and peridomestic transmission in a region where forest workers and mobile populations have previously been the focus of attention. Interventions targeting malaria risk at household level should be further explored.

TI  - Knowledge, perceptions, and practices with respect to the prevention of dengue in a mid-Pacific coastal village of Costa Rica
T2  - REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL
AB  - Dengue fever is the fastest spreading, most prevalent and deadly arthropod-borne viral disease worldwide, present in over 125 countries. In 2013, Costa Rica is experiencing the highest number of Dengue infections since the virus's reintroduction to the country in 1993. This study evaluated the Dengue-related knowledge of 320 community members, and polled opinions on how to better educate and mobilize the community on Dengue prevention in Quebrada Ganado, Costa Rica during March-May, 2013. In addition, property inspections were used to find relationships between knowledge or opinions and presence of Aedes breeding sites. Results showed that while citizens knew the virus is transmitted by mosquitoes that reproduce near water, they lacked knowledge on Aedes habits and confused it with other mosquitoes. Eighty-one percent of respondents assumed some responsibility for dengue prevention. Suggestions for improved education included consistent and continual information on the risks and dangers dengue poses to an individual. Characteristics relating to households with more positive breeding sites were: lower education level, higher prevalence of dengue infections in the household, lesser knowledge of dengue symptoms, a lower rating on the dangers of dengue and a lower rating on the importance of preventative actions. While a range of prevention methods are implemented, active community involvement is highly important for successful Dengue prevention. Continual evaluation is necessary to make more immediate, long-term behavioral societal changes, and to maximize the economic resources spent on Dengue prevention.

TI  - Can the intake of antiparasitic secondary metabolites explain the low prevalence of hemoparasites among wild Psittaciformes?
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
AB  - Background: Parasites can exert selection pressure on their hosts through effects on survival, on reproductive success, on sexually selected ornament, with important ecological and evolutionary consequences, such as changes in population viability. Consequently, hemoparasites have become the focus of recent avian studies. Infection varies significantly among taxa. Various factors might explain the differences in infection among taxa, including habitat, climate, host density, the presence of vectors, life history and immune defence. Feeding behaviour can also be relevant both through increased exposure to vectors and consumption of secondary metabolites with preventative or therapeutic effects that can reduce parasite load. However, the latter has been little investigated. Psittaciformes (parrots and cockatoos) are a good model to investigate these topics, as they are known to use biological control against ectoparasites and to feed on toxic food. We investigated the presence of avian malaria parasites (Plasmodium), intracellular haemosporidians (Haemoproteus, Leucocytozoon), unicellular flagellate protozoans (Trypanosoma) and microfilariae in 19 Psittaciformes species from a range of habitats in the Indo-Malayan, Australasian and Neotropical regions. We gathered additional data on hemoparasites in wild Psittaciformes from the literature. We considered factors that may control the presence of hemoparasites in the Psittaciformes, compiling information on diet, habitat, and climate. Furthermore, we investigated the role of diet in providing antiparasitic secondary metabolites that could be used as self-medication to reduce parasite load.
   Results: We found hemoparasites in only two of 19 species sampled. Among them, all species that consume at least one food item known for its secondary metabolites with antimalarial, trypanocidal or general antiparasitic properties, were free from hemoparasites. In contrast, the infected parrots do not consume food items with antimalarial or even general antiparasitic properties. We found that the two infected species in this study consumed omnivorous diets. When we combined our data with data from studies previously investigating blood parasites in wild parrots, the positive relationship between omnivorous diets and hemoparasite infestation was confirmed. Individuals from open habitats were less infected than those from forests.
   Conclusions: The consumption of food items known for their secondary metabolites with antimalarial, trypanocidal or general antiparasitic properties, as well as the higher proportion of infected species among omnivorous parrots, could explain the low prevalence of hemoparasites reported in many vertebrates.

TI  - Cellular Growth and Mitochondrial Ultrastructure of <i>Leishmania</i> (<i>Viannia</i>) <i>braziliensis</i> Promastigotes Are Affected by the Iron Chelator 2,2-Dipyridyl
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background: Iron is an essential element for the survival of microorganisms in vitro and in vivo, acting as a cofactor of several enzymes and playing a critical role in host-parasite relationships. Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis is a parasite that is widespread in the new world and considered the major etiological agent of American tegumentary leishmaniasis. Although iron depletion leads to promastigote and amastigote growth inhibition, little is known about the role of iron in the biology of Leishmania. Furthermore, there are no reports regarding the importance of iron for L. (V.) braziliensis.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: In this study, the effect of iron on the growth, ultrastructure and protein expression of L. (V.) braziliensis was analyzed by the use of the chelator 2,2-dipyridyl. Treatment with 2,2-dipyridyl affected parasites' growth in a dose-and time-dependent manner. Multiplication of the parasites was recovered after reinoculation in fresh culture medium. Ultrastructural analysis of treated promastigotes revealed marked mitochondrial swelling with loss of cristae and matrix and the presence of concentric membranar structures inside the organelle. Iron depletion also induced Golgi disruption and intense cytoplasmic vacuolization. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis of tetramethylrhodamine ester-stained parasites showed that 2,2-dipyridyl collapsed the mitochondrial membrane potential. The incubation of parasites with propidium iodide demonstrated that disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential was not associated with plasma membrane permeabilization. TUNEL assays indicated no DNA fragmentation in chelator-treated promastigotes. In addition, two-dimensional electrophoresis showed that treatment with the iron chelator induced up-or down-regulation of proteins involved in metabolism of nucleic acids and coordination of post-translational modifications, without altering their mRNA levels.
   Conclusions: Iron chelation leads to a multifactorial response that results in cellular collapse, starting with the interruption of cell proliferation and culminating in marked mitochondrial impairment in some parasites and their subsequent cell death, whereas others may survive and resume proliferating.

TI  - Employing plant functional groups to advance seed dispersal ecology and conservation
T2  - AOB PLANTS
AB  - Seed dispersal enables plants to reach hospitable germination sites and escape natural enemies. Understanding when and how much seed dispersal matters to plant fitness is critical for understanding plant population and community dynamics. At the same time, the complexity of factors that determine if a seed will be successfully dispersed and subsequently develop into a reproductive plant is daunting. Quantifying all factors that may influence seed dispersal effectiveness for any potential seed-vector relationship would require an unrealistically large amount of time, materials and financial resources. On the other hand, being able to make dispersal predictions is critical for predicting whether single species and entire ecosystems will be resilient to global change. Building on current frameworks, we here posit that seed dispersal ecology should adopt plant functional groups as analytical units to reduce this complexity to manageable levels. Functional groups can be used to distinguish, for their constituent species, whether it matters (i) if seeds are dispersed, (ii) into what context they are dispersed and (iii) what vectors disperse them. To avoid overgeneralization, we propose that the utility of these functional groups may be assessed by generating predictions based on the groups and then testing those predictions against species-specific data. We suggest that data collection and analysis can then be guided by robust functional group definitions. Generalizing across similar species in this way could help us to better understand the population and community dynamics of plants and tackle the complexity of seed dispersal as well as its disruption.
   Seed dispersal is critical to plant fitness and plant community dynamics. However, measuring and tracking all factors that influence seed dispersal effectiveness for any potential seed-disperser relationship would require an unrealistically large amount of time, materials and financial resources. Building on current frameworks, we suggest that seed dispersal ecology quantify seed dispersal at the scale of plant functional groups, in order to reduce complexity to manageable levels. Based on functional group classifications, plant species can be distinguished by their level of dependence on seed dispersal and its mechanisms.

TI  - <i>Hamatospiculum flagellispiculosum</i> (Nematoda: Diplotriaenidae) causing severe disease in a new host from Argentine Patagonia: <i>Campephilus magellanicus</i> (Aves: Picidae)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY-PARASITES AND WILDLIFE
AB  - We describe pathological aspects of an infection caused by parasitic nematodes in skeletal muscles of a Magellanic woodpecker (Campephilus magellanicus), providing the first description of any disease findings in this species. A weakened female with locomotory dysfunction was rescued near Bariloche city (Argentine Patagonia), which soon died. At the necropsy, unexpected masses of tissue were located at three joints (legs and tail). A dissection of these masses exposed numerous nematodes in the musculature surrounding the joints that were identified as Hamatospiculum flagellispiculosum (Nematoda: Diplotriaenidae), a species that was not previously found in Piciformes (woodpeckers, toucans, and allies) of the Neotropical Region. In this report, we complement the original parasite description from 1952 with SEM images, and extend the species range about 2000 km southwards. Histopathological analysis (tissues sectioned 4-6 microns, stained with hematoxylin and eosin) of the affected tissues revealed parasitic myositis with muscle fibrosis. Severe muscle degeneration and necrosis, fibrous tissue replacing muscle tissue, chronic inflammation with widespread diffuse mononuclear infiltration, and parasitic content (adult roundworms, eggs, and eggs with first-stage larvae) were present in all samples. The multifocal nature of these lesions was consistent with the locomotory dysfunction exhibited by the bird. Both the immune response (mononuclear infiltration without eosinophils, which normally fight helminth colonization) and the clinical severity of this case (a lethal, multifocal macroparasite infection) are noteworthy. The expected immune response may have been suppressed through immunomodulation by the parasite, as observed for filarial parasites. Based on their demography and life history traits (i.e., long-lived picids that produce a single nestling every 1-2 years, and live in sparse populations), Magellanic Woodpeckers do not seem to be obvious hosts of an obligately killing parasite, and other (more regular) hosts should be expected to occur in the same region.

TI  - The effect of soil properties on the relation between soil management and Fusarium wilt expression in Gros Michel bananas
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
AB  - Aims This study looks whether the response of soil management (liming and nitrogen fertilization) on the incidence of Fusarium wilt (Foc Race 1) in Gros Michel banana (Musa AAA) varies with different soil properties. Methods The effect of inoculation with Foc Race 1 was studied in a factorial greenhouse trial with soil samples from eight representative soil types from the Costa Rican banana region, two pH levels; and three levels of N-fertilization. After an 8-week period, plant biomass and a disease index were measured. Results There were significant effects of soil pH and N, and their interactions on disease expression. Low pH levels and high N-fertilization increased the disease expression. The response to changes in soil pH and N-fertilization differed considerably between the different soils. Conclusions Although soil pH and N influence Fusarium wilt in banana, each soil differs in its response to these soil properties. This complicates the development of standard soil management strategies in terms of e.g., N-fertilization and liming to mitigate or fight the disease.

TI  - Molecular xenomonitoring of diurnally subperiodic <i>Wuchereria bancrofti</i> infection in <i>Aedes</i> (<i>Downsiomyia</i>) <i>niveus</i> (Ludlow, 1903) after nine rounds of Mass Drug Administration in Nancowry Islands, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, India
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - A group of four human inhabited Nancowry Islands in Nicobar district in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, India having a population of 7674 is the lone focus of diurnally sub-periodic Wuchereria bancrofti (DspWB) that is transmitted by Aedes niveus (Ludlow). Microfilaria (Mf) prevalence was above 1% even after nine rounds of Mass Drug Administration (MDA) with DEC and albendazole. Molecular xenomonitoring (MX) was conducted to identify appropriate vector sampling method and assess the impact. BioGents Sentinel traps, gravid traps and human baited double bed nettraps were used in three locations in each village to collect Aedes niveus female mosquitoes. Subsequently daytime man landing collections (MLC) were carried out in all the 25 villages in the islands. Collections were compared in terms of the number of vector mosquitoes captured per trap collection. Females of Ae. niveus were pooled, dried and processed for detecting filarial parasite DNA using RT-PCR assay. Vector infection rate was estimated using PoolScreen software. Only 393 female mosquitoes including 44 Ae. niveus (11.2%) were collected from 459 trap collections using three trapping devices. From 151 MLCs, 2170 Ae. niveus female mosquitoes were collected. The average prevalence of W. bancrofti DNA was 0.43%. Estimated upper 95% CI exceeded the provisional prevalence threshold of 0.1% in all the villages, indicating continued transmission as observed in Mf survey. MLCs could be the choice, for now, to sample Ae. niveus mosquitoes. The PCR assay used in MX for nocturnally periodic bancroftian filariasis could be adopted for DspWB. The vector-parasite MX, can be used to evaluate interventions in this area after further standardization of the protocol.
   Author summary
   Lymphatic filariasis (LF), caused by nematode parasite-Wuchereria bancrofti, is prevalent in 72 countries with about 1.39 billion people facing the risk of infection. In India LF is endemic in 256 districts. A physiological variant of the parasite, the diurnally sub-periodic Wb (DspWb) is confined to a small pocket of four remotely located isles, in Nicobar district in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The parasite is transmitted by a day-biting and forest dwelling mosquito, Aedes niveus. Even after 9 rounds of Mass Drug Administration under the National Programme for LF elimination, microfilaria prevalence was above transmission threshold level (1%), indicating continued transmission. We studied filarial infection in Ae. niveus using molecular xenomonitoring (MX). The vector mosquito was sampled using BioGents Sentinel, Gravid and human baited double bed net-traps. Since the traps did not yield adequate numbers, man landing collections were carried out. The prevalence filarial infection in mosquitoes assessed by molecular assay was above the provisional threshold level (<0.1%.), confirming that the transmission has not been interrupted. MX protocol can further be standardised for use as a surveillance tool in assessing the impact of MDA in this vector-parasite combination.

TI  - Cryptic occurrence of <i>Chattonella marina</i> var. <i>marina</i> in mangrove sediments in Probolinggo, East Java Province, Indonesia
T2  - FISHERIES SCIENCE
AB  - Mangrove forests and adjacent creeks are known to be highly productive estuaries, which are partly supported by benthic microalgae that grow on the sediments. During surveys investigating the microalgal floras of mangrove swamps in the eastern part of Java Island, a mud sample unexpectedly included large numbers of a notorious fish killer, Chattonella-like motile cells, and its resting cysts. These motile cells were established as clonal cultures for further identification and physiological tests. The cysts were examined through palynological and molecular biological means. Identification based on light microscopy and ribosomal RNA gene sequences confirmed that these cells and cysts were Chattonella marina var. marina. While the strains were genetically identical to the temperate strains isolated from Japan and China, temperature experiments showed that the Indonesian strains possessed a high maximum quantum yield of photosystem II even after exposure to 34 degrees C, a temperature at which the Japanese strain could not survive. Salinity experiments showed adaptation of the strains to a salinity of 15. These findings, together with the discovery of populations of cysts in the mangrove sediment, highlight the tough and unique nature of the Indonesian strains, which are likely adapted to wide fluctuations of temperature and salinity in mangrove swamps, and pose a potential risk to fisheries in Indonesia.

TI  - ONCHOCERCIASIS INFECTION IN CHILDREN BORN DURING 14 YEARS OF SIMULIUM CONTROL IN WEST AFRICA
T2  - TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - The incidence of onchocerciasis infection in children born since the start of vector control is one of the indicators used in the epidemiological evaluation of the Onchocerciasis Control Programme in West Africa (OCP).  Though initially of little value, after a decade of control it has become a sensitive indicator of residual transmission.  The results of 14 years of control are reported.  In 179 villages parasitological surveys were undertaken at intervals of 3-4 years.  15 286 children were examined and 110 were found to be infected, compared to an expected number of 2467 infected had there been no control.  There was considerable geographical variation in the results.  In the large central OCP area the results were excellent.  Of 12 172 children examined in 127 villages, only 23 were found to be infected compared to an expected number of 1960 without control.  This suggests that larviciding had achieved a 99% reduction in the incidence of infection in children.  Additional surveys in 2 foci in the central OCP area where transmission had relapsed showed that these problems were very localized.  Most villages with infected children were found in OCP border areas in the east and west, which had been reinvaded by infective vectors from elsewhere, and in the intermediate area between forest and savanna in Cote d'Ivoire where there had been partial control failures because of resistance.  The incidence of infection in children was reduced by an estimated 68% in the eastern reinvaded area, by 87% in the western reinvaded area, and by 84% in the intermediate area.

TI  - <i>Leishmania naiffi</i> and <i>lainsoni</i> in French Guiana: Clinical features and phylogenetic variability
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - In French Guiana, five species are associated with Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (CL). Though infections withLeishmania guyanensis,L.(V.) braziliensisandL.(L.) amazonensishave been extensively described, there are few available clinical and genetic data onL.(V.) lainsoniandL.(V.) naiffi. We determined the clinical and epidemiological features of all cases of CL due toL.(V.) naiffiandL.(V.) lainsonidiagnosed in French Guiana between 2003 and 2019. Phylogenetic analysis was performed by sequencing a portion ofHSP70andcyt bgenes. Five cases ofL.naiffiand 25 cases ofL.lainsoniwere reported. Patients infected byL.(V.) lainsoniwere usually infected on gold camps, mostly along the Maroni river (60%), whileL.naiffiwas observed in French patients infected on the coast (100%). A high number of pediatric cases (n = 5; 20%) was observed forL.(V.) lainsoni. A mild clinical course was observed for all cases ofL.(V.) naiffi.HSP70andcyt bpartial nucleotide sequence analysis revealed different geographical clusters withinL.(V.) naiffiandL.(V.) lainsonibut no association were found between phylogenetic and clinical features. Our data suggest distinct socio-epidemiological features for these twoLeishmaniaspecies. Patients seem to get infected withL.(V.) naiffiduring leisure activities in anthropized coastal areas, whileL.(V.) lainsonishares common features withL.(V.) guyanensisandbraziliensisand seems to be acquired during professional activities in primary forest regions. Phylogenetic analysis has provided information on the intraspecific genetic variability ofL.(V.) naiffiandL.(V.) lainsoniand how these genotypes are distributed at the geographic level.
   Author summary Cutaneous leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease affecting at least 12 million people in 96 countries. In French Guiana, five species of Leishmania are involved in human disease:Leishmania (V.) guyanensis,Leishmania (V.) braziliensis and Leishmania (L.) amazonensisare common and have been extensively studied.Leishmania (V.) lainsoniandLeishmania (V.) naiffiare less frequent and very few data are available on the patients infected by these species. In this study, we identified five cases of human patients infected byL.(V.) naiffiand 25 cases ofL.(V.) lainsoni. Patients infected byL.(V.) lainsoniwere usually god miners infected in the rainforest, whileL.naiffiwas observed in patients infected on the anthropized coast of French Guiana.L.naiffiwas associated with mild lesions. Pentamidine was an efficient treatment for most cases of both species.

TI  - Interferon-Gamma Release Assays for the Diagnosis of Latent Tuberculosis Infection in HIV-Infected Individuals: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
T2  - JAIDS-JOURNAL OF ACQUIRED IMMUNE DEFICIENCY SYNDROMES
AB  - Objective: To determine whether interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) improve the identification of HIV-infected individuals who could benefit from latent tuberculosis infection therapy. Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis.
   Methods: We searched multiple databases through May 2010 for studies evaluating the performance of the newest commercial IGRAs (QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube [QFT-GIT] and T-SPOT. TB [TSPOT]) in HIV-infected individuals. We assessed the quality of all studies included in the review, summarized results in prespecified subgroups using forest plots, and where appropriate, calculated pooled estimates using random effects models.
   Results: The search identified 37 studies that included 5736 HIV-infected individuals. In three longitudinal studies, the risk of active tuberculosis was higher in HIV-infected individuals with positive versus negative IGRA results. However, the risk difference was not statistically significant in the two studies that reported IGRA results according to manufacturer-recommended criteria. In persons with active tuberculosis (a surrogate reference standard for latent tuberculosis infection), pooled sensitivity estimates were heterogeneous but higher for TSPOT (72%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 62-81%) than for QFT-GIT (61%; 95% CI, 47-75%) in low-/middle-income countries. However, neither IGRA was consistently more sensitive than the tuberculin skin test in head-to-head comparisons. Although TSPOT appeared to be less affected by immunosuppression than QFT-GIT and the tuberculin skin test, overall, differences among the three tests were small or in conclusive.
   Conclusions: Current evidence suggests that IGRAs perform similarly to the tuberculin skin test at identifying HIV-infected individuals with latent tuberculosis infection. Given that both tests have modest predictive value and suboptimal sensitivity, the decision to use either test should be based on country guidelines and resource and logistic considerations.

TI  - Diagnostic Tests to Support Late-Stage Control Programs for Schistosomiasis and Soil-Transmitted Helminthiases
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Global efforts to address schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminthiases (STH) include deworming programs for school-aged children that are made possible by large-scale drug donations. Decisions on these mass drug administration (MDA) programs currently rely on microscopic examination of clinical specimens to determine the presence of parasite eggs. However, microscopy-based methods are not sensitive to the low-intensity infections that characterize populations that have undergone MDA. Thus, there has been increasing recognition within the schistosomiasis and STH communities of the need for improved diagnostic tools to support late-stage control program decisions, such as when to stop or reduce MDA. Failure to adequately address the need for new diagnostics could jeopardize achievement of the 2020 London Declaration goals. In this report, we assess diagnostic needs and landscape potential solutions and determine appropriate strategies to improve diagnostic testing to support control and elimination programs. Based upon literature reviews and previous input from experts in the schistosomiasis and STH communities, we prioritized two diagnostic use cases for further exploration: to inform MDA-stopping decisions and post-MDA surveillance. To this end, PATH has refined target product profiles (TPPs) for schistosomiasis and STH diagnostics that are applicable to these use cases. We evaluated the limitations of current diagnostic methods with regards to these use cases and identified candidate biomarkers and diagnostics with potential application as new tools. Based on this analysis, there is a need to develop antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) with simplified, field-deployable sample preparation for schistosomiasis. Additionally, there is a need for diagnostic tests that are more sensitive than the current methods for STH, which may include either a field-deployable molecular test or a simple, low-cost, rapid antigen-detecting test.

TI  - PCR-RFLP screening of polymorphisms associated with benzimidazole resistance in <i>Necator americanus</i> and <i>Ascaris lumbricoides</i> from different geographical regions in Brazil
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Ascaris lumbricoides and Necator americanus are soil-transmitted parasites with global geographic distribution, and they represent some of the most common and neglected infections in the world. Periodic treatment with mass drug administration (MDA) in endemic areas is the recommended action put forth by the World Health Organization. However, MDA can cause the selection of subpopulations that possess the genetic ability to overcome the mechanism of drug action. In fact, beta-tubulin gene mutations (codons 167, 198 and 200) are correlated with benzimidazole resistance in nematodes of veterinary importance. It is possible that these SNPs also have strong correlation with treatment resistance in the human geohelminths A. lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura and hookworms. Here, we aimed to investigate the presence of some of these canonical molecular markers associated with parasite resistance to benzimidazole in N. americanus and A. lumbricoides collected from six Brazilian states. Nested-PCR and PCR-RFLP were used to detect mutations at codons 167 and 198 in 601 individual eggs of A. lumbricoides collected from 62 human stool samples; however, no mutations were found. Codons 198 and 200 were tested in 552 N. americanus eggs collected from 48 patients using the same methodology, which presented a relative frequency of 1.4% and 1.1%, respectively. The presence of these SNPs in N. americanus eggs is an important finding, indicating that with high benzimidazole drug pressure there is potential for benzimidazole resistance to be selected in this hookworm. However, at these low frequencies it does not indicate that there is at present any benzimidazole resistance problem. This is the first systematic study performed in South America, and the study yielded a landscape of the genetic variants in the beta-tubulin gene and anthelmintic resistance to soil-transmitted parasites detected by a simple, rapid and affordable genotyping assay of individual eggs.

TI  - Global coastal geomorphology-integrating earth observation and geospatial data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Coastal geomorphic classification identifying the type of depositional environment, is an important indicator for coastal state and vulnerability, e.g., beach, bedrock and wetland (tidal flat and estuarine/delta/back-barrier depression). Accurate and current maps of these geomorphology classes from local (100 m(-1) km) to global (105 km) scales are important for a range of objectives in the coastal zone. Previous methods to create coastal geomorphic maps relied heavily on manual efforts and expert opinions. However, these approaches are labour intensive and impractical for consistent application at a global scale, while still including local details. Existing global coastal geomorphology datasets are a compilation of different local-scale datasets, with varying spatial, categorical resolutions and accuracies. The recent availability of "big " and "open " data as well as increased processing capabilities resulted in the use of satellite images and digital elevation models to identify sandy beach and cliff separately. In our work, these raster data were processed on Google Earth Engine, combined with shape descriptors of coastline vectors and then fitted into machine learning models to classify the intertidal coastal geomorphology into bedrock, beach or wetland classes on the global scale (from 56 S to 60 N, excluding coral reef/fringing reef and fjord dominated coasts). A unique attribute of this new method was the incorporation of shape descriptors extracted from shoreline vector data, which substantially improved the classification accuracy. Using existing data from European Union (EU), the United States of America (US) and Australia for training and testing, the model achieved averaged 85% accuracy for testing datasets in these continents and 84% accuracy for 10,000 independent global validation samples beyond these continents. Successful classification was achieved for coasts dominated by a single geomorphology class, as well as more complex environments, such as headland bay and barrier island systems, where multiple classes appear next to each other. The model had relatively less confidence in coasts with sandy cliffs, tall canopy cover and engineered structures. Complete statistics from this study covering 56 S to 60 N showed 36.8% (142,845 km) wetland, 26.7% (103,762 km) beach and 36.5% (141,579 km) bedrock. Beach and bedrock geomorphic classes were commonly detected at mid-latitudes (30o to 60o N/S), while wetland dominated tropical latitudes (0o to 30o N/S). The output dataset can be used for different coastal management purposes. The accuracy and categorical resolution of the classification can be further improved with the development of Earth Observation Big Data in the future.

TI  - Schistosome infection in Senegal is associated with different spatial extents of risk and ecological drivers for <i>Schistosoma haematobium</i> and <i>S. mansoni</i>
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Schistosome parasites infect more than 200 million people annually, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa, where people may be co-infected with more than one species of the parasite. Infection risk for any single species is determined, in part, by the distribution of its obligate intermediate host snail. As the World Health Organization reprioritizes snail control to reduce the global burden of schistosomiasis, there is renewed importance in knowing when and where to target those efforts, which could vary by schistosome species. This study estimates factors associated with schistosomiasis risk in 16 villages located in the Senegal River Basin, a region hyperendemic for Schistosoma haematobium and S. mansoni. We first analyzed the spatial distributions of the two schistosomes' intermediate host snails (Bulinus spp. and Biomphalaria pfeifferi, respectively) at village water access sites. Then, we separately evaluated the relationships between human S. haematobium and S. mansoni infections and (i) the area of remotely-sensed snail habitat across spatial extents ranging from 1 to 120 m from shorelines, and (ii) water access site size and shape characteristics. We compared the influence of snail habitat across spatial extents because, while snail sampling is traditionally done near shorelines, we hypothesized that snails further from shore also contribute to infection risk. We found that, controlling for demographic variables, human risk for S. haematobium infection was positively correlated with snail habitat when snail habitat was measured over a much greater radius from shore (45 m to 120 m) than usual. S. haematobium risk was also associated with large, open water access sites. However, S. mansoni infection risk was associated with small, sheltered water access sites, and was not positively correlated with snail habitat at any spatial sampling radius. Our findings highlight the need to consider different ecological and environmental factors driving the transmission of each schistosome species in co-endemic landscapes.

TI  - Clinical study of anti-snake venom blockade in the treatment of local tissue necrosis caused by Chinese cobra (<i>Naja atra</i>) bites
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Objective
   This study aimed to evaluate the clinical therapeutic efficacy of anti-snake venom serum blockade in treating local tissue necrosis caused by Chinese cobra (Naja atra) bites.
   Methods
   Patients bitten by a Chinese cobra (Naja atra) (n = 50) that met the inclusion criteria were randomly divided into two groups: the experimental group (n = 25) and the control group (n = 25). The experimental group received regular as well as anti-snake venom serum blocking treatment, whereas regular treatment plus chymotrypsin blocking therapy was given to the control group. The necrotic volumes around snake wounds in these groups were detected on the first, third and seventh days. On the third day of treatment, some local tissues in the wounds were randomly selected for pathological biopsy, and the necrosis volume of the local tissue was observed. Furthermore, the amount of time required for wound healing was recorded.
   Results
   On the third and seventh days post-treatment, the necrotic volume of the wound of the experimental group was much smaller than that of the control group, and the experimental group's wound healing time was shorter than that of the control group (all p < 0.05). Moreover, the pathological biopsies taken from the control group showed nuclear pyknosis, fragmentation, sparse nuclear density, and blurred edges, and the degree of necrosis was much higher than that of the experimental group.
   Conclusions
   Anti-snake venom blocking therapy is a new and improved therapy with good clinical effect on local tissue necrosis caused by Chinese cobra bites; moreover, it is superior to conventional chymotrypsin blocking therapy in the treatment of cobra bites. It can better neutralize and prevent the spread of the toxin, reduce tissue necrosis, and shorten the course of the disease by promoting healing of the wound. Furthermore, this treatment plan is also applicable to wound necrosis caused by other snake toxins, such as tissue necrosis caused by elapidae and viper families.
   Author summary
   Chinese cobra bites often cause local tissue necrosis and lead to physical disability, which is the difficulty of treatment. Considering that the cytotoxin in cobra is the main pathogenic factor causing local tissue necrosis, we proposed injecting anti-snake venom locally to increase its concentration in the wound, so as to neutralize the cytolytic activity of snake venom. In order to verify the clinical efficacy of the therapy, a randomized controlled trial were conducted: the experimental group was treated with anti-snake venom blocking therapy, while the control group was treated with chymotrypsin blocking therapy. The clinical efficacy was evaluated by comparing the local wound necrosis, wound healing time, etc. as the indicators. Then, the results showed that the experimental group had smaller wound necrosis area and also much shorter healing time than the control group, which clearly indicated that the local blocking treatment with anti-snake venom serum has much better clinical efficacy. Meanwhile, theoretically, the anti-snake venom blocking therapy is also suitable for the treatment against other snake bites. So, in future we expect to conduct more clinical studies on this, which will provide information on new treatments with much better clinical efficacy for patients.

TI  - Preliminary molecular characterization of a proinflammatory and nociceptive molecule from the <i>Echinometra lucunter</i> spines extracts
T2  - JOURNAL OF VENOMOUS ANIMALS AND TOXINS INCLUDING TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background: Sea urchins are animals commonly found on the Brazilian shoreline, being Echinometra lucunter the most abundant species. Accidents caused by E. lucunter have been reported as one of the most frequent in Brazil, and are characterized by intense pain and inflammation, consequence of spine puncture in the skin. In order to characterize such toxic effects, we isolated one molecule that caused inflammatory and nociceptive effects.
   Methods: E. lucunter specimens were collected without gender distinction. Spines were removed and molecules were extracted, fractionated by RP-HPLC and assayed for inflammatory and nociceptive activity, in a biological-driven fractionation way, until the obtainment of one active molecule and its subsequent analysis by mass spectrometry (MS and MS/MS). For inflammation, intravital microscopy was performed on the mouse cremaster muscle, in order to evaluate rolled, adherent and migrating leukocytes. Paw edema was also evaluated. For the nociceptive activity, the paw pressure test was performed in rats.
   Results: One molecule could be isolated and related to the inflammatory and nociceptive activity. Regarding inflammation, increase in adherent and migrating cells was observed in the cremaster muscle after the administration of the molecule. Corroborating the inflammatory response, paw edema was also observed, although only in 20% of controls and 20 min after injection. Additionally, this molecule was able to decrease significantly the pain threshold, characterizing hyperalgesia. This molecule was analyzed by mass spectrometry, and according to the exact molecular mass, isotopic distribution and fragmentation profile, it was possible to propose the molecular formula C29H48N3O10.
   Conclusions: One isolated molecule from the spine extract of E. lucunter is able to elicit inflammation and hypernociception in animal models, which is in agreement with the effects observed in sea urchin accidents.

TI  - Freshwater mollusks from three reservoirs of Piaui, northeastern Brazil
T2  - BIOTA NEOTROPICA
AB  - The pronounced dry season determines the characteristics of the semiarid region of Brazil. Numerous small reservoirs are built to overcome this condition, accumulating multiple uses and causing important changes in the landscape and the local biota. Considering the limited amount of information about the malacofauna of reservoirs, mainly in the Northeast region of the country, this inventory provides a list of mollusks from three important reservoirs located in the city of Sao Juliao, state of Piaui. The collections were carried out monthly between May/2017 and April/2018, sampling a total of 11,149 mollusks, corresponding to the species Melanoides tuberculata (Muller, 1774) (n = 9,724), Biomphalaria straminea (Dunker, 1848) (n = 1,361) and Pomacea lineata (Spix, 1827) (n = 64). The richness of mollusks from the three reservoirs was low, similar to those described in studies conducted in other regions of Northeast Brazil. There was a significant difference in the abundance of M. tuberculata and B. straminea among the studied reservoirs. These environments are not connected and are installed in urban and rural areas, presenting different ecological conditions. The relationship between the human population and the reservoirs, associated with the lack of sanitation, increases the risks of spreading waterborne diseases besides the development of environmental imbalance by the introduction of exotic species.

TI  - eDNA metabarcoding of avocado flowers: 'Hass' it got potential to survey arthropods in food production systems?
T2  - MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES
AB  - In the face of global biodiversity declines, surveys of beneficial and antagonistic arthropod diversity as well as the ecological services that they provide are increasingly important in both natural and agro-ecosystems. Conventional survey methods used to monitor these communities often require extensive taxonomic expertise and are time-intensive, potentially limiting their application in industries such as agriculture, where arthropods often play a critical role in productivity (e.g. pollinators, pests and predators). Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding of a novel substrate, crop flowers, may offer an accurate and high throughput alternative to aid in the detection of these managed and unmanaged taxa. Here, we compared the arthropod communities detected with eDNA metabarcoding of flowers, from an agricultural species (Persea americana-'Hass' avocado), with two conventional survey techniques: digital video recording (DVR) devices and pan traps. In total, 80 eDNA flower samples, 96 h of DVRs and 48 pan trap samples were collected. Across the three methods, 49 arthropod families were identified, of which 12 were unique to the eDNA dataset. Environmental DNA metabarcoding from flowers revealed potential arthropod pollinators, as well as plant pests and parasites. Alpha diversity levels did not differ across the three survey methods although taxonomic composition varied significantly, with only 12% of arthropod families found to be common across all three methods. eDNA metabarcoding of flowers has the potential to revolutionize the way arthropod communities are monitored in natural and agro-ecosystems, potentially detecting the response of pollinators and pests to climate change, diseases, habitat loss and other disturbances.

TI  - Intercropping with Chinese leek decreased <i>Meloidogyne javanica</i> population and shifted microbial community structure in Sacha Inchi plantation
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE
AB  - The root-knot nematode, Meloidogyne javanica, is a major problem for the production of Sacha Inchi plants. We examined the effects of strip intercropping of Sacha Inchi/Chinese leek of 3-4 years on the seasonal dynamics of plant and soil traits in tropical China. Results indicated that in the intercropping system, a partially temporal divergence of belowground resource acquisition via niche separation occurred throughout the growing seasons, besides a complete spatially-separated plant height between the two crops. Compared with Sacha Inchi monoculture, the increased seed yield per unit area in the intercropping system was mainly attributed to the higher plant survival rate, rather than the enhanced plant traits of healthy plants. Intercropping greatly suppressed M. javanica populations only in the wet season, compared with monoculture; which may be associated with the combined effects of the direct allelopathy and indigenous microbe induced-suppressiveness. Intercropping did not affect microbial richness and alpha-diversity in the rhizosphere, except for the decreased fungal richness. Both bacterial and fungal composition and structure were diverged between monoculture v. intercropping system. The relative abundances of the dominant bacterial genera (Bacillus, Gaiellales, Lactococcus, Massilia and Lysobacter, etc.) differed significantly between the two cropping systems. For fungi, intercropping decreased the relative abundances of Fusarium and Gibberella, but increased those of Nectriaceae_unclassified, Chaetomiaceae, Humicola and Mortierella. Overall, Sacha Inchi/Chinese leek intercropping suppressed M. javanica populations and shifted microbial compositions (especially decreased pathogen-containing Fusarium). The increased yield and economic returns in this intercropping system provide valid information for the effective agricultural management.

TI  - Endophytic <i>Trichoderma</i> species from rubber trees native to the Brazilian Amazon, including four new species
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Fungi belonging to the genus Trichoderma have been widely recognized as efficient controllers of plant diseases. Although the majority of isolates currently deployed, thus far, have been isolated from soil, endophytic Trichoderma spp. is considered to be a promising option for application in biocontrol. In this study, 30 endophytic Trichoderma isolates-obtained from the leaves, stems, and roots of wild Hevea spp. in the Brazilian Amazon-were analyzed using specific DNA barcodes: sequences of internal transcribed spacers 1 and 2 of rDNA (ITS region), genes encoding translation elongation factor 1-alpha (TEF1-alpha), and the second largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (RPB2). The genealogical concordance phylogenetic species recognition (GCPSR) concept was used for species delimitation. A phylogenetic analysis showed the occurrence of Trichoderma species, such as T. erinaceum, T. ovalisporum, T. koningiopsis, T. sparsum, T. lentiforme, T. virens, and T. spirale. Molecular and morphological features resulted in the discovery of four new species, such as T. acreanum sp. nov., T. ararianum sp. nov., T. heveae sp. nov., and T. brasiliensis sp. nov. The BI and ML analyses shared a similar topology, providing high support to the final trees. The phylograms show three distinct subclades, namely, T. acreanum and T. ararianum being paraphyletic with T. koningiopsis; T. heveae with T. subviride; and T. brasiliensis with T. brevicompactum. This study adds to our knowledge of the diversity of endophytic Trichoderma species in Neotropical forests and reveals new potential biocontrol agents for the management of plant diseases.

TI  - The role of agroforestry systems in reconciling food and cocoa (<i>Theobroma</i> <i>cacao</i> L.) and coffee (<i>Coffea</i> spp. L.) production in a changing environment
T2  - TROPICAL AGRICULTURE
AB  - Perennial export crops such as cocoa (Theobroma cacao L.) and coffee (Coffea spp. L.) contribute indirectly to food security by providing an income that can be used to buy food, household goods and/or supplies for the cultivation of basic food crops. Thus, any perennial crop loss incurred due to the effects of climate change will also negatively impact food security and, more generally, the livelihoods of smallholders, farmers and rural communities. It is foreseen that in the not so distant future (2050), climate change and increased land use for food crop production, to meet increasing demands for food as the world's population increases, will negatively impact global production of perennial crops such as coffee and cocoa by reducing the availability of land suitable for their cultivation. Furthermore, the current trend towards full sun systems with excessive use of external inputs (agrochemicals, irrigation) increases the vulnerability of the cocoa and coffee sectors to climate change. To reconcile the need for food crops and the demand for export crops such as coffee and cocoa, under the scenarios of climate change and population growth, innovative production systems have to be developed. Such systems should also contribute to the mitigation of and adaptation to climate change and provide other ecosystem services such as regulation of pests and diseases. Agroforestry systems are some of the production systems which can address these manifold demands. Here, ideas for the development of competitive and sustainable agroforestry systems and the evaluation of their environmental benefits are presented and reviewed.

TI  - Catalogue of Blattaria (Insecta) from Argentina
T2  - ZOOTAXA
AB  - An updated catalogue is given of the cockroach species recorded in Argentina. It includes a list of species, their distribution in the different provinces of the country, the institutions in which the type specimens are deposited, and an updated list of references. The results indicate 87 (plus 2 incertae sedis) species, included in 4 families, 12 subfamilies and 40 currently recognized genera. A few species are widely spread across the country, but 35% (29 + 2 incertae sedis) are only known to occur in Argentina. The biotic affinities of the biogeographic provinces were studied. The data analysis corresponds with the major areas of influence: the Neotropical and Andean regions. A parsimony analysis of endemicity (PAE) was performed. The Parana Forest, Pampa and Chaco biogeographic provinces are supported by numerous endemic species. The families Blaberidae, Blattellidae and Phyllodromiidae include 90% of the species. The cockroach fauna from Argentina is still poorly known and the number of species undoubtedly is higher. The primary homonym of Chorisoneura minuta Rocha e Silva & Aguiar, 1977 was replaced with Chorisoneura rochaesilvae nom. n.

TI  - Signs and symptoms to determine if a patient presenting in primary care or hospital outpatient settings has COVID-19
T2  - COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS
AB  - Background
   The clinical implications of SARS-CoV-2 infection are highly variable. Some people with SARS-CoV-2 infection remain asymptomatic, whilst the infection can cause mild to moderate COVID-19 and COVID-19 pneumonia in others. This can lead to some people requiring intensive care support and, in some cases, to death, especially in older adults. Symptoms such as fever, cough, or loss of smell or taste, and signs such as oxygen saturation are the first and most readily available diagnostic information. Such information could be used to either rule out COVID-19, or select patients for further testing. This is an update of this review, the first version of which published in July 2020.
   Objectives
   To assess the diagnostic accuracy of signs and symptoms to determine if a person presenting in primary care or to hospital outpatient settings, such as the emergency department or dedicated COVID-19 clinics, has COVID-19.
   Search methods
   For this review iteration we undertook electronic searches up to 15 July 2020 in the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register and the University of Bern living search database. In addition, we checked repositories of COVID-19 publications. We did not apply any language restrictions.
   Selection criteria
   Studies were eligible if they included patients with clinically suspected COVID-19, or if they recruited known cases with COVID-19 and controls without COVID-19. Studies were eligible when they recruited patients presenting to primary care or hospital outpatient settings. Studies in hospitalised patients were only included if symptoms and signs were recorded on admission or at presentation. Studies including patients who contracted SARS-CoV-2 infection while admitted to hospital were not eligible. The minimum eligible sample size of studies was 10 participants. All signs and symptoms were eligible for this review, including individual signs and symptoms or combinations. We accepted a range of reference standards.
   Data collection and analysis
   Pairs of review authors independently selected all studies, at both title and abstract stage and full-text stage. They resolved any disagreements by discussion with a third review author. Two review authors independently extracted data and resolved disagreements by discussion with a third review author. Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias using the Quality Assessment tool for Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) checklist. We presented sensitivity and specificity in paired forest plots, in receiver operating characteristic space and in dumbbell plots. We estimated summary parameters using a bivariate random-effects meta-analysis whenever five or more primary studies were available, and whenever heterogeneity across studies was deemed acceptable.
   Main results
   We identified 44 studies including 26,884 participants in total. Prevalence of COVID-19 varied from 3% to 71% with a median of 21%. There were three studies from primary care settings (1824 participants), nine studies from outpatient testing centres (10,717 participants), 12 studies performed in hospital outpatient wards (5061 participants), seven studies in hospitalised patients (1048 participants), 10 studies in the emergency department (3173 participants), and three studies in which the setting was not specified (5061 participants). The studies did not clearly distinguish mild from severe COVID-19, so we present the results for all disease severities together.
   Fifteen studies had a high risk of bias for selection of participants because inclusion in the studies depended on the applicable testing and referral protocols, which included many of the signs and symptoms under study in this review. This may have especially influenced the sensitivity of those features used in referral protocols, such as fever and cough. Five studies only included participants with pneumonia on imaging, suggesting that this is a highly selected population. In an additional 12 studies, we were unable to assess the risk for selection bias. This makes it very difficult to judge the validity of the diagnostic accuracy of the signs and symptoms from these included studies.
   The applicability of the results of this review update improved in comparison with the original review. A greater proportion of studies included participants who presented to outpatient settings, which is where the majority of clinical assessments for COVID-19 take place. However, still none of the studies presented any data on children separately, and only one focused specifically on older adults.
   We found data on 84 signs and symptoms. Results were highly variable across studies. Most had very low sensitivity and high specificity. Only cough (25 studies) and fever (7 studies) had a pooled sensitivity of at least 50% but specificities were moderate to low. Cough had a sensitivity of 67.4% (95% confidence interval (CI) 59.8% to 74.1%) and specificity of 35.0% (95% CI 28.7% to 41.9%). Fever had a sensitivity of 53.8% (95% CI 35.0% to 71.7%) and a specificity of 67.4% (95% CI 53.3% to 78.9%). The pooled positive likelihood ratio of cough was only 1.04 (95% CI 0.97 to 1.11) and that of fever 1.65 (95% CI 1.41 to 1.93).
   Anosmia alone (11 studies), ageusia alone (6 studies), and anosmia or ageusia (6 studies) had sensitivities below 50% but specificities over 90%. Anosmia had a pooled sensitivity of 28.0% (95% CI 17.7% to 41.3%) and a specificity of 93.4% (95% CI 88.3% to 96.4%). Ageusia had a pooled sensitivity of 24.8% (95% CI 12.4% to 43.5%) and a specificity of 91.4% (95% CI 81.3% to 96.3%). Anosmia or ageusia had a pooled sensitivity of 41.0% (95% CI 27.0% to 56.6%) and a specificity of 90.5% (95% CI 81.2% to 95.4%). The pooled positive likelihood ratios of anosmia alone and anosmia or ageusia were 4.25 (95% CI 3.17 to 5.71) and 4.31 (95% CI 3.00 to 6.18) respectively, which is just below our arbitrary definition of a 'red flag', that is, a positive likelihood ratio of at least 5. The pooled positive likelihood ratio of ageusia alone was only 2.88 (95% CI 2.02 to 4.09).
   Only two studies assessed combinations of different signs and symptoms, mostly combining fever and cough with other symptoms. These combinations had a specificity above 80%, but at the cost of very low sensitivity (< 30%).
   Authors' conclusions
   The majority of individual signs and symptoms included in this review appear to have very poor diagnostic accuracy, although this should be interpreted in the context of selection bias and heterogeneity between studies. Based on currently available data, neither absence nor presence of signs or symptoms are accurate enough to rule in or rule out COVID-19. The presence of anosmia or ageusia may be useful as a red flag for COVID-19. The presence of fever or cough, given their high sensitivities, may also be useful to identify people for further testing.
   Prospective studies in an unselected population presenting to primary care or hospital outpatient settings, examining combinations of signs and symptoms to evaluate the syndromic presentation of COVID-19, are still urgently needed. Results from such studies could inform subsequent management decisions.

TI  - Ethanol extracts of Hizikia fusiforme induce apoptosis in human prostate cancer PC3 cells via modulating a ROS-dependent pathway
T2  - ASIAN PACIFIC JOURNAL OF TROPICAL BIOMEDICINE
AB  - Objective: To investigate whether ethanol extracts of Hizikia fusiforme could induce apoptosis in human prostate cancer PC3 cells.Methods: Cell viability was evaluated using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol- 2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide. Apoptosis and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) were measured using flow cytometry in PC3 cells. DNA damage was assessed by nuclear staining and DNA fragmentation assay. Expressions of apoptosis-associated proteins were determined by Western blotting assays. Activities of caspase-3, -8, and -9 were determined by colorimetric assay. Moreover, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation was detected using a flow cytometer and fluorescence microscope.Results: Treatment of PC3 cells with ethanol extracts of Hizikia fusiforme inhibited proliferation, which was associated with induction of apoptosis, and accompanied by increased expression of Fas, Fas-ligand (FasL), Bax and tBid, and decreased expression of Bcl-2. In addition, ethanol extracts of Hizikia fusiforme reduced c-Flip expression and activated caspase-8, -9 and -3, resulting in an increase in poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)cleavage. However, in the presence of a pan-caspase inhibitor, ethanol extracts of Hizikia fusiforme-mediated growth inhibition and apoptosis were significantly attenuated. Ethanol extracts of Hizikia fusiforme also destroyed the integrity of mitochondria due to the loss of MMP, leading to cytosolic release of cytochrome c. Moreover, the levels of ROS were markedly increased by treatment with ethanol extracts of Hizikia fusiforme, which was significantly suppressed by the ROS scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine. Further investigation of whether ethanol extracts of Hizikia fusiforme-induced apoptosis was related to the generation of ROS was conducted and the results showed that N-acetyl-L-cysteine fully blocked ethanol extracts of Hizikia fusiforme-induced apoptotic events including loss of MMP, activation of caspase-3, the cytosolic release of cytochrome c and cytotoxicity.Conclusions: Ethanol extracts of Hizikia fusiforme have chemopreventive potential via induction of ROS-dependent apoptosis. Therefore, ethanol extracts of Hizikia fusiforme may be useful for developing effective and selective natural sources to inhibit cancer cell proliferation.

TI  - Health worker effectiveness and retention in rural Cambodia
T2  - RURAL AND REMOTE HEALTH
AB  - Introduction: A decade after health sector reform, public health services in rural Cambodia remain under-utilised for multiple reasons related to financial, structural and personnel factors. Ineffectiveness of rural public health services has led to a significant increase in private providers, often the same people who staff public facilities. Public health clinics are often portrayed as low quality, with long waiting times and unexpected costs; in contrast, private clinics are seen to provide more convenient health care. Several strategies, including contract management and health equity funds, have been introduced to improve public sector performance and encourage utilization; these efforts are ongoing. However, the feasibility of these strategies remains in question, particularly in terms of cost-effectiveness and sustainability.
   Methods: In this article the strategies of and barriers met by health workers who remain in rural areas and deliver public health services are elucidated. Ethnographic research conducted in 2008 with health providers involved in treating tuberculosis patients in Kampong Speu Province, Cambodia is drawn on. Participants were recruited from the provincial health department, provincial hospital and four health centres. Data collection involved in-depth interviews, participation in meetings and workshops aimed at health workers, and observation of daily activities at the health facilities. Data were transcribed verbatim, imported into NVivo software (www.qsrinternational.com) for management, and analysed using a grounded theory approach.
   Results: Primary healthcare service delivery in rural Cambodia was reliant on the retention of mid-level of health staff, primarily midwives and nurses. Its performance was influenced by institutional characteristics relating to the structure of the health system. Personal factors were impacted on by these structural issues and affected the performance of health staff. Institutional factors worked against the provision of high-quality public health services, and included the fragmentation of service delivery and structure, limited capacity and shortage of high-qualified health staff, competition with the private sector, and shortage of medical supplies. These factors all de-motivated health staff, and undermined their performance in public service positions. Personal factors were paramount for staff retention. These included: optimism and appreciation of work responsibilities and position, the personal ability to cope with financial barriers, and institutional benefits such as opportunities for professional development, job security, financial opportunities (via performance-based allowances), and status in society. Individual financial coping strategies were the dominant factor underlying retention, but alone were often de-motivating: clients were diverted from the public services, which led to distrust, and thus undermined the capacity of public system. There was significant interaction between institutional and personal factors, which impacted on the effectiveness of health staff retention in rural areas. Health workers tended to remain in their government positions for prolonged periods of time because they experienced personal rewards. At the same time, however, their job performance in the public health services were hindered by challenges related to the institutional factors.
   Conclusions: The interaction between institutional factors and personal factors was crucial for effectiveness of health staff retention in rural Cambodia. Efforts aimed at ensuring quality of care and encouraging health staff retention should attempt to remove the institutional barriers that discourage the use of rural public health services.

TI  - <i>Areca catechu</i>-From farm to food and biomedical applications
T2  - PHYTOTHERAPY RESEARCH
AB  - The family Arecaceae includes 181 genera and 2,600 species with a high diversity in physical characteristics.Arecaplants, commonly palms, which are able to grow in nearly every type of habitat, prefer tropical and subtropical climates. The most studied speciesAreca catechuL. contains phytochemicals as phenolics and alkaloids with biological properties. The phenolics are mainly distributed in roots followed by fresh unripe fruits, leaves, spikes, and veins, while the contents of alkaloids are in the order of roots, fresh unripe fruits, spikes, leaves, and veins. This species has been reputed to provide health effects on the cardiovascular, respiratory, nervous, metabolic, gastrointestinal, and reproductive systems. However, in many developing countries, quid from this species has been associated with side effects, which include the destruction of the teeth, impairment of oral hygiene, bronchial asthma, or oral cancer. Despite these side effects, which are also mentioned in this work, the present review collects the main results of biological properties of the phytochemicals inA. catechu. This study emphasizes the in vitro and in vivo antioxidant, antimicrobial, anticancer, and clinical effectiveness in humans. In this sense,A. catechuhave demonstrated effectiveness in several reports through in vitro and in vivo experiments on disorders such as antimicrobial, antioxidant, or anticancer. Moreover, our findings demonstrate that this species presents clinical effectiveness on neurological disorders. Hence,A. catechuextracts could be used as a bioactive ingredient for functional food, nutraceuticals, or cosmeceuticals. However, further studies, especially extensive and comprehensive clinical trials, are recommended for the use ofArecain the treatment of diseases.

TI  - Indigenous environmental indicators for malaria: A district study in Zimbabwe
T2  - ACTA TROPICA
AB  - This paper discusses indigenous environmental indicators for the occurrence of malaria in ward 11, 15 and 18 of Gwanda district, Zimbabwe. The study was inspired by the successes of use of indigenous knowledge systems in community based early warning systems for natural disasters. To our knowledge, no study has examined the relationship between malaria epidemics and climatic factors in Gwanda district. The aim of the study was to determine the environmental indicators for the occurrence of malaria. Twenty eight key informants from the 3 wards were studied. Questionnaires, focus group discussions and PRA sessions were used to collect data. Content analysis was used to analyse the data. The local name for malaria was 'uqhugho' literally meaning a fever. The disease is also called, "umkhuhlane wemiyane" and is derived from the association between malaria and mosquitoes. The findings of our study reveal that trends in malaria incidence are perceived to positively correlate with variations in both temperature and rainfall, although factors other than climate seem to play an important role too. Plant phenology and insects are the commonly used indicators in malaria prediction in the study villages. Other indicators for malaria prediction included the perceived noise emanating from mountains, referred to as "roaring of mountains" and certain behaviours exhibited by ostriches. The results of the present study highlight the importance of using climatic information in the analysis of malaria surveillance data, and this knowledge can be integrated into the conventional health system to develop a community based malaria forecasting system.

TI  - Hypouricemic effect of gallic acid, a bioactive compound from <i>Sonneratia apetala</i> leaves and branches, on hyperuricemic mice
T2  - FOOD & FUNCTION
AB  - As a tropical medicinal plant, Sonneratia apetala is mainly distributed in the southeast coastal areas of China. Recently, the hypouricemic effect of Sonneratia apetala leaves and branches (SAL) has been reported, but the active compound and its mechanism are unclear. Thus, this study aims to explore the effective fraction of SAL and the mechanism of its active compound on uric acid formation and excretion. SAL was extracted with ethyl acetate and concentrated to obtain solvent-free extracts (SAL-EA). The remains fraction (SAL-E) and the supernatant fraction (SAL-S) of SAL resulting from water extraction and alcohol precipitation were collected and dried. The effects of different fractions were explored on hyperuricemic mice. SAL-S showed excellent activities in decreasing the levels of uric acid (UA), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine (CRE) in serum and in attenuating kidney damage. Then, the active compound gallic acid (GA) identified by HPLC was assayed for its mechanism of regulating uric acid metabolism in hyperuricemic mice. The hypouricemic effect of GA was probably associated with the downregulation of URAT1 and GLUT9, upregulation of ABCG2 and decreased activities of adenosine deaminase (ADA) and xanthine oxidase (XOD). Moreover, GA suppressed the level of MDA, IL-6, IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, TGF-beta 1, COX-2 and cystatin-C (Cys-C), and enhanced the activities of SOD, GSH-Px, CAT, and Na+-K+-ATPase (NKA) in the kidneys. These results indicated that GA protects against hyperuricemia-induced kidney injury via suppressing oxidative stress and inflammation as well as decreasing the serum levels of UA by regulating urate transporters.

TI  - <i>Fusarium</i> wilt of banana: Current update and sustainable disease control using classical and essential oils approaches
T2  - HORTICULTURAL PLANT JOURNAL
AB  - Fusarium species were reported to produce biofilms. Biofilms are superficial societies of microbes bounded and endangered by being situated or taking place outside a cell or cells. The most destructive fungal diseases caused by phytopathogens are as a result of biofilms formation. Fusarium wilt of banana (Panama disease) is caused by a soil-borne pathogen called Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense. Fusarium oxysporum occurs in a form of a species complex (FOSC) which encompasses a crowd of strains. Horizontal genetic factor transfer may donate to the observed assortment in pathogenic strains, while sexual reproduction is unknown in the FOSC. Fusarium wilt is a notorious disease on several crops worldwide. Yield loss caused by this pathogen is huge, and significant to destroy crop yields annually, thereby affecting the producer countries in various continents of the world. The disease is also resistant to various synthetic chemical fungicides. However, excessive use of synthetic fungicides during disease control could be lethal to humans, animals, and plants. This calls for alternative eco-friendly management of this disease by targeting the biofilms formation and finally suppressing this devastating phytopathogen. In this review, we, therefore, described the damage caused by Fusarium wilt disease, the concept of filamentous fungal biofilms, classical control strategies, sustainable disease control strategies using essential oils, and prevention and control of vegetables Fusarium wilt diseases.

TI  - CLIMATE VARIABLES EFFECT ON EBONY LEAF MORPHOLOGY AND ITS REGIONAL IDENTIFICATION
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL FOREST SCIENCE
AB  - Ebony is a member of Diospyros genus, commercially used for furniture, sculpture, musical instruments and others. Ebony can be found to grow naturally in Sulawesi, Indonesia. According to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, ebony is included in the vulnerable category because of its decreasing population size due to the demand for the wood is not balanced by the successful cultivation. In the natural ecology, its growth performance is influenced by climate variables and soil properties which affects stand productivity and resilience including morphological responses. The extent to which leaf morphological responses due to climate variability have not been studied using extensive leaf samples collected from a wide range of natural distribution. The generated data that could be used to determine among others the suitability of growing sites and origins. This study aimed to analyse the variability of leaf morphology according to climatic condition and classify the morphology of ebony leaves by region based on support vector machine method. Results showed that climate variables such as temperature, rainfall and length of sun exposure have significant relationship to the morphology of ebony leaf. Moreover, the classification results by using support vector machine to identify ebony leaf morphology based on the region obtained a mean accuracy rate of 86.89%.

TI  - Using computer vision to identify seed-borne fungi and other targets associated with common bean seeds based on red-green-blue spectral data
T2  - TROPICAL PLANT PATHOLOGY
AB  - The science of seed pathology has been established since the development and application of standardized methods for assessing seed health to meet the needs of the seed industry and associated regulatory entities. Despite seed health testing being a routine operation in most countries, results of testing often vary from one laboratory to another. We evaluated computer vision using red-green-blue (RGB) imagery and machine learning algorithms to detect seed-borne fungi on common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) seeds. Seeds of common bean were submitted to the standard blotter test for 7 days, followed by fungal identification using a stereo- and light microscope. A scanning electron microscope was used to confirm fungal identity. Images of seed-borne fungi were captured from a distance of approximately 5 cm. Seventeen spectral indices were derived from the RGB images. Targets of interest in the images were obtained using spatial polygons with attributes used for training six machine learning algorithms (random forest (rf), rpart, rpart1SE, rpart2, naive Bayes, and svmLinear2), with a total of five replicates per target that were identified as Aspergillus flavus, A. niger, A. ochraceus, Penicillium sp., Mucor sp, Rhizopus sp, Fusarium sp, Rhizoctonia sp., common bean tegument, and blotter paper. After a fivefold cross-validation process and a confusion matrix, the rf algorithm had the highest prediction success to detect the targets (accuracy 0.80 and Kappa 0.77, respectively). The brightness index was the most important variable in predicting targets by the rf. Using the rpart1SE algorithm, a decision tree for target identification was obtained with an accuracy of 0.70 and a Kappa value of 0.66, respectively. The rf, svmLinear2, and rpart1SE were found to be the most robust classification algorithms for predicting identification of the fungal species and other targets associated with common bean seed blotter tests using digital RGB images and indices. The use of spectral indices derived from RGB imagery has extended the training capability of algorithms, demonstrated by the importance of the variables and decision tree used for target prediction by the rf and rpart1SE algorithms, respectively.

TI  - Microsatellite based molecular epidemiology of <i>Leishmania infantum</i> from re-emerging foci of visceral leishmaniasis in Armenia and pilot risk assessment by ecological niche modeling
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Author summary
   Leishmaniasis is a vector-borne disease caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania. In Armenia visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is re-emerging since 1999 after a long break of 30 years, with 167 cases recorded until 2019. Molecular diagnosis of VL was implemented only in 2016, and the causative agent was identified as L. infantum. In the present study we expanded the investigation of the causative agent to a characterization at strain level and the identification of its phylogenetic position among the L. infantum genotypes circulating worldwide. This is the first study addressing genetic diversity and population structure of L. infantum in Armenia and in Transcaucasia. Armenia is an extremely interesting region due to its bio-geographic specificities e.g. the high number of different climates in this small mountainous country and the observed high diversity of sand fly species, part of which occurring in very high altitudes. Ecological niche modeling based on registered VL cases and sand fly vectors collected in active VL foci revealed that the risk of further spread of VL is very high due to climate change. Studies of this region should be expanded to enable targeted control measures.
   Background
   Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is re-emerging in Armenia since 1999 with 167 cases recorded until 2019. The objectives of this study were (i) to determine for the first time the genetic diversity and population structure of the causative agent of VL in Armenia; (ii) to compare these genotypes with those from most endemic regions worldwide; (iii) to monitor the diversity of vectors in Armenia; (iv) to predict the distribution of the vectors and VL in time and space by ecological niche modeling.
   Methodology/Principal findings
   Human samples from different parts of Armenia previously identified by ITS-1-RFLP as L. infantum were studied by Multilocus Microsatellite Typing (MLMT). These data were combined with previously typed L. infantum strains from the main global endemic regions for population structure analysis. Within the 23 Armenian L. infantum strains 22 different genotypes were identified. The combined analysis revealed that all strains belong to the worldwide predominating MON1-population, however most closely related to a subpopulation from Southeastern Europe, Maghreb, Middle East and Central Asia. The three observed Armenian clusters grouped within this subpopulation with strains from Greece/Turkey, and from Central Asia, respectively. Ecological niche modeling based on VL cases and collected proven vectors (P. balcanicus, P. kandelakii) identified Yerevan and districts Lori, Tavush, Syunik, Armavir, Ararat bordering Georgia, Turkey, Iran and Azerbaijan as most suitable for the vectors and with the highest risk for VL transmission. Due to climate change the suitable habitat for VL transmission will expand in future all over Armenia.
   Conclusions
   Genetic diversity and population structure of the causative agent of VL in Armenia were addressed for the first time. Further genotyping studies should be performed with samples from infected humans, animals and sand flies from all active foci including the neighboring countries to understand transmission cycles, re-emergence, spread, and epidemiology of VL in Armenia and the entire Transcaucasus enabling epidemiological monitoring.

TI  - PROGENY PERFORMANCE AND PATHOGEN ATTACK RELATIVE TO ELEVATION IN A NEOTROPICAL TREE
T2  - CERNE
AB  - Climate and resource availability at the parent tree location are known to explain progeny characteristics; however, few studies have examined the role of resistance or tolerance to pathogens, even though climate is a main driver of pathogen abundance. We hypothesize that climate at the parent tree location has a relatively greater influence on progeny resistance or tolerance to pathogens than other progeny characteristics, such as seed mass or seedling growth. As a study species we used the vulnerable Neotropical tree Kageneckia lanceolata known to be susceptible to damping-off diseases. We collected seeds from 60 trees along the species entire elevational gradient in central Argentina as a surrogate for climatic gradient and selected an ample array of parent tree sizes and rockiness under the crown as surrogate of tree access to resources. Seedling survival in a common nursery significantly increased with elevation of the parent tree from 40 to 80 % (P < 0.001), with damping-off being the only identified cause of mortality. We also found a non-significant trend suggesting that proportional growth during the cold semester increased with elevation (P = 0.083). Seed mass, germination, and growth of seedlings were not significantly influenced by elevation (P > 0.05). Parent tree size and rockiness were not related to any of the measured progeny characteristics. We conclude that the pathogenic environment around parental plants might have a great influence on progeny resistance or tolerance to pathogens and suggest that incorporating the pathogen dimension into future progeny studies may yield important findings.

TI  - Rapid Epidemiological and Entomological Survey for Validation of Reported Indicators and Characterization of Local Malaria Transmission in Guinea, 2017
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - To confirm and investigate possible explanations for unusual trends in malaria indicators, a protocol for rapid, focal assessment of malaria transmission and control interventions was piloted in N'Zerekore and Macenta Prefectures, which each reported surprisingly low incidence of malaria during the peak transmission months during 2017 in holoendemic Forested Guinea. In each prefecture, epidemiological and entomological cross-sectional surveys were conducted in two sub-prefectures reporting high incidence and one sub-prefecture reporting low incidence. Investigators visited six health facilities and 356 households, tested 476 children, performed 14 larval breeding site transects, and conducted 12 nights of human landing catches during the 2-week investigation. Rapid diagnostic test positivity in the community sample of children under five ranged from 23% to 68% by subprefecture. Only 38% of persons with fever reported seeking care in the public health sector; underutilization was confirmed by verification of health facility and community healthcare worker (CHW) registries. High numbers of Anopheles mosquitoes were collected in human landing collections in N'Zerekore (38 per night in combined indoor and outdoor collections) and Macenta (87). Most of the detected breeding sites positive for Anopheles larvae (83%) were shallow roadside puddles. In the investigated prefectures, malaria rates remain high and the low reported incidence likely reflects low utilization of the public health-care sector. Strengthening the CHW program to rapidly identify and treat malaria cases and elimination of roadside puddles as part of routine cleanup campaigns should be considered. Systematic joint epidemiological/entomological investigations in areas reporting anomalous signals in routine data can allow control programs to respond with tailored local interventions.

TI  - Production of viable and infective inoculum of <i>Coccodiella miconiae</i> (Ascomycota: Phyllachoraceae) for the biological control of <i>Miconia calvescens</i>
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONTROL
AB  - Miconia calvescens is a small tree from the Neotropics that has become an aggressive invader of forest ecosystems in the Pacific. Classical biological control is the sole sustainable method for controlling such invasions. Among the numerous pathogens that have been found on miconia, the fungus Coccodiela miconiae stands out as a very promising biocontrol agent. It is often found in native situations causing a severe disease (yellow pustule) despite being commonly intensively attacked by a series of mycoparasites. However, the fungus is not easily manipulated and is difficult to preserve under controlled conditions because it is a strict biotroph. Elucidation of details of the biology of C. miconiae is needed to allow for its use in biological control. Herein results of a broad range of tests that were performed are presented. Such tests aimed at determining: (1) an efficient method for obtaining viable and infective ascospores; (2) effect of temperature, light and other factors on ascospores; (3) a protocol for plant inoculation. It was concluded that ascospores are efficiently obtained when mature stromata are detached from leaves and agitated in water for 3-4 h and that such suspension is infective when used immediately. Ascospore germination was favored by incubation at 25 degrees C under a 12 h of light/12 h dark regime. A protocol for inoculation of C miconiae is described. These findings indicate that it may now be possible to manipulate C. miconiae as a classical biocontrol agent. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - TEMPERATURE DATA FROM SATELLITE IMAGERY AND THE DISTRIBUTION OF SCHISTOSOMIASIS IN EGYPT
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Polar orbiting environmental satellites operated by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration acquire daytime and nighttime thermal infrared measurements of the earth's surface around the world at a spatial resolution of 1.1 km. Day-night pairs of this imagery from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) were processed to produce temperature maximum, temperature minimum, and diurnal temperature difference (dT) maps of the lower Nile River valley. Nile delta subsets of the dT maps for August 16, 1990 and February 14, 1991 were analyzed in detail. Values of dT at specific locations were derived using the median of 5 x 5 pixels centered on the latitude and longitude of 41 survey sites listed in 1935, 1983, and 1990 schistosomiasis surveys of the Nile Delta. A Spearman correlation coefficient matrix revealed an inverse relationship between site dT values for August 16, 1990 and February 14, 1991 and prevalence of Schistosoma mansoni in the 1935 and 1983 surveys. For S. haematobium, a positive association of site dT values and prevalence was seen for 1935 only. A significant association was observed between 1935 S. mansoni prevalence and that observed in 1983 and 1990; S. haematobium prevalence in 1935 was not correlated with the later surveys. The results suggest that AVHRR thermal difference maps reflect regional hydrologic conditions that can be used as a predictor of environmental risk of schistosomiasis for control program management.

TI  - The drought response of <i>Theobroma cacao</i> (cacao) and the regulation of genes involved in polyamine biosynthesis by drought and other stresses
T2  - PLANT PHYSIOLOGY AND BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Drought can negatively impact pod production despite the fact that cacao production usually occurs in tropical areas having high rainfall. Polyamines (PAs) have been associated with the response of plants to drought in addition to their roles in responses to many other stresses. The constitutive and drought inducible expression patterns of genes encoding enzymes involved in PA biosynthesis were determined: an ornithine decarboxylase (TcODC), an arginine decarboxylase (TcADC), an S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (TcSAMDC), a spermidine synthase (TcSPDS), and a spermine synthase (TcSPMS). Expression analysis using quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR (QPCR) results showed that the PA biosynthesis genes were expressed in all plant tissues examined. Constitutive expression of PA biosynthesis genes was generally highest in mature leaves and open flowers. Expression of TcODC, TcADC, and TcSAMDC was induced with the onset of drought and correlated with changes in stomatal conductance, photosynthesis, photosystem II efficiency, leaf water potential and altered emission of blue-green fluorescence from cacao leaves. Induction of TcSAMDC in leaves was most closely correlated with changes in water potential. The earliest measured responses to drought were enhanced expression of TcADC and TcSAMDC in roots along with decreases in stomatal conductance, photosynthesis, and photosystem II efficiency. Elevated levels of putrescine, spermidine, and spermine were detected in cacao leaves 13 days after the onset of drought. Expression of all five PA associated transcripts was enhanced (1.5-3-fold) in response to treatment with abscisic acid. TcODC and TcADC, were also responsive to mechanical wounding, infection by Phytophthora megakarya (a causal agent of black pod disease in cacao), the necrosis- and ethylene-inducing protein (Nep1) of Fusarium oxysporum, and flower abscission. TcSAMDC expression was responsive to all stresses except flower abscission. TcODC, although constitutively expressed at much lower levels than TcADC, TcSAMDC, TcSPDS, and TcSPMS, was highly inducible by the fungal protein Nep1 (135-fold) and the cacao pathogen Phytophthora megakarya (671-fold). The full length cDNA for ODC was cloned and characterized. Among the genes studied, TcODC, TcADC, and TcSAMDC were most sensitive to induction by drought in addition to other abiotic and biotic stresses. TcODC, TcADC, and TcSAMDC may share signal transduction pathways and/or the stress induced signal induction pathways may converge at these three genes leading to similar although not identical patterns of expression. It is possible altering PA levels in cacao will result in enhanced tolerance to multiple stresses including drought and disease as has been demonstrated in other crops.

TI  - A new focus of spotted fever caused by Rickettsia parkeri in Brazil
T2  - REVISTA DO INSTITUTO DE MEDICINA TROPICAL DE SAO PAULO
AB  - Spotted fever (SF) is a tick-borne zoonosis caused by bacteria of the genus Rickettsia. The disease varies in severity from mild clinical forms to severe cases. In Brazil, Rickettsia rickettsii SF is the most serious rickettsiosis and can result in death if not diagnosed and treated at the onset of symptoms. The SF mild form is caused by Rickettsia parkeri strain Atlantic Rainforest, and this etiological agent has been reported in the South, Southeast and Northeast regions of the country, in areas of preserved or little antropized Atlantic Rainforest. Amblyomma ovale is the proven vector and dogs are the hosts associated with the bioagent cycle. During a SF case investigation in Paraty municipality, Rio de Janeiro State, an Atlantic Rainforest biome area in Southeastern Brazil, the human pathogen R. parkeri strain Atlantic Rainforest was detected by PCR in a sample of human skin inoculation eschar and in a female A. ovale tick collected from a dog. These results expand the known area of occurrence of this mild form rickettsiosis in Brazil. In addition, the results of the present study indicate the importance of implementing programs to control canine ectoparasites and to raise awareness of the risks of infection, signs and symptoms of SF caused by R. parkeri strain Atlantic Rainforest.

TI  - Inadequate knowledge about snakebite envenoming symptoms and application of harmful first aid methods in the community in high snakebite incidence areas of Myanmar
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Introduction Every year millions of people in developing countries suffer from snakebite, causing a large number of deaths and long term complications. Prevention and appropriate first aid could reduce the incidence and improve the health outcomes for those who suffer bites. However, many communities where snakebite is a major issue suffer from a lack of information about prevention and first aid measures that a family or community member could take to prevent severe envenoming, complications and poor outcomes. Myanmar suffers from a high burden of snakebites with a large number of deaths. As part of a health services and community development program, a community survey was conducted to identify communities' knowledge about snakebite and their sequelae, and knowledge and practice about first aid and health services use.
   Method 4,276 rural residents of Kyaukse and Madaya townships in the Mandalay region were recruited by cluster sampling, involving random selection of 144 villages and random sampling of 30 households from each village. One adult member of each household was interviewed using a structured questionnaire.
   Results The incidence of snakebite was 116/100,000 people. Respondents reported 15 different types of snakes in the area, with Russell's Viper, Cobra and Green snakes as the most common. 88% of the people informed that working in the fields and forests was when most of the bites occur. A majority knew about snakebite prevention methods such as wearing long boots. However, only a few people knew about the specific symptoms caused by snakebites. Only 39% knew about the correct methods of first aid. More than 60% mentioned tourniquet as a first aid method, though this may cause significant complications such as ischaemia of the limb. 88% said that they would take a snakebite victim to a government hospital, and 58% mentioned availability of antivenom as the reason for doing this. At the same time, the majority mentioned that traditional methods existed for first aid and treatment and 25% mentioned at least one harmful traditional method as an effective measure that they might use.
   Conclusion The community is aware of snakebites as a major public health issue and know how to prevent them. However, the high incidence of snakebites point to lack of application of preventive methods. The community recognise the need for treatment with antivenom. However, inadequate knowledge about appropriate first aid methods, and a reliance on using tourniquets require a targeted education program. Existing knowledge in communities, albeit insufficient, provides a good starting point for mass media educational campaigns.
   Author summary Snakebite is a major public health problem, particularly in developing countries in the tropics, and every year millions of people suffer from snakebite causing a large number of deaths and long term complications. Communities' knowledge about snakebite prevention practices and appropriate basic first aid could reduce the number of snakebites and improve the health outcomes for those who suffer bites. However, many communities where snakebite is a major issue may lack information about prevention and first aid measures that a family or community member could take to prevent severe complications and poor outcomes. Myanmar suffers from a high burden of snakebites with a large number of deaths. We conducted a community survey in two townships to identify communities' knowledge about snakebite prevention, first aid and health services use. The survey informed that a large majority of people were aware that working in the fields and forests was when most of the bites occur. Similarly, a majority has the knowledge about snakebite prevention methods such as wearing long boots. However, the majority did not know about the correct methods of first aid, with many people mentioning tourniquet as a first aid method. While the community is aware of how to prevent snakebites, the fact that number of snakebites is high points to lack of application of those preventive methods. The inadequate knowledge about appropriate first aid methods with a reliance on using tourniquets informs about the need for public health education programs.

TI  - Medicinal plants of the genus Anthocleista-A review of their ethnobotany, phytochemistry and pharmacology
T2  - JOURNAL OF ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY
AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: The genus Anthodeista of the Gentianaceae family contains 14 species of trees and shrub-like plants distributed in tropical Africa, in Madagascar and on the Comoros. Traditionally, they are commonly used in the treatment of diabetes, hypertension, malaria, typhoid fever, obesity, diarrhea, dysentery, hyperprolactinemia, abdominal pain, ulcer, jaundice, asthma, hemorrhoids, hernia, cancer, wounds, chest pains, inflammations, rheumatism, STDs, infertility and skin diseases. They serve as an anthelmintic, laxative, diuretic and contraceptive. This review aims to provide for the first time a repository of ethnopharmacological information while critically evaluating the relation between the traditional medicinal uses, chemical constituents and pharmacological activities of the Anthocleista species so as to unveil opportunities for future research.
   Materials and methods: A search for relevant information on Anthocleista species was performed on scientific databases (Pubmed, Google Scholar, SciFinder, Web of Science, Scopus, PubChem and other web sources such as The Plant List, Kew Botanical Garden and PROTA) and books, PhD and MSc dissertations for un-published resources.
   Results: Out of the 14 species of Anthocleista, 6 have been reported in literature to be widely used in traditional medicine for the treatment of various ailments. The six species include: A. djalonensis, A. vogelii, A. nobilis, A. grandiflora, A. schweinfurthii, and A. liebrechtsiana. The chemical compounds isolated from Anthocleista species fall into the class of phytochemicals such as secoiridoids, nor-secoiridoids, xanthones, phytosterols, triterpenes, alkaloids, and others of which majority of the compounds were isolated from A. djalonensis and A. vogelii. The in vitro and in vivo pharmacological studies on the crude extracts, fractions and few isolated compounds of Anthocleista species showed antidiabetic, antiplasmodial, antimicrobial, hypotensive, spasmogenic, anti-obesity, antiulcerogenic, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antitrypanosomal, anthelmintic, fertility, diuretic and laxative activities which supports most of their uses in traditional medicine. However, the bulk of the studies where centered on the antidiabetic, antiplasmodial and antimicrobial activities of Anthocleista species, although the evidence of its antiplasmodial effect was not convincing enough due to the discrepancies between the in vitro and in vivo results.
   Conclusion: A. djalonensis and A. vogelii are potential antidiabetic and antibacterial agents. The antibacterial potency relates to infections or diseases caused by E con, S. typhi and S. aureus such as urinary tract infections, typhoid, diarrhea, skin diseases, and food poisoning. Pharmacological research on this genus is quite elementary and limited, thus, more advanced research is necessary to isolate and determine the activities of bioactive compounds in vitro and in vivo, establish their mechanisms of action and commence the process of clinical research.

TI  - A systematic review and meta-analysis of evidence for correlation between molecular markers of parasite resistance and treatment outcome in falciparum malaria
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
AB  - Background: An assessment of the correlation between anti-malarial treatment outcome and molecular markers would improve the early detection and monitoring of drug resistance by Plasmodium falciparum. The purpose of this systematic review was to determine the risk of treatment failure associated with specific polymorphisms in the parasite genome or gene copy number.
   Methods: Clinical studies of non-severe malaria reporting on target genetic markers (SNPs for pfmdr1, pfcrt, dhfr, dhps, gene copy number for pfmdr1) providing complete information on inclusion criteria, outcome, follow up and genotyping, were included. Three investigators independently extracted data from articles.
   Results were stratified by gene, codon, drug and duration of follow-up. For each study and aggregate data the random effect odds ratio (OR) with 95% CIs was estimated and presented as Forest plots. An OR with a lower 95th confidence interval > 1 was considered consistent with a failure being associated to a given gene mutation. Results: 92 studies were eligible among the selection from computerized search, with information on pfcrt (25/159 studies), pfmdr1 (29/236 studies), dhfr (18/373 studies), dhps (20/195 studies). The risk of therapeutic failure after chloroquine was increased by the presence of pfcrt K76T (Day 28, OR = 7.2 [95% CI: 4.5-11.5]), pfmdr1 N86Y was associated with both chloroquine (Day 28, OR = 1.8 [95% CI: 1.3-2.4]) and amodiaquine failures (OR = 5.4 [95% CI: 2.6-11.3, p < 0.001]). For sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine the dhfr single (S108N) (Day 28, OR = 3.5 [95% CI: 1.9-6.3]) and triple mutants (S108N, N51I, C59R) (Day 28, OR = 3.1 [95% CI: 2.0-4.9]) and dhfr-dhps quintuple mutants (Day 28, OR = 5.2 [95% CI: 3.2-8.8]) also increased the risk of treatment failure. Increased pfmdr1 copy number was correlated with treatment failure following mefloquine (OR = 8.6 [95% CI: 3.3-22.9]).
   Conclusion: When applying the selection procedure for comparative analysis, few studies fulfilled all inclusion criteria compared to the large number of papers identified, but heterogeneity was limited. Genetic molecular markers were related to an increased risk of therapeutic failure. Guidelines are discussed and a checklist for further studies is proposed.

TI  - Effectiveness of causality-based predictor selection for statistical downscaling: a case study of rainfall in an Ecuadorian Andes basin
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
AB  - Downscaling aims to take large-scale information and map it to smaller scales to reproduce local climate signals. An essential step in implementing a parsimonious downscaling model is the selection of a subset of relevant predictors that increase the simulation accuracy. According to relevant literature, predictive models that use predictors chosen through causality methods, not widely used in downscaling, are more interpretable and robust. Characteristics that do not necessarily pursue the selection methods are commonly used in machine learning (ML), where the primary objective is to maximize accuracy. This study then explores whether the improvement in interpretability and robustness of models that use causally selected predictors is not achieved at the expense of poor downscaling performance in terms of simulation accuracy. To this end, one set of three methods based on causality and one set of four standard predictor selection methods used in ML are compared, centered on the downscaling performance of rainfall in an Ecuadorian Andes basin. One causality-based selection method is based on Granger causality (GC), and two are based on a constraint-based algorithm for structure learning, namely the Peter and Clark algorithm (PCalg) and the based on PCalg and the momentary conditional independence (PCMCI). Regarding the methods used in ML, one is based on the variance of the predictors (variance threshold), two are based on univariate statistical tests (F test and mutual information), and one is based on the recursive elimination of predictors (RFE) according to their contribution to the prediction model. The number of methods in each set results from those that are considered standard in many ML libraries or have been used for regression or climatology (causality-based). The selected predictors are used to train statistical downscaling models based on the random forest and support vector machine learning algorithms to assess their performance and rank the selection methods. Among the most remarkable findings, the methods based on causality show a robust selection. For instance, the causality-based methods selected 53 different predictors in one of the considered stations, while the ML-based methods selected 73 for downscaling models with similar performance. Furthermore, when the predictors used in the best performing downscaling models are analyzed, it is shown that the different selection methods based on causality tend to choose a subset of predictors that do not differ greatly, contrary to the methods based on machine learning. This evidences a more concise selection of the causality-based methods. Finally, the evaluation metrics of the downscaling models showed that the best selection method is RFE, but the following best were consistently those based on causality (mainly PCMCI). The study evidences no significant performance detriment when using the causally selected predictors.

TI  - <i>Onchocerca volvulus</i> transmission in the Mbam valley of Cameroon following 16 years of annual community-directed treatment with ivermectin, and the description of a new cytotype of <i>Simulium squamosum</i>
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
AB  - Background: The onchocerciasis focus surrounding the lower Mbam and Sanaga rivers, where Onchocerca volvulus is transmitted by Simulium damnosum s.l. (Diptera: Simuliidae), was historically the largest in the southern regions of Cameroon. Annual community- directed treatment with ivermectin (CDTI) has been taking place since 2000, but recent studies have shown that new infections are occurring in children. We aimed to investigate blackfly biting and O. volvulus transmission rates along the lower Mbam river 16 years after the formal onset of annual CDTI.
   Methods: Black flies were collected for three consecutive days each month between July 2016 and June 2017 at two riverside villages and two inland sites situated 4.9 km and 7.9 km from the riverside. Specimens collected at each site were dissected on one of the three collection days each month to estimate parity rates and O. volvulus infection rates, while the remaining samples were preserved for pool screening. Results: In total, 93,573 S. damnosum s.l. black flies were recorded biting humans and 9281 were dissected. Annual biting rates of up to 606,370 were estimated at the riverside, decreasing to 20,540 at 7.9 km, while, based on dissections, annual transmission potentials of up to 4488 were estimated at the riverside, decreasing to 102 and 0 at 4.9 km and 7.9 km, respectively. However, pool screening showed evidence of infection in black flies at the furthest distance from the river.
   Results of both methods demonstrated the percentage of infective flies to be relatively low (0.100.36%), but above the WHO threshold for interruption of transmission. In addition, a small number of larvae collected during the dry season revealed the presence of Simulium squamosum E. This is the first time S. squamosum E has been found east of Lake Volta in Ghana, but our material was chromosomally distinctive, and we call it S. squamosum E2.
   Conclusions: Relatively low O. volvulus infection rates appear to be offset by extremely high densities of biting black flies which are sustaining transmission along the banks of the lower Mbam river.

TI  - Epidemiology of capybara-associated Brazilian spotted fever
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Author summary Brazilian spotted fever (BSF), caused by the bacterium Rickettsia rickettsii, is the deadliest tick-borne disease of the New World. In southeastern Brazil, where 489 patients succumbed to the disease from 2001 to 2018, R. rickettsii is transmitted to humans mainly by the tick Amblyomma sculptum, which uses the capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) as its main host. During 2015-2019, we captured capybaras and ticks in seven highly anthropic areas of Sao Paulo state (three endemic and four nonendemic for BSF) and in two natural areas of the Pantanal biome. The BSF-endemic areas were characterized by much higher tick burdens on both capybaras and in the environment, with a predominance of Amblyomma sculptum. In the BSF-nonendemic areas, another tick species, Amblyomma dubitatum, outnumbered A. sculptum. In the natural areas, six tick species were found; however, with much lower numbers than in the anthropic areas. The BSF-endemic areas were characterized by overgrowth populations of A. sculptum that were sustained chiefly by capybaras, and decreased populations of A. dubitatum. Results of this study support the idea that any intervention resulting in a drastic reduction of the A. sculptum population shall eliminate the R. rickettsii infection from the tick population, and consequently, prevent new BSF cases.
   Background Brazilian spotted fever (BSF), caused by the bacterium Rickettsia rickettsii, has been associated with the transmission by the tick Amblyomma sculptum, and one of its main hosts, the capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris). Methods During 2015-2019, we captured capybaras and ticks in seven highly anthropic areas of Sao Paulo state (three endemic and four nonendemic for BSF) and in two natural areas of the Pantanal biome, all with established populations of capybaras. Results The BSF-endemic areas were characterized by much higher tick burdens on both capybaras and in the environment, when compared to the BSF-nonendemic areas. Only two tick species (A. sculptum and Amblyomma dubitatum) were found in the anthropic areas; however, with a great predominance of A. sculptum (approximate to 90% of all ticks) in the endemic areas, in contrast to a slight predominance of A. dubitatum (approximate to 60%) in the nonendemic areas. Tick species richness was higher in the natural areas, where six species were found, albeit with a predominance of A. sculptum (approximate to 95% of all ticks) and environmental tick burdens much lower than in the anthropic areas. The BSF-endemic areas were characterized by overgrowth populations of A. sculptum that were sustained chiefly by capybaras, and decreased populations of A. dubitatum. In contrast, the BSF-nonendemic areas with landscape similar to the endemic areas differed by having lower tick burdens and a slight predominance of A. dubitatum over A.sculptum, both sustained chiefly by capybaras. While multiple medium- to large-sized mammals have been incriminated as important hosts for A. sculptum in the natural areas, the capybara was the only important host for this tick in the anthropic areas. Conclusions The uneven distribution of R. rickettsii infection among A. sculptum populations in highly anthropic areas of Sao Paulo state could be related to the tick population size and its proportion to sympatric A. dubitatum populations.

TI  - Low levels of inorganic copper impair reproduction parameters in Oreochromis <i>niloticus</i> after chronic exposure
T2  - AQUACULTURE
AB  - Copper (Cu) is an essential metal utilized in aquaculture activities for both nutritional and disease control. Conversely, this metal can present a risk of exposure to biota depending on the used concentration, but data are still scarce and studies to establish the real risk of copper exposure to fish even in aquaculture activities are welcome. To evaluate a set of environmentally realistic doses of inorganic copper and so the potential risk of exposure to reproduction, Oreochromis niloticus were orally exposed to 0.1, 1.0 or 10.0 mg Cu.kg(-1) body weight for 60 days (one dose each 10 days). Parameters regarding sperm quality, including viability, membrane integrity, mitochondrial functionality, apoptosis, lipid peroxidation, protein carbonylation, DNA integrity and motility were considered as signs of reproductive impairment. Additionally, as copper is also described as a prooxidant metal, we investigated the oxidative balance in liver (Non-protein reduced thiols concentrations-GSH, superoxide dismutase activity-SOD, lipid peroxidation-LPO, protein carbonylation-PCO and glutathione S-transferase-GST activity). Fishes exposed to copper showed poor sperm quality due to the observed reduced motility and motility period. Induced mitochondrial dysfunction, lipid peroxidation and apoptosis in germ cells, as well as DNA fragmentation confirms the high impairment of Cu to reproduction of O. niloticus exposed to copper in realistic doses. Exposure to the highest dose used in this experiment led to oxidative imbalance in liver, corroborating the deleterious effects of this metal to biological systems. These findings strongly suggest that even under very low Cu doses, or realistic doses as utilized in aquaculture activities, the metal may negatively affect O. niloticus reproduction, probably decreasing the success of aquaculture activities.

TI  - Applications of COSMIC to meteorology and climate
T2  - TERRESTRIAL ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC SCIENCES
AB  - The GPS/MET (Global Positioning System/Meteorology, Ware et al. 1996) project demonstrated atmospheric limb sounding from low-earth-orbit (LEO) with high vertical resolution, high accuracy, and global coverage in all weather. Based on the success and scientific results of GPS/MET, Taiwan's National Space Program Office (NSPO), the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR), the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), the University of Texas at Austin, the University of Arizona, Florida State University and other partners in the university community are developing COSMIC (Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere and Climate), a follow-on project for weather and climate research, climate monitoring, space weather, and geodetic science. COSMIC plans to launch eight LEO satellites in 2004. Each COSMIC satellite will retrieve about 500 daily profiles of key ionospheric and atmospheric properties from the tracked GPS radio-signals as they are occulted behind the Earth limb. The constellation will provide frequent global snapshots of the atmosphere and ionosphere with about 4000 daily soundings.
   This paper discusses some of the applications of COSMIC data for meteorology, including polar meteorology, numerical weather prediction (NWP), and climate. Applications to ionospheric research including space weather and geodesy are described elsewhere in this issue of TAO.
   In meteorology COSMIC will provide high vertical resolution temperature, pressure and water vapor information for a variety of atmospheric process studies and improve the forecast accuracy of numerical weather prediction models. The COSMIC data set will allow investigation of the global water vapor distribution and map the atmospheric flow of water vapor that is so crucial for understanding and predicting weather and climate. The data set will provide accurate geopotential heights, enable the detection of gravity waves from the upper troposphere to the stratosphere, reveal the height and shape of the tropopause globally with unprecedented accuracy, support the investigation of fronts and other baroclinic structures, and improve our understanding of tropopause-stratosphere exchange processes.
   COSMIC data will complement other observing systems and improve global weather analyses, particularly over the oceans and polar regions, and NWP forecasts made from these analyses. Through assimilation in numerical models, COSMIC data will improve the resolution and accuracy of the global temperature, pressure and water vapor fields, and through the model's dynamical and physical adjustment mechanisms, the wind fields as well. These improved analyses and forecasts will provide significant benefits to aviation and other industries.
   For climate research and monitoring COSMIC will provide an accurate global thermometer that will monitor Earth's atmosphere In all weather with unprecedented long-term stability, resolution, coverage, and accuracy. COSMIC will provide a data set for the detection of climate variability and change, the separation of natural and anthropogenic causes, the calibration of other satellite observing systems and the verification and improvement of climate models. COSMIC will contribute to studies of El Nino events especially in remote oceanic regions, and it will enable scientists to monitor the response of the global atmosphere to regional events such as volcanic eruptions, the Kuwait oil fires, or the recent Indonesian and Mexican forest fires. Upper-tropospheric refractivity data from COSMIC may shed new light on the controversy over the role that tropical convection plays in climate feedback. Global water vapor fields derived with the use of COSMIC data will provide new insights into the global hydrologic cycle.

TI  - Monitoring relative abundance index and age ratios of wild boar (<i>Sus scrofa</i>) in small scale population in Gifu prefecture, Japan during classical swine fever outbreak
T2  - JOURNAL OF VETERINARY MEDICAL SCIENCE
AB  - Although the first cases of classical swine fever were reported in 2018, no studies have explored this impact on wild boar populations in Japan. Comparing the relative abundance indices and age ratios in the wild boar population before and after the outbreak, we investigated the impact of classical swine fever virus on wild boar population dynamics in August 2017-December 2019. Relative abundance indices declined from 2017 to 2019 drastically, while there were no significant differences in age ratios throughout the study period. Consequently, wildlife managers should consider that wild boars continue to contract classical swine fever virus, and they should intensively implement countermeasures in agricultural lands and in pig farms, in addition to wild boar population management.

TI  - Recent Discoveries of New Hantaviruses Widen Their Range and Question Their Origins
T2  - ANIMAL BIODIVERSITY AND EMERGING DISEASES: PREDICTION AND PREVENTION
CP  - 9th Biennial Conference on Animal Biodiversity and Emerging Diseases - Prediction and Prevention
AB  - Hantaviruses belong to the Bunyaviridae family. While usually hosted by wild mammals, they are potentially pathogenic for humans, and several serologically distinct groups associated with different syndromes have been identified. Yet, investigations have mostly been conducted where human infections by hantaviruses constitute a real and well-identified public health problem, i.e., the holarctic and neotropical areas. Some hantaviruses have also been described from a Suncus murinus in India and a Bandicota indica in Thailand. In addition, recent investigations in Cambodia revealed new Hantavirus types. More recently, two new Hantavirus species were described: Sangassou from a Hylomyscus simus, and Tanganya from a Crocidura theresae, both from Africa (Guinea), thus strongly questioning the current views about geographic range, evolution, and epidemiology of hantaviruses. In such a framework, we have conducted a survey of Hantavirus diversity in Southeast Asia which allows us to isolate the Thailand virus and address questions about the taxonomy of their rodent hosts. Here we present a molecular analysis of representatives of all currently known Hantavirus species, thus allowing the comparison between the newly described ones with a large range sample of rodent hantaviruses. Our results clearly point to the presence of a particular lineage of hantaviruses in Southeast Asia. It also strongly suggests that new viruses, additional mammalian hosts and different related syndromes in humans are likely to be discovered in the near future, particularly in Southeast Asia and in Africa, where Muridae rodents are highly diversified. Furthermore, additional work is also urgently needed to investigate the hantaviruses associated with Crociduridae and Soricidae.

TI  - High diversity and sharing of strongylid nematodes in humans and great apes co-habiting an unprotected area in Cameroon
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Rapid increases in human populations and environmental changes of past decades have led to changes in rates of contact and spatial overlap with wildlife. Together with other historical, social and environmental processes, this has significantly contributed to pathogen transmission in both directions, especially between humans and non-human primates, whose close phylogenetic relationship facilitates cross-infections. Using high-throughput amplicon sequencing, we studied strongylid communities in sympatric western lowland gorillas, central chimpanzees and humans co-occurring in an unprotected area in the northern periphery of the Dja Faunal Reserve, Cameroon. At the genus level, we classified 65 strongylid ITS-2 amplicon sequencing variants (ASVs) in humans and great apes. Great apes exhibited higher strongylid diversity than humans. Necator and Oesophagostomum were the most prevalent genera, and we commonly observed mixed infections of more than one strongylid species. Human strongylid communities were dominated by the human hookworm N. americanus, while great apes were mainly infected with N. gorillae, O. stephanostomum and trichostrongylids. We were also able to detect rare strongylid taxa (such as Ancylostoma and Ternidens). We detected eight ASVs shared between humans and great apes (four N. americanus variants, two N. gorillae variants, one O. stephanostomum type I and one Trichostrongylus sp. type II variant). Our results show that knowledge of strongylid communities in primates, including humans, is still limited. Sharing the same habitat, especially outside protected areas (where access to the forest is not restricted), can enable mutual parasite exchange and can even override host phylogeny or conserved patterns. Such studies are critical for assessing the threats posed to all hosts by increasing human-wildlife spatial overlap. In this study, the term "contact" refers to physical contact, while "spatial overlap" refers to environmental contact.

TI  - Competitiveness and survival of two strains of <i>Glossina palpalis gambiensis</i> in an urban area of Senegal
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   In the Niayes area, located in the west of Senegal, only one tsetse species, Glossina palpalis gambiensis Vanderplank (Diptera: Glossinidae) was present. The Government of Senegal initiated and implemented an elimination programme in this area that included a sterile insect technique (SIT) component. The G. p. gambiensis strain (BKF) mass-reared at the Centre International de Recherche-De A veloppement sur l'Elevage en zone Subhumide (CIR-DES) in Burkina Faso was used for the SIT component.
   Methodology/principal findings
   Studies conducted in 2011 in four localities in the Niayes area (Pout, Se A bikotane, Diacksao Peul and the Parc de Hann) showed that the BKF strain demonstrated inferior survival in the ecosystem of the Parc de Hann, a forested area in the city centre of the capital Dakar. Therefore, G. p. gambiensis flies from the Niayes area (SEN strain) were colonized. Here we compared the competitiveness and survival of the two strains (BKF and SEN) in the Parc de Hann. Released sterile males of the SEN colony showed a daily mortality rate of 0.08 (SD 0.08) as compared with 0.14 (SD 0.08) for the BKF flies but the difference was not significant (p-value = 0.14). However, the competitiveness of the SEN males was lower (0.14 (SD 0.10)) as compared with that of the BKF males (0.76 (SD 0.11)) (p-value < 10(-3)).
   Conclusions/significance
   Based on the results of this study, it can be concluded that the BKF strain will remain the main strain to be used in the elimination programme. Despite the slightly longer survival of the SEN males in the Parc de Hann, the superior competitiveness of the BKF males is deemed more important for the SIT component, as their shorter survival rates can be easily compensated for by more frequent fly releases.

TI  - Determinants of Visceral Leishmaniasis: A Case-Control Study in Gedaref State, Sudan
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   Improving knowledge on local determinants of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is crucial to guide the development of relevant control strategies. This study aimed to identify individual and household level determinants of primary VL in 24 highly endemic villages of Tabarak Allah hospital's catchment area, Gedaref State, Sudan.
   Methods
   From September 2012 to July 2013, in an unmatched case-control design, 198 patients with primary VL were compared to 801 controls free of VL symptoms and with a negative VL rapid test. Using random spatial sampling, controls were selected with a distribution of age, sex and village of residence proportionate to the distribution of the target population. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire.
   Results
   Children and men were at higher risk of VL. Reporting VL patient(s) in the household in the previous year was the strongest VL risk factor. In a multivariate analysis, VL risk increased with household size, sleep location (outside the yard, not in the farm), evening outdoor activities in the rainy season (playing, watching TV, radio listening), use of ground nut oil as animal repellent and of smoke of Acacia seyal as indoor repellent, presence of dogs in the yard at night, Acacia nilotica in the yard's immediate surroundings and of a forest at eye range. VL risk appeared to decrease with the use of drinking water sources other than the village water tank, a buffer distance from the adjacent house yard, and with the presence of animals other than dogs in the yard at night. In contrast with previous studies, housing factors, mosquito-net use, black cotton soil, ethnicity, socioeconomic index, presence of Balanites aegyptica and Azadirachta indica in the yard were not independent VL determinants.
   Discussion and conclusion
   Although these results do not provide evidence of causality, they provide useful suggestions for guiding further intervention studies on VL preventive measures.

TI  - Scorpions trapped in amber: a remarkable window on their evolution over time from the Mesozoic period to present days
T2  - JOURNAL OF VENOMOUS ANIMALS AND TOXINS INCLUDING TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - This synoptic review aims to bring some general information on fossil scorpions, namely those trapped in amber - fossilized resin - ranging from Lower Cretaceous through the Palaeocene and up to the Miocene. The question to be addressed is how the study of these fossils can be connected with possible present scorpionism problems. A precise knowledge of these ancient lineages provides information about the evolution of extant lineages, including the buthoids, which contain most known noxious species. Among the Arthropods found trapped in amber, scorpions are considered rare. A limited number of elements have been described from the Late Tertiary Dominican and Mexican amber, while the most ancient Tertiary amber from the Baltic region produced more consistent results in the last 30 years, primarily focusing on a single limited lineage. Contrarily, the Cretaceous amber from Myanmar, also called Burmite, has yielded and continues to yield a significant number of results represented by several distinct lineages, which attest to the considerable degree of diversity that existed in the Burmese amber-producing forests. As in my previous similar contributions to this journal, the content of this note is primarily addressed to non-specialists whose research embraces scorpions in various fields such as venom toxins and public health. An overview knowledge of at least some fossil lineages can eventually help to clarify why some extant elements associated with the buthoids represent dangerous species while others are not noxious.

TI  - Transcriptome analysis of the spider Phonotimpus pennimani reveals novel toxin transcripts
T2  - JOURNAL OF VENOMOUS ANIMALS AND TOXINS INCLUDING TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background: Phonotimpus pennimani (Araneae, Phrurolithidae) is a small-sized (3-5 mm) spider endemic to the Tacana volcano in Chiapas, Mexico, where it is found in soil litter of cloud forests and coffee plantations. Its venom composition has so far not been investigated, partly because it is not a species of medical significance. However, it does have an important impact on the arthropod populations of its natural habitat.Methods: Specimens were collected in Southeastern Mexico (Chiapas) and identified taxonomically by morphological characteristics. A partial sequence from the mitochondrial gene coxI was amplified. Sequencing on the Illumina platform of a transcriptome library constructed from 12 adult specimens revealed 25 toxin or toxin-like genes. Transcripts were validated (RT-qPCR) by assessing the differential expression of the toxin-like PpenTox1 transcript and normalising with housekeeping genes.Results: Analysis of the coxI-gene revealed a similarity to other species of the family Phrurolithidae. Transcriptome analysis also revealed similarity with venom components of species from the families Ctenidae, Lycosidae, and Sicariidae. Expression of the toxin-like PpenTox1 gene was different for each developmental stage (juvenile or adult) and also for both sexes (female or male). Additionally, a partial sequence was obtained for the toxin-like PpenTox1 from DNA.Conclusion: Data from the amplification of the mitochondrial coxI gene confirmed that P. pennimani belongs to the family Phrurolithidae. New genes and transcripts coding for venom components were identified.

TI  - Carbon storage of Mediterranean grasslands
T2  - ANALES DEL JARDIN BOTANICO DE MADRID
AB  - Secondary grasslands are one of the most common vegetation types worldwide. In Europe, and in the Mediterranean basin, human activities have transformed many woodlands into secondary grasslands. Despite their recognized role in the global carbon cycle, very few data are available for estimating the biomass of Mediterranean grasslands. We developed linear regression models in order to predict the biomass of two native Mediterranean grasses (Ampelodesmos mauritanicus and Hyparrhenia hirta) and an invasive alien grass (Pennisetum setaceum). Ampelodesmos mauritanicus is very common throughout the Mediterranean basin, mostly on north-facing slopes, H. hirta characterizes thermo-xeric grasslands, while P. setaceum is an alien species that is rapidly spreading along coastal areas. The measured morphometric attributes of individual plants as potential predictors were considered. The validation results corroborate the ability of the established models to predict above ground and total biomass of A. mauritanicus and P. setaceum. We also evaluated the total biomass per hectare for each species. The highest biomass per hectare was found for A. mauritanicus, whereas biomass was higher for H. hirta than for P. setaceum. The replacement of H. hirta by P. setaceum may reduce the total carbon storage in the ecosystem; however, P. setaceum allocates more resources to the roots, thus increasing the more stable and durable pool of carbon in grasslands.

TI  - Ability of Field Populations of <i>Coptotermes</i> spp., <i>Reticulitermes flavipes</i>, and <i>Mastotermes darwiniensis</i> (Isoptera: Rhinotermitidae; Mastotermitidae) to Damage Plastic Cable Sheathings
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - A comparative field study was conducted to evaluate the ability of subterranean termites to damage a set of four different plastic materials (cable sheathings) exposed below- and above-ground. Eight pest species from six countries were included, viz., Coptotermes formosanus (Shiraki) in China, Japan, and the United States; Coptotermes gestroi (Wasmann) in Thailand and Malaysia; Coptotermes curvignathus (Holmgren) and Coptotermes kalshoveni (Kemner) in Malaysia; Coptotermes acinaciformis (Froggatt) with two forms of the species complex and Mastotermes darwiniensis (Froggatt) in Australia; and Reticulitermes flavipes (Kollar) in the United States. Termite species were separated into four tiers relative to decreasing ability to damage plastics. The first tier, most damaging, included C. acinaciformis, mound-building form, and M. darwiniensis, both from tropical Australia. The second tier included C. acinaciformis, tree-nesting form, from temperate Australia and C. kalshoveni from Southeast Asia. The third tier included C. curvignathus and C. gestroi from Southeast Asia and C. formosanus from China, Japan, and the United States, whereas the fourth tier included only R. flavipes, which caused no damage. A consequence of these results is that plastics considered resistant to termite damage in some locations will not be so in others because of differences in the termite fauna, for example, resistant plastics from the United States and Japan will require further testing in Southeast Asia and Australia. However, plastics considered resistant in Australia will be resistant in all other locations.

TI  - Effects of earthworms on plant growth: patterns and perspectives
T2  - PEDOBIOLOGIA
CP  - 7th International Symposium on Earthworm Ecology (ISEE7)
AB  - A total of 67 studies were located in which the response of plants to presence of earthworms was investigated. The number of studies increased strongly during the last decade. in most of the studies (79%) shoot biomass of plants significanty increased in the presence of earthworms. However, knowledge on effects of earthworms on plant growth is very biased; most studies investigated crop plants, particularly cereals, and pastures; very little is known on plant species in more natural communities. Recently, interest in tropical plant species has increased considerably, however, the studies have considered almost exclusively agricultural plant species. Generally, experiments focused on the response of plant shoots but 45% of the studies also considered roots. Most of the studies investigated European earthworms (Lumbricidae); very little is known on other earthworm species. Some early studies indicated that earthworms affect the composition of plant communities but only very recently has it been documented that earthworms affect plant competition. However, there is virtually no information on how earthworms affect plant performance in detail including fitness parameters such as flowering and seed production. It has been realized recently that earthworms not only modify plant growth and vegetation structure but also the susceptability of plants to herbivores. Herbivore performance might be stimulated but also reduced due to the presence of earthworms. Furthermore, earthworms function as subsidiary food resources to generalist predators when herbivore prey is scarce. The complex indirect interactions between earthworms and the aboveground system deserve further investigation in both natural and agricultural ecosystems. The imperative for future research is adopting an ecological rather than an agricultural perspective in studying earthworm-plant interrelationships and viewing earthworms as driving factors of the aboveground food web. It is suggested that studies on earthworm-plant interactions may contribute significantly to a more comprehensive understanding of terrestrial ecosystems and to the development of more environmentally friendly agricultural practices.

Accurate surveys of intestinal parasites in children inform empirical treatment regimens and can assess the impact of school based drug treatment programmes. There is limited information on this topic in Cambodia.
   Methods
   In a prospective study of intestinal parasites in symptomatic children attending Angkor Hospital for Children, Siem Reap, Cambodia, April-June 2012, samples were examined by microscopy of a direct and concentrated fecal sample. Two culture methods for hookworm and Strongyloides stercoralis were employed when sufficient sample was received. Demographic, clinical and epidemiological data were collected.
   Principal Findings
   We studied 970 samples from 865 children. The median (inter-quartile range) age of the children was 5.4 (1.9-9.2) years, 54% were male. The proportion of children with abdominal pain was 66.8%, diarrhea 34.9%, anemia 12.7% and malnutrition 7.4%. 458 parasitic infections were detected in 340 (39.3%) children. The most common parasites using all methods of detection were hookworm (14.3%), Strongyloides stercoralis (11.6%) and Giardia lamblia (11.2%). Giardia lamblia was most common in children aged 1-5 years, hookworm and Strongyloides stercoralis were more common with increasing age. Hookworm, Strongloides stercoralis and Giardia lamblia were more common in children living outside of Siem Reap town. In a multivariate logistic regression increasing age was associated with all three infections, defecating in the forest for hookworm infection, the presence of cattle for S. stercoralis and not using soap for handwashing for G. lamblia.
   Conclusions/Significance
   This study confirms the importance of intestinal parasitic infections in symptomatic Cambodian children and the need for adequate facilities for laboratory diagnosis together with education to improve personal hygiene and sanitation.

TI  - Epidemiological profile of snakebites in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 2001-2006
T2  - JOURNAL OF VENOMOUS ANIMALS AND TOXINS INCLUDING TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - All snakebites registered in Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil, between 2001 and 2006 were analyzed. Of these, the snake species involved was identified in 2,431 cases, most of which were caused by Bothrops (2,347). Most victims were male (78.4%) and the age group most frequently attacked was between 20 and 39 years (38.4%). As for severity, 1,118 (45.9%) were classified as minor, 748 (30.7%) as moderate, and 209 (8.6%) as severe. Progression towards complete cure occurred in 1,567 patients; 39 had sequelae; three died; and clinical outcomes were not monitored in 822 cases. The time between bite and first medical attention was less than three hours in 74.6% of cases. Most occurred in municipalities with vast areas of preserved Atlantic Forest: Angra dos Reis (208), Rio de Janeiro (197), Parati (186), Teresopolis (134), and Petropolis (110). Accident frequency was highest between November and April, in which the daily average is practically twice that observed in other months. Although results show that Rio de Janeiro state has a good level of medical care, it could be improved by creating multidisciplinary teams that include doctors, biologists, and nurses. The Vital Network for Brazil helps to promote a stimulating environment for this type of training, with both traditional courses and distance learning. Training hours must be increased to improve the skills of professionals responsible for victim care.

TI  - Antibody to Sin Nombre virus in rodents associated with peridomestic habitats in west central Montana
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Most human cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome are acquired in the peridomestic environment, yet studies of the ecology and infection dynamics in the reservoir host, the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), have focused on sylvan populations. We describe a 2.5-year study of hantavirus infection in rodents associated with peridomestic habitats in west central Montana. Antibodies reactive with Sin Nombre virus (SNV) were found in five species. Overall SNV antibody prevalence was highest among deer mice (25% of individuals tested). As has been demonstrated for sylvan populations, the antibody-positive component of the deer mouse population consisted of a higher proportion of adults and males. However, the prevalence of antibodies to SNV was higher in this study than has been reported in most sylvan studies. The average monthly proportion of deer mouse blood samples with antibodies to SNV ranged from approximately 20% to 25% and was highest in the late spring/early summer. The higher SNV antibody prevalence in peridomestic compared with sylvan settings may be related to behavioral differences and/or potentially longer survival of the virus deposited inside buildings. Peridomestic settings presented higher concentrations of virus and may present a higher risk of human infection than do sylvan settings.

TI  - Epigenetically regulated lncRNAs dissect the intratumoural heterogeneity and facilitate immune evasion of glioblastomas
T2  - THERANOSTICS
AB  - Background: Glioblastomas are the most common and malignant central nervous system (CNS) tumors that occupied a highly heterogeneous tumor microenvironment (TIME). Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), whose expression can be modified by DNA methylation, are emerging as critical regulators in the immune system. However, knowledge about the epigenetic changes in lncRNAs and their contribution to the immune heterogeneity of glioma is still lacking.Methods: In this study, we integrated paired methylome and transcriptome datasets of glioblastomas and identified 2 robust immune subtypes based on lncRNA methylation features. The immune characteristics of glioma subtypes were compared. Furthermore, immune-related lncRNAs were identified and their relationships with immune evasion were evaluated.Results: Glioma immunophenotypes exhibited distinct immune-related characteristics as well as clinical and epigenetic features. 149 epigenetically regulated (ER) lncRNAs were recognized that possessed inverse variation in epigenetic and transcriptional levels between glioma subtypes. Immune-related lncRNAs were further identified through the investigation of their correlation with immune cell infiltrations and immune-related pathways. In particular, the 'Hot' glioma subtype with higher immunoactivity while a worse survival outcome was found to character immune evasion features. We finally prioritized candidate ER lncRNAs associated with immune evasion markers and response to glioma immunotherapy. Among them, CD109-AS1 and LINC02447 were validated as novel immunoevasive biomarkers for glioma through in vitro experiments. Conclusion: In summary, our study systematically reveals the crosstalk among DNA methylation, lncRNA, and immune regulation in glioblastomas, and will facilitate the development of epigenetic immunotherapy approaches.

TI  - A boom-bust phylum? Ecological and evolutionary consequences of density variations in echinoderms
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS
AB  - Echinoderms play a key role in structuring many marine ecosystems and are notorious for large population density variations in so-called "outbreak'' or "dieoff'' events. In a review of this phenomenon, we assess the causal factors and ecological and evolutionary consequences. We identified 28 species (6 Asteroidea, 8 Echinoidea, 10 Holothuroidea, 4 Ophiuroidea) that exhibit large (more than two population doublings or halvings) population density changes. Three generalized patterns were identified and named for exemplary species: (1) rapid decreases followed by no or slow recovery (Diadema-Paracentrotus Model), (2), rapid increase and apparent stability at a new population density (Amperima-Amphiura Model), and (3) population density. fluctuations (Acanthaster-Asterias Model). Echinoderms identified were distributed from the shallow intertidal to the deep sea, and from tropical to temperate regions. In most cases, significant impacts on the respective ecosystems were observed. The most striking similarity among all species identified was possession of the ancestral-type planktotrophic larva. This larval type was significantly overrepresented in species identified within the Asteroidea, Echinoidea, Holothuroidea, and for the combined data set. We suggest three main factors that render a life history with planktotrophic larvae a high-risk-high-gain strategy: (1) a strong nonlinear dependency of larval production on adult densities (Allee effects), (2) a low potential for compensatory feedback mechanisms, and (3) an uncoupling of larval and adult ecology. The alternative (derived) lecithotrophic larva occurs in 68% of recent echinoderm species, suggesting an evolutionary trend toward this larval type. Lecithotrophic development represents a more buffered life history because compensatory feedback between adult densities and larval output is likely to be more efficient. For lecithotrophic developers, direct nutritive coupling from adult to larva to the early benthic juvenile provides a buffer against starvation. Lecithotrophic larvae are independent of the vagaries of planktonic food supply, and their short planktonic duration may promote local recruitment. Anthropogenic influences contributed to the population density variations in most cases, including increased primary productivity through eutrophication or global change, disease, overfishing, and species introductions. We suggest that anthropogenic disturbance, through its influence on the frequency and/or amplitude of echinoderm population density changes, may go beyond present ecosystem impacts and alter future evolutionary trends.

TI  - Population genetics of the malaria vector <i>Anopheles aconitus</i> in China and Southeast Asia
T2  - INFECTION GENETICS AND EVOLUTION
AB  - Anopheles aconitus is a well-known vector of malaria and is broadly distributed in the Oriental Region, yet there is no information on its population genetic characteristics. In this study, the genetic differentiation among populations was examined using 140 mtDNA COII sequences from 21 sites throughout Southern China, Myanmar, Vietnam, Thailand, Laos and Sri Lanka. The population in Sri Lanka has characteristic rDNA D3 and ITS2, mtDNA COII and ND5 haplotypes, and may be considered a distinct subspecies. Clear genetic structure was observed with highly significant genetic variation present among population groups in Southeast Asia. The greatest genetic diversity exists in Yunnan and Myanmar population groups. All population groups are significantly different from one another in pairwise Fst values, except Northern Thailand with Central Thailand. Mismatch distributions and extremely significant F-s values suggest that the populations passed through a recent demographic expansion. These patterns are discussed in relation to the likely biogeographic history of the region and compared to other Anopheles species. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - A Risk Assessment Framework for Seed Degeneration: Informing an Integrated Seed Health Strategy for Vegetatively Propagated Crops
T2  - PHYTOPATHOLOGY
AB  - Pathogen buildup in vegetative planting material, termed seed degeneration, is a major problem in many low-income countries. When smallholder farmers use seed produced on-farm or acquired outside certified programs, it is often infected. We introduce a risk assessment framework for seed degeneration, evaluating the relative performance of individual and combined components of an integrated seed health strategy. The frequency distribution of management performance outcomes was evaluated for models incorporating biological and environmental heterogeneity, with the following results. (1) On-farm seed selection can perform as well as certified seed, if the rate of success in selecting healthy plants for seed production is high; (2) when choosing among within-season management strategies, external inoculum can determine the relative usefulness of 'incidence-altering management' (affecting the proportion of diseased plants/seeds) and 'rate-altering management' (affecting the rate of disease transmission in the field); (3) under severe disease scenarios, where it is difficult to implement management components at high levels of effectiveness, combining management components can be synergistic and keep seed degeneration below a threshold; (4) combining management components can also close the yield gap between average and worst-case scenarios. We also illustrate the potential for expert elicitation to provide parameter estimates when empirical data are unavailable.

TI  - Floral scent and flower visitors of three green-flowered Costa Rican and Panamanian <i>Blakea</i> species (Melastomataceae) indicate birds rather than rodents as pollinators
T2  - PLANT ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB  - Background and aims - Blakea austin-smithii, B. chlorantha and B. aff. penduliflora from Costa Rican cloud forests share floral traits with rodent-pollinated plants, e.g. cryptic, inconspicuous, green flowers, and are known to be visited and probably pollinated by rodents. However, contrasting records indicate birds as pollen vectors for B. chlorantha. Previously, three Costa Rican Blakea species were described to have flowers lacking scent discernible to humans which is typical for bird-pollinated but not for rodent-pollinated flowers. This study aims at evaluating the role of rodents and birds as pollinators of B. austin-smithii and B. chlorantha in Costa Rica as well as the yet unstudied B. gregii in Panama. Therefore, additional diurnal observation data as well as data on floral traits were collected.
   Methods - In addition to floral visitor observations during the day and measurements of nectar properties, floral colour and morphology, floral scent was analysed by means of coupled gas chromatography - mass spectrometry. Two bee-pollinated Blakea species were chosen as methodological standards.
   Key results - We observed three passerine bird species, Chlorospingus flavopectus, C. pileatus, Myioborus torquatus, and the hummingbird Lampornis calolaemus visiting B. austin-smithii as well as the hummingbird Panterpe insignis visiting the similar Panamanian B. gregii. Whereas no scent was detected in B. austin-smithii, B. chlorantha and B. gregii, strong odours of B. maurofernandeziana (roselike) and B. anomala (lemon-like) could be confirmed with the finding of > 70% phenylethyl alcohol, and monoterpenes, respectively.
   Conclusions - The bird observations together with lacking olfactory signals point to birds as main pollinators. However, to clearly evaluate pollinator importance of the different vertebrates, further observations and proof of pollen transfer are needed.

TI  - Health of an <i>ex situ</i> population of raptors (Falconiformes and Strigiformes) in Mexico: diagnosis of internal parasites
T2  - REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL
AB  - Successful programs for ex situ and in situ conservation and management of raptors require detailed knowledge about their pathogens. The purpose of this study was to identify the internal parasites of some captive raptors in Mexico, as well as to verify their impact in the health status of infected birds. Birds of prey were confiscated and kept in captivity at the Centro de Investigacion y Conservacion de Vida Silvestre (CIVS) in Los Reyes La Paz, Mexico State. For this, fecal and blood samples from 74 birds of prey (66 Falconiformes and eight Strigiformes) of 15 species, juveniles and adults from both sexes (39 males and 35 female), were examined for the presence of gastrointestinal and blood parasites. Besides, the oropharyngeal cavity was macroscopically examined for the presence of lesions compatible with trichomoniasis. Among our results we found that lesions compatible with Trichomonas gallinae infection were detected only in two Red-tailed hawks (Buteo jamaicensis) (2.7%); nevertheless, infected birds were in good physical condition. Overall, gastrointestinal parasites were found in 10 (13.5%) raptors: nine falconiforms (13.6%) and one strigiform (12.5%), which mainly presented a single type of gastrointestinal parasite (90%). Eimeria spp. was detected in Harris's hawk (Parabuteo unicinctus), Swainson's hawk (Buteo swainsoni), Red-tailed hawk (B. jamaicensis) and Great horned owl (Bubo virginianus); whereas trematodes eggs were found in Peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus) and Swainson's hawk (B. swainsoni). Furthermore, eggs of Capillaria spp. were found in one Swainson's hawk (B. swainsoni), which was also infected by trematodes. Hemoprotozoarian were detected in five (6.7%) falconiforms: Haemoproteus spp. in American kestrel (F. sparverius) and Leucocytozoon spp. in Red-tailed hawk (B. jamaicencis). Despite this, no clinical signs referable to gastrointestinal or blood parasite infection were observed in any birds. All parasites identified were recorded for the first time in raptors from Mexico. Furthermore, this represents the first report for T. gallinae, trematodes, Haemoproteus spp. and Leucocytozoon spp. in raptors from Latin America. Diagnosis and control of parasitic infections should be a part of the routine in health care evaluations for ex situ raptor populations. Finally, this information is also valuable for in situ conservation actions on these birds. Rev. Biol. Trop. 59 (3): 1265-1274. Epub 2011 September 01.

TI  - IDENTIFICATION OF QTLS FOR YIELD AND CONTRIBUTING TRAITS IN MAIZE-TEOSINTE DERIVED BILS UNDER DISEASED-STRESSED AND CONTROL CONDITIONS
T2  - GENETIKA-BELGRADE
AB  - In maize, grain yield is the most important trait having a complex inheritance pattern. Yield contributing traits are more stable and have higher heritability than yield. Therefore, the present study was conducted to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with grain yield and its components by using simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. A population of 169 BC1F5 lines was derived from the crossing between maize inbred line DI-103 and teosinte-parviglumis was utilized for genotyping and phenotyping. In diseased stressed condition (E-1), ear length (EL), ear diameter (ED), kernel rows per ear (KR/E), kernels per row (K/R), test weight (TW), and grain yield per plant (GY/P) had 7, 6, 7, 4, 6 and 5 QTLs whereas, in controlled condition (E-2) 5, 2, 5, 4, 5 and 3 QTLs were detected for enlisted characters, respectively. Consistent QTLs across the environments were detected for 5 of the 6 investigated traits and number of QTLs were EL (2), ED (1), KR/E (3), TW (1), and GY/P (1) whereas, for K/R none of the QTLs were common between E-1 and E-2. By mapping analysis, we have identified genomic regions associated with two traits in a manner that was consistent with phenotypic correlations among traits, supporting either pleiotropy or tight linkage among QTLs. Three co-localized QTLs were identified between grain yield and contributing traits. Notably umc1720-linked QTL at bin 4.10 was simultaneously responsible for GY and EL, ED, KR/E, K/R; umc1215-linked QTL at bin 6.03 was simultaneously responsible for GY and ED, KR/E, K/R, TW; umc1279-linked QTL was responsible for GY and ED, TW. The findings suggest that the chromosomal region containing co-localized QTLs governing multiple yields associated traits are potential targets for selection. In addition for 6 studied traits, 44 superior lines were identified, and along with both the parents i.e. maize (DI103) and teosinte they were clustered in 11 groups. Therefore, lines clustered independently can be utilized in a hybridization programme for the accumulation of yield contributing traits for yield maximization.

TI  - Two Novel Parvoviruses in Frugivorous New and Old World Bats
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Bats, a globally distributed group of mammals with high ecological importance, are increasingly recognized as natural reservoir hosts for viral agents of significance to human and animal health. In the present study, we evaluated pools of blood samples obtained from two phylogenetically distant bat families, in particular from flying foxes (Pteropodidae), Eidolon helvum in West Africa, and from two species of New World leaf-nosed fruit bats (Phyllostomidae), Artibeus jamaicensis and Artibeus lituratus in Central America. A sequence-independent virus discovery technique (VIDISCA) was used in combination with high throughput sequencing to detect two novel parvoviruses: a PARV4-like virus named Eh-BtPV-1 in Eidolon helvum from Ghana and the first member of a putative new genus in Artibeus jamaicensis from Panama (Aj-BtPV-1). Those viruses were circulating in the corresponding bat colony at rates of 7-8%. Aj-BtPV-1 was also found in Artibeus lituratus (5.5%). Both viruses were detected in the blood of infected animals at high concentrations: up to 10E8 and to 10E10 copies/ml for Aj-BtPV-1 and Eh-BtPV-1 respectively. Eh-BtPV-1 was additionally detected in all organs collected from bats (brain, lungs, liver, spleen, kidneys and intestine) and spleen and kidneys were identified as the most likely sites where viral replication takes place. Our study shows that bat parvoviruses share common ancestors with known parvoviruses of humans and livestock. We also provide evidence that a variety of Parvovirinae are able to cause active infection in bats and that they are widely distributed in these animals with different geographic origin, ecologies and climatic ranges.

TI  - Back to basics: an evaluation of NaOH and alternative rapid DNA extraction protocols for DNA barcoding, genotyping, and disease diagnostics from fungal and oomycete samples
T2  - MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES
AB  - The ubiquity, high diversity and often-cryptic manifestations of fungi and oomycetes frequently necessitate molecular tools for detecting and identifying them in the environment. In applications including DNA barcoding, pathogen detection from plant samples, and genotyping for population genetics and epidemiology, rapid and dependable DNA extraction methods scalable from one to hundreds of samples are desirable. We evaluated several rapid extraction methods (NaOH, Rapid one-step extraction (ROSE), Chelex 100, proteinase K) for their ability to obtain DNA of quantity and quality suitable for the following applications: PCR amplification of the multicopy barcoding locus ITS1/5.8S/ITS2 from various fungal cultures and sporocarps; single-copy microsatellite amplification from cultures of the phytopathogenic oomycete Phytophthora ramorum; probe-based P. ramorum detection from leaves. Several methods were effective for most of the applications, with NaOH extraction favored in terms of success rate, cost, speed and simplicity. Frozen dilutions of ROSE and NaOH extracts maintained PCR viability for over 32 months. DNA from rapid extractions performed poorly compared to CTAB/phenol-chloroform extracts for TaqMan diagnostics from tanoak leaves, suggesting that incomplete removal of PCR inhibitors is an issue for sensitive diagnostic procedures, especially from plants with recalcitrant leaf chemistry. NaOH extracts exhibited lower yield and size than CTAB/phenol-chloroform extracts; however, NaOH extraction facilitated obtaining clean sequence data from sporocarps contaminated by other fungi, perhaps due to dilution resulting from low DNA yield. We conclude that conventional extractions are often unnecessary for routine DNA sequencing or genotyping of fungi and oomycetes, and recommend simpler strategies where source materials and intended applications warrant such use.

TI  - The durability of long-lasting insecticidal nets distributed to the households between 2009 and 2013 in Nepal
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HEALTH
AB  - Background Understanding and improving the durability of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) in the field are critical for planning future implementation strategies including behavioral change for care and maintenance. LLIN distribution at high coverage is considered to be one of the adjunctive transmission reduction strategies in Nepal's Malaria Strategic Plan 2014-2025. The main objective of this study was to assess the durability through assessment of community usage, physical integrity, residual bio-efficacy, and chemical retention in LLINs: Interceptor (R), Yorkool (R), and PermaNet (R) 2.0 which were used in Nepal during 2009 through 2013. Methods Assessments were conducted on random samples (n = 440) of LLINs from the eleven districts representing four ecological zones: Terai plain region (Kailali and Kanchanpur districts), outer Terai fluvial ecosystem (Surkhet, Dang, and Rupandhei districts), inner Terai forest ecosystem (Mahhothari, Dhanusa, and Illam districts), and Hills and river valley (Kavrepalanchock and Sindhupalchok districts). For each LLIN, fabric integrity in terms of proportionate hole index (pHI) and residual bio-efficacy were assessed. However, for chemical retention, a representative sample of 44 nets (15 Yorkool (R), 10 Permanet (R) 2.0, and 19 Interceptor (R)) was evaluated. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics stratified by LLINs brand, districts, and duration of exposure. Results On average, duration of use of LLINs was shortest for the Yorkool (R) samples, followed by PermaNet (R) 2.0 and Interceptor (R) with median ages of 8.9 (IQR = 0.4), 23.8 (IQR = 3.2), and 50.1 (IQR = 3.2) months, respectively. Over 80% of field distributed Yorkool (R) and PermaNet (R) 2.0 nets were in good condition (pHI< 25) compared to Interceptor (R) (66%). Bio-efficacy analysis showed that average mortality rates of Interceptor and Yorkool were below World Health Organization (WHO) optimal effectiveness of >= 80% compared to 2-year-old PermaNet 2.0 which attained 80%. Chemical retention analysis was consistent with bio-efficacy results. Conclusion This study shows that distribution of LLINs is effective for malaria control; however, serviceable life of LLINs should be considered in terms of waning residual bio-efficacy that warrants replacement. As an adjunctive malaria control tool, National Malaria Control Program of Nepal can benefit by renewing the distribution of LLINs in an appropriate time frame in addition to utilizing durable and effective LLINs.

TI  - Modeling the Relationship between Precipitation and Malaria Incidence in Children from a Holoendemic Area in Ghana
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Climatic factors influence the incidence of vector-borne diseases such as malaria. They modify the abundance of mosquito populations, the length of the extrinsic parasite cycle in the mosquito, the malarial dynamics, and the emergence of epidemics in areas of low endemicity. The objective of this study was to investigate temporal associations between weekly malaria incidence in 1,993 children <15 years of age and weekly rainfall. A time series analysis was conducted by using cross-correlation function and autoregressive modeling. The regression model showed that the level of rainfall predicted the malaria incidence after a time lag of 9 weeks (mean = 60 days) and after a time lag between one and two weeks. The analyses provide evidence that high-resolution precipitation data can directly predict malaria incidence in a highly endemic area. Such models might enable the development of early warning systems and support intervention measures.

TI  - An outbreak of Ebola in Uganda
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE & INTERNATIONAL HEALTH
AB  - An outbreak of Ebola disease was reported from Gulu district, Uganda, on 8 October 2000. The outbreak was characterized by fever and haemorrhagic manifestations, and affected health workers and the general population of Rwot-Obillo, a village 14 km north of Gulu town. Later, the outbreak spread to other parts of the country including Mbarara and Masindi districts. Response measures included surveillance, community mobilization, case and logistics management. Three coordination committees were formed: National Task Force (NTF), a District Task Force (DTF) and an Interministerial Task Force (IMTF). The NTF and DTF were responsible for coordination and follow-up of implementation of activities at the national and district levels, respectively, while the IMTF provided political direction and handled sensitive issues related to stigma, trade, tourism and international relations. The international response was coordinated by the World Health Organization ( WHO) under the umbrella organization of the Global Outbreak and Alert Response Network. A WHO/CDC case definition for Ebola was adapted and used to capture four categories of cases, namely, the 'alert', 'suspected', 'probable' and 'confirmed cases'. Guidelines for identification and management of cases were developed and disseminated to all persons responsible for surveillance, case management, contact tracing and Information Education Communication (IEC). For the duration of the epidemic that lasted up to 16 January 2001, a total of 425 cases with 224 deaths were reported countrywide. The case fatality rate was 53%. The attack rate (AR) was highest in women. The average AR for Gulu district was 12.6 cases/10000 inhabitants when the contacts of all cases were considered and was 4.5 cases/10000 if limited only to contacts of laboratory confirmed cases. The secondary AR was 2.5% when nearly 5000 contacts were followed up for 21 days. Uganda was finally declared Ebola free on 27 February 2001, 42 days after the last case was reported. The Government's role in coordination of both local and international support was vital. The NTF and the corresponding district committees harmonized implementation of a mutually agreed programme. Community mobilization using community-based resource persons and political organs, such as Members of Parliament was effective in getting information to the public. This was critical in controlling the epidemic. Past experience in epidemic management has shown that in the absence of regular provision of information to the public, there are bound to be deleterious rumours. Consequently rumour was managed by frank and open discussion of the epidemic, providing daily updates, fact sheets and press releases. Information was regularly disseminated to communities through mass media and press conferences. Thus all levels of the community spontaneously demonstrated solidarity and response to public health interventions. Even in areas of relative insecurity, rebel abductions diminished considerably.

TI  - Challenges in the use of genetic mark-recapture to estimate the population size of Bwindi mountain gorillas (<i>Gorilla beringei beringei</i>)
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Monitoring the population dynamics of endangered species is a critical component of conservation management strategies, but attaining accurate and precise estimates of population sizes using cost and time effective methods can be challenging. Routine censuses of the two populations of critically endangered mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei have been conducted over the last decades to monitor populations and evaluate the effectiveness of conservation strategies. A census in 2006 of the mountain gorillas in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda, showed the value of genetic analysis of fecal samples collected at nest sites by revealing discrepancies between the numbers of nests and uniquely identified gorillas. In this study, we censused the Bwindi gorilla population using a 'mark-recapture' method which involved genetic analysis of fecal samples collected in 2011 during two 'sweep' surveys of the entire park. We found that a notable proportion of gorillas were missed in either of the two sweeps (minimum 35% and 31%, respectively). Based on the number of genotyped gorillas and correction factors, we estimated the population to contain a minimum of 400 individuals. Using the mark-recapture approach, we infer possibly as many as 430 gorillas (95% confidence interval: 398-487). As the 2010 census of the Virunga Massif population found 480 gorillas, the total number of mountain gorillas worldwide is at least 880 individuals. Simulations using different mark-recapture models suggest that a future census of Bwindi mountain gorillas would benefit by increasing the number of sweeps in order to achieve accurate and precise results. Finally, based on our results, we recommend a sequential approach incorporating a pilot study and simulations for optimizing time and resources in large mammal genetic census studies.

TI  - Growth performance of <i>sengon</i> (<i>Falcataria mollucana</i>) and <i>manglid</i> (<i>Magnolia champaca</i>) at different spacing distance
T2  - INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON FOREST CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT (ICFCM) 2019: INNOVATIVE SOLUTION FOR MANAGING TROPICAL FORESTS AND CONSERVING BIODIVERSITY TO SUPPORT SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS
CP  - International Conference on Forest Conservation and Management (ICFCM)
AB  - Sengon (Falcataria mollucana) has rapid growth, but susceptible to pest and disease, while manglid (Magnolia champaca) has slower growth compared to sengon, but relatively more resistant. Farmers can prevent high losses by interplanting their land with sengon and manglid. This interplanting technique between sengon and manglid has not been widely known. The study was conducted in Sodonghilir Village, Tasikmalaya, West Java, from December 2015 - November 2018. Seedlings were planted with minimal height of 30 cm and planted at the beginning of the rainy season, and each seedling was tied to a bamboo stick. One month after planting, plants were given an organic fertilizer TSP (phosphorus) and urea with a ratio of 1:2, 50 gr each plant. The study used split plots design with tree species (sengon and manglid) as the main factor and spacing as sub-plots (3 x 3 m, 3 x 4 m, 3 x 5 m, and 3 x 6 m). The treatments resulted in 8 combinations with 49 plants as the observation unit with four replications. The total planted area was 1 ha. The results showed that the interaction between species and spacing had a significant effect on the growth of sengon and manglid. The results showed the highest height was shown by treatment S4 (sengon, 3 x 6 m) with a height of 297.48 cm, while the highest diameter by S3 (sengon, 3 x 5 m) with a diameter of 52.9 mm. Sengon is more productive than manglid. However, the local community prefers to plant both species (manglid and sengon) to overcome the loss of income because sengon is more prone to pest and disease compared to manglid.

TI  - Beta diversity, prevalence, and specificity of avian haemosporidian parasites throughout the annual cycle of Chilean Elaenia (<i>Elaenia chilensis</i>), a Neotropical austral migrant
T2  - PARASITOLOGY
AB  - Migratory birds are implicated in dispersing haemosporidian parasites over great geographic distances. However, their role in sharing these vector-transmitted blood parasites with resident avian host species along their migration flyway is not well understood. We studied avian haemosporidian parasites in 10 localities where Chilean Elaenia, a long-distance Neotropical austral migrant species, spends part of its annual cycle to determine local parasite transmission among resident sympatric host species in the elaenia's distributional range across South America. We sampled 371 Chilean Elaenias and 1,818 birds representing 243 additional sympatric species from Brazilian wintering grounds to Argentinian breeding grounds. The 23 haemosporidian lineages found in Chilean Elaenias exhibited considerable variation in distribution, specialization, and turnover across the 10 avian communities in South America. Parasite lineage dissimilarity increased with geographic distance, and infection probability by Parahaemoproteus decreased in localities harbouring a more diverse haemosporidian fauna. Furthermore, blood smears from migrating Chilean Elaenias and local resident avian host species did not contain infective stages of Leucocytozoon, suggesting that transmission did not take place in the Brazilian stopover site. Our analyses confirm that this Neotropical austral migrant connects avian host communities and transports haemosporidian parasites along its distributional range in South America. However, the lack of transmissive stages at stopover site and the infrequent parasite lineage sharing between migratory host populations and residents at breeding and wintering grounds suggest that Chilean Elaenias do not play a significant role in dispersing haemosporidian parasites, nor do they influence local transmission across South America.

TI  - Environment and host species shape the skin microbiome of captive neotropical bats
T2  - PEERJ
AB  - Background. A wide range of microorganisms inhabit animal skin. This microbial community (microbiome) plays an important role in host defense against pathogens and disease. Bats (Chiroptera: Mammalia) are an ecologically and evolutionarily diversified group with a relatively unexplored skin microbiome. The bat skin microbiome could play a role in disease resistance, for example, to white nose syndrome (WNS), an infection which has been devastating North American bat populations. However, fundamental knowledge of the bat skin microbiome is needed before understanding its role in health and disease resistance. Captive neotropical frugivorous bats Artibeus jamaicensis and Carolliaperspicillata provide a simple controlled system in which to characterize the factors shaping the bat microbiome. Here, we aimed to determine the relative importance of habitat and host species on the bat skin microbiome.
   Methods. We performed high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing of the skin microbiome of two different bat species living in captivity in two different habitats. In the first habitat, A. jamaicensis and C. perspicillata lived together, while the second habitat contained only A. jamaicensis.
   Results. We found that both habitat and host species shape the composition and diversity of the skin microbiome, with habitat having the strongest influence. Cohabitating A. jamaicensis and C. perspicillata shared more similar skin microbiomes than members of the same species (A. jamaicensis) across two habitats.
   Discussion. These results suggest that in captivity, the skin microbial community is homogenised by the shared environments and individual proximities of bats living together in the same habitat, at the expense of the innate host species factors. The predominant influence of habitat suggests that environmental microorganisms or pathogens might colonize bat skin. We also propose that bat populations could differ in pathogen susceptibility depending on their immediate environment and habitat.

TI  - First record of translocation in Culicidae (Diptera) mitogenomes: evidence from the tribe Sabethini
T2  - BMC GENOMICS
AB  - Background The tribe Sabethini (Diptera: Culicidae) contains important vectors of the yellow fever virus and presents remarkable morphological and ecological diversity unequalled in other mosquito groups. However, there is limited information about mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes) from these species. As mitochondrial genetics has been fundamental for posing evolutionary hypotheses and identifying taxonomical markers, in this study we sequenced the first sabethine mitogenomes: Sabethes undosus, Trichoprosopon pallidiventer, Runchomyia reversa, Limatus flavisetosus, and Wyeomyia confusa. In addition, we performed phylogenetic analyses of Sabethini within Culicidae and compared its mitogenomic architecture to that of other insects. Results Similar to other insects, the Sabethini mitogenome contains 13 protein-coding genes, 22 transfer RNA genes, two ribosomal RNA genes, and a control region. However, the gene order is not the same as that in other mosquitoes; the tyrosine (Y) and cysteine (C) tRNA genes have translocated. In general, mitogenome rearrangements within insects are uncommon events; the translocation reported here is unparalleled among Culicidae and can be considered an autapomorphy for the Neotropical sabethines. Conclusions Our study provides clear evidence of gene rearrangements in the mitogenomes of these Neotropical genera in the tribe Sabethini. Gene order can be informative at the taxonomic level of tribe. The translocations found, along with the mitogenomic sequence data and other recently published findings, reinforce the status of Sabethini as a well-supported monophyletic taxon. Furthermore, T. pallidiventer was recovered as sister to R. reversa, and both were placed as sisters of other Sabethini genera (Sabethes, Wyeomyia, and Limatus).

TI  - Spatiotemporal exposome dynamics of soil lead and children's blood lead pre-and ten years post-Hurricane Katrina: Lead and other metals on public and private properties in the city of New Orleans, Louisiana, USA
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Anthropogenic re-distribution of lead (Pb) principally through its use in gasoline additives and lead-based paints have transformed the urban exposome. This unique study tracks urban-scale soil Pb (SPb) and blood Pb (BPb) responses of children living in public and private communities in New Orleans before and ten years after Hurricane Katrina (29 August 2005).
   Objectives: To compare and evaluate associations of pre- and ten years post-Katrina SPb and children's BPb on public and private residential census tracts in the core and outer areas of New Orleans, and to examine correlations between SPb and nine other soil metals.
   Methods: The Louisiana Healthy Housing and Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program BPb (mu g/dL) data from pre- (2000-2005) and post-Katrina (2010-2015) for <= 6-year-old children. Data from public and adjacent private residential census tracts within core and outer areas are stratified from a database that includes 916 and 922 SPb and 13,379 and 4830 BPb results, respectively, from pre- and post-Katrina New Orleans. Statistical analyses utilize Multi-Response Permutation Procedure and Spearman's Rho Correlation.
   Results: Pre- to Post-Katrina median SPb decreases in public and private core census tracts were from 285 to 55 mg/kg and 710-291 mg/kg, respectively. In public and private outer census tracts the median SPb decreased from 109 to 56 mg/kg and 88-55 mg/kg. Children's BPb percent >= 5 mu g/dL on public and private core areas pre Katrina was 63.2% and 67.5%, and declined post-Katrina to 7.6% and 20.2%, respectively. BPb decreases also occurred in outer areas. Soil Pb is strongly correlated with other metals.
   Conclusions: Post-Katrina re-building of public housing plus landscaping amends the exposome and reduces children's BPb. Most importantly, Hurricane Katrina revealed that decreasing the toxicants in the soil exposome is an effective intervention for decreasing children's BPb.

TI  - Proteomic Analysis of Skin Invasion by Blood Fluke Larvae
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background: During invasion of human skin by schistosome blood fluke larvae (cercariae), a multicellular organism breaches the epidermis, basement membrane, and dermal barriers of skin. To better understand the pathobiology of this initial event in schistosome infection, a proteome analysis of human skin was carried out following invasion by cercariae of Schistosoma mansoni.
   Methodology and Results: Human skin samples were exposed to cercariae for one-half hour to two hours. Controls were exposed to water used to collect cercariae in an identical manner, and punctured to simulate cercarial tunnels. Fluid from both control and experimental samples was analyzed by LC/MS/MS using a linear ion trap in "triple play" mode. The coexistence of proteins released by cercariae and host skin proteins from epidermis and basement membrane confirmed that cercarial tunnels in skin were sampled. Among the abundant proteins secreted by cercariae was the cercarial protease that has been implicated in degradation of host proteins, secreted proteins proposed to mediate immune invasion by larvae, and proteins implicated in protection of parasites against oxidative stress. Components of the schistosome surface tegument, previously identified with immune serum, were also released. Both lysis and apoptosis of epidermal cells took place during cercarial invasion of the epidermis. Components of lysed epidermal cells, including desmosome proteins which link cells in the stratum granulosum and stratum spinosum, were identified. While macrophage-derived proteins were present, no mast cell or lymphocyte cytokines were identified. There were, however, abundant immunoglobulins, complement factors, and serine protease inhibitors in skin. Control skin samples incubated with water for the same period as experimental samples ensured that invasion-related proteins and host protein fragments were not due to nonspecific degeneration of the skin samples.
   Conclusions: This analysis identified secreted proteins from invasive larvae that are released during invasion of human skin. Analysis of specific host proteins in skin invaded by cercariae served to highlight both the histolytic events facilitating cercarial invasion, and the host defenses that attempt to arrest or retard invasion. Proteins abundant in psoriatic skin or UV and heat-stressed skin were not abundant in skin invaded by cercariae, suggesting that results did not reflect general stress in the surgically removed skin specimen. Abundant immunoglobulins, complement factors, and serine protease inhibitors in skin form a biochemical barrier that complements the structural barrier of the epidermis, basement membrane, and dermis. The fragmentation of some of these host proteins suggests that breaching of host defenses by cercariae includes specific degradation of immunoglobulins and complement, and either degradation of, or overwhelming the host protease inhibitor repertoire.

TI  - Responses of rubber leaf phenology to climatic variations in Southwest China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMETEOROLOGY
CP  - 33rd International Geographical Congress (IGC) of the International-Geographic-Union (IGU)
AB  - The phenology of rubber trees (Hevea brasiliensis) could be influenced by meteorological factors and exhibits significant changes under different geoclimates. In the sub-optimal environment in Xishuangbanna, rubber trees undergo lengthy periods of defoliation and refoliation. The timing of refoliation from budburst to leaf aging could be affected by powdery mildew disease (Oidium heveae), which negatively impacts seed and latex production. Rubber trees are most susceptible to powdery mildew disease at the copper and leaf changing stages. Understanding and predicting leaf phenology of rubber trees are helpful to develop effective means of controlling the disease. This research investigated the effect of several meteorological factors on different leaf phenological stages in a sub-optimal environment for rubber cultivation in Jinghong, Yunnan in Southwest China. Partial least square regression was used to quantify the relationship between meteorological factors and recorded rubber phenologies from 2003 to 2011. Minimum temperature in December was found to be the critical factor for the leaf phenology development of rubber trees. Comparing the delayed effects of minimum temperature, the maximum temperature, diurnal temperature range, and sunshine hours were found to advancing leaf phenologies. A comparatively lower minimum temperature in December would facilitate the advancing of leaf phenologies of rubber trees. Higher levels of precipitation in February delayed the light green and the entire process of leaf aging. Delayed leaf phenology was found to be related to severe rubber powdery mildew disease. These results were used to build predictive models that could be applied to early warning systems of rubber powdery mildew disease.

TI  - Purification and enzymatic characterization of a novel metalloprotease from <i>Lachesis muta rhombeata</i> snake venom
T2  - JOURNAL OF VENOMOUS ANIMALS AND TOXINS INCLUDING TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - BackgroundLachesis muta rhombeata (Lmr) is the largest venomous snake in Latin America and its venom contains mainly enzymatic components, such as serine and metalloproteases, L-amino acid oxidase and phospholipases A(2). Metalloproteases comprise a large group of zinc-dependent proteases that cleave basement membrane components such as fibronectin, laminin and collagen type IV. These enzymes are responsible for local and systemic changes, including haemorrhage, myonecrosis and inflammation. This study aimed the isolation and enzymatic characterization of the first metalloprotease (Lmr-MP) from Lmr venom (LmrV).Methods and resultsLmr-MP was purified through two chromatographic steps and submitted to enzymatic characterization. It showed proteolytic activity on azocasein with maximum activity at pH7.0-9.0. It was inhibited by EDTA (a metal chelator that removes zinc, which is essential for enzymatic activity) and no effect was observed with PMSF, iodoacetic acid or pepstatin (inhibitors of serine, cysteine and aspartyl proteases, respectively). Ca2+, Mg2+ and Ba2+ ions increased its activity, while Al3+, Cu2+, Ni2+ and Zn2+ inhibited it. Additionally, ZnCl2 showed a dose dependent inhibition of the enzyme. Lmr-MP activity was also evaluated upon chromogenic substrates for plasma kallikrein (S-2302), plasmin and streptokinase-activated plasminogen (S-2251) and Factor Xa (S-2222) showing the highest activity on S-2302. The activity in different solutions (5mM or 50mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH7.8; 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid +50% acetonitrile; phosphate buffer saline, pH7.4; 50mM sodium acetate, pH4.0 or ammonium acetate pH4.5) was also evaluated and the results showed that its activity was abolished at acidic pHs. Its molecular mass (22,858Da) was determined by MALDI-TOF and about 90% of its primary structure was verified by high-resolution mass spectrometry using HCD and ETD fragmentations and database search against the sequence of closely related species. It is a novel enzyme which shared high identity with other snake venom metalloproteases (svMPs) belonging to the P-I group.ConclusionThe purification procedure achieved a novel pure highly active metalloprotease from LmrV. This new molecule can help to understand the metalloproteases mechanisms of action, the Lachesis envenoming, as well as to open new perspectives for its use as therapeutic tools.

TI  - Avian community composition affects ornithophilic mosquito and avian malaria turnover across an interfluvial system in southern Amazonia
T2  - JOURNAL OF AVIAN BIOLOGY
AB  - Determining the roles of host ecology and geography on the distribution of parasites is an important aim in disease ecology. However, this is extremely challenging for vector transmitted pathogens due to complex host-vector-parasite interactions. Here, we assess community turnover of birds, ornithophilic mosquitoes and Plasmodium parasites at different dimensions of diversity (taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic). We test if rivers can act as a geographic barrier to bird, mosquito and Plasmodium communities, and analyze the relationship among community turnover of these biological groups. We compiled two published datasets on bird, mosquito and Plasmodium communities collected in seven localities across the Tapajos river in southern Amazonia. We calculated the community turnover of bird, mosquito and Plasmodium communities, and identified the effect of river margin on community composition by comparing observed values with null models. Mantel tests were used to examine the different turnover dimensions within this host-vector-parasite system. Bird communities on the same riverbank were more similar, whereas bird phylogenetic turnover between riverbanks was more dissimilar than expected by chance. Neither mosquito nor Plasmodium turnover showed significant turnover between riverbank margins. We found a positive correlation between bird community turnover, both taxonomic and functional, and mosquito community turnover. Bird community taxonomic turnover was also positively related to Plasmodium community phylogenetic turnover. Our results suggest that geographic barriers created by the Tapajos river affect bird community assembly but do not constrain mosquito and Plasmodium distributions. Additionally, bird communities may play a key-role in the community dynamics of mosquito vectors and Plasmodium parasites.

TI  - Root infection and aerial colonization of eucalypt host plants by Erwinia psidii
T2  - TROPICAL PLANT PATHOLOGY
AB  - Dieback, caused by Erwinia psidii is currently one of the most severe emerging diseases of Eucalyptus spp. in Brazil. Because of its recent report, little is known about the mechanisms underlying bacterial infection. We studied the colonization and movement of E. psidii in host tissue using a strain labeled with green fluorescent protein. We were able to transform E. psidii with pGreen-TIR and to demonstrate plasmid stability in the absence of antibiotic selection both in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrate that tissue colonization by E. psidii is not restricted to the inoculation point (leaf axil). E. psidii colonizes the xylem vessels, sclerenchyma and parenchyma of leaves and stems of eucalypt. At 35days after inoculation, the bacterium was found at 5cm above the inoculation point, indicating that it colonizes the plant acropetally. Confocal microscopy analysis revealed that when root-inoculated the bacterium penetrates the primary and secondary roots and reaches the xylem, but it was never found in the root crown or stem, irrespective of the evaluation time. Our results provide insights into the biology of the E. psidii-eucalypt interaction, which requires a better understanding in order to design efficient strategies for pathogen control and disease management.

TI  - Diversity and Synanthropy of Calliphoridae (Diptera) in the Region of Rio Claro, SP, Brazil
T2  - NEOTROPICAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - Dipteran blowflies (Calliphoridae) are of great medical and hygienic importance as vectors of pathogens and as parasites of living and dead tissue, and their association with carrion allows their use in forensic entomology. The objective of this study was to determine the synanthropic index of adult Calliphoridae (Diptera) collected in Rio Claro, So Paulo. Sampling occurred between September 2009 and August 2010. Traps baited with sardines, beef liver, and minced meat were assessed for five consecutive days per month in three distinct ecological areas representing urban, rural, and forest environments. The most abundant species was Lucilia eximia (Wiedemann), followed by Chrysomya albiceps (Wiedemann) and Chrysomya megacephala (Fabricius). Lucilia eximia was the only species present in all seasons and the only species collected during the winter. The season with the lowest abundance was winter, with 69 (5.5%) specimens, and spring was the season with the greatest number of specimens collected (774-61.8%). The only species found outside inhabited areas (synanthropic) was Lucilia cuprina (Wiedemann), with a synanthropy index (SI) value of +5.7. The SI values for the other species were negative, showing a preference for uninhabited areas. The rural and urban areas were most similar in terms of species composition as were the beef and sardine baits. Among the baits used, liver attracted the greatest abundance of calliphorids, whereas minced meat attracted the greatest diversity.

TI  - Colors of night: climate-morphology relationships of geometrid moths along spatial gradients in southwestern China
T2  - OECOLOGIA
AB  - Color lightness of insects is an important ecological trait affecting their performance through multiple functions such as thermoregulation, UV protection and disease resistance. The geographical pattern of color lightness in diurnal insects are relatively well understood and largely driven by thermal melanism through the enhancement of insect activity. In nocturnal insects, however, the ecological function of color lightness in response to climatic factors is poorly understood, particularly at small spatial scales. In this study, we investigated color lightness of nocturnal moth assemblages along environmental gradients. Using geometrid moths collected with comparable methodologies (light trapping), we examined assemblage-level changes in color lightness across elevational gradients and vertical strata (canopy vs understory) across three climatically different locations in Yunnan, China. The results showed that moths are darker in color at higher elevations. Such patterns are most apparent in canopy assemblages. In addition, the strength of the elevational pattern on color lightness varied across location, being most pronounced in the canopy of the subalpine site. These patterns are likely driven by UV protection and/or thermoregulation. Our study highlights the importance of abiotic factors such as temperature and solar radiation in structuring morphological patterns of nocturnal ectothermic assemblages along elevational gradients of climatically harsh environments.

TI  - The Tree Decline Recovery Seesaw; a conceptual model of the decline and recovery of drought stressed plantation trees
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Worldwide tree plantations face prolonged drought periods that are predicted to increase in duration and intensity under climate change scenarios. Trees stressed by drought are susceptible to secondary stressors including pests and pathogens. Depending on the timing and intensity of these stressors, their impact may be persistent or acute, with varied temporal and spatial responses by different hosts. There are complex processes involved in tree performance and mortality, and often it can be difficult to identify the leading cause of growth decline and death. However, it is important to recognise that often death can be a gradual process with periods of recovery. While previous models have focussed on the decline of the tree in response to stress, there has been little focus on the recovery from stress. Hence, the development here of the Tree Decline Recovery Seesaw model. This conceptual model is based on the premise that drought stressed trees may alternate between different stages of health through time, particularly those facing intermittent drought over extended periods. This approach takes into account that recovery periods allow for the tree to regain health, and potentially create new opportunities for pest and disease outbreaks. The Tree Decline Recovery Seesaw model provides researchers with the understanding of the complexity of drought/pest/pathogen interactions, allowing them to assess the order and severity of the stressors to determine the likely outcome. This paper provides a vital step towards the development of predictive tools for plantation managers. While our model has focussed on eucalypt plantation trees, there is potential to apply the model to other tree species and forms of plant stress. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Root-knot and root-lesion nematode suppression by cover crops, poultry litter, and poultry litter compost
T2  - PLANT DISEASE
AB  - Experiments using soil-incorporated cover crops and amendments of poultry litter (PL) and PL compost to suppress root-knot (RKN) and root-lesion nematodes were conducted in response to increasing nematode populations in Maryland's potato production areas. Identical experiments were established in microplots infested with Meloidogyne incognita or Pratylenchus penetrans. Treatments consisted of 123-year rotational sequences comprising potato (year 1) and cucumber (year 2) followed by a moderately RKN-resistant or susceptible soybean cultivar, castor bean, grain sorghum, or sorghum sudangrass; PL or PL compost were amended to some of the RKN-susceptible soybean and sorghum sudangrass plots. In the third year of the rotation, potato followed by soybean was planted in all 12 treatments. The RKN-resistant soybean, castor bean, sorghum sudangrass, and fallow or tillage decreased the populations of M. incognita compared with microplots where RKN-susceptible soybean had been grown. However, RKN populations quickly recovered. Root-lesion nematode was reduced in the spring of 2001 following application of high rates of PL and PL compost in 2000. In the fall of 2001, sorghum sudangrass alone or in combination with PL or PL compost, grain sorghum, or fallow or tillage reduced root-lesion nematodes compared with either soybean cultivar. No treatment affected root-lesion nematode the following year. The use of cover crops and PL compost is an effective method to reduce nematode populations only if successively incorporated into rotational cropping sequences.

TI  - The effects of plant pathogens on tree recruitment in the Western Amazon under a projected future climate: a dynamical systems analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
AB  - 1. Climate change predictions in the Amazon have largely focused on carbon-water relations, while the impacts of increased air temperature and reduced precipitation on host-pathogen relationships have not been extensively explored. These relationships are known to affect recruitment of many Amazonian plant species.
   2. Host-pathogen relationships are well suited to a dynamical analysis of the effects of climate change due to the direct linkages between pathogen behaviour and abiotic factors such as temperature and rainfall.
   3. Seedlings of the palm Iriartea deltoidea experience significant mortality due to infection by the fungus Diplodia mutila. This host-pathogen interaction was examined by combining a semi-analytical model with field data illustrating the temperature sensitivity of D. mutila reproductive rates and I. deltoidea seedling mortality in response to infection.
   4. The data-model combination shows that projected climatic shifts in rainfall and temperature for the Amazon region will tend to reduce recruitment by altering pathogen activity and reducing palm fecundity. The magnitude of the reduction is sensitive to the details of the epidemiology of the D. mutila-I. deltoidea host-pathogen system, and ranges from 10% to 56% under plausible scenarios.
   5. Although considerable uncertainty remains, the proposed model provides a blueprint for research on one aspect of ecosystem change in future climate models.
   6. Synthesis. The study illustrates the potential for ecosystem responses to climate change, which can be investigated through tractable models simple enough to assimilate into climate modelling frameworks. Particular environmental sensitivities in fungal dynamics are identified. The implications of combined plant physiological stress and enhanced pathogenic activity under future climate scenarios are highlighted as critical issues for projecting forest response.

TI  - Assessing the Threat of Amphibian Chytrid Fungus in the Albertine Rift: Past, Present and Future
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), the cause of chytridiomycosis, is a pathogenic fungus that is found worldwide and is a major contributor to amphibian declines and extinctions. We report results of a comprehensive effort to assess the distribution and threat of Bd in one of the Earth's most important biodiversity hotspots, the Albertine Rift in central Africa. In herpetological surveys conducted between 2010 and 2014, 1018 skin swabs from 17 amphibian genera in 39 sites across the Albertine Rift were tested for Bd by PCR. Overall, 19.5% of amphibians tested positive from all sites combined. Skin tissue samples from 163 amphibians were examined histologically; of these two had superficial epidermal intracorneal fungal colonization and lesions consistent with the disease chytridiomycosis. One amphibian was found dead during the surveys, and all others encountered appeared healthy. We found no evidence for Bd-induced mortality events, a finding consistent with other studies. To gain a historical perspective about Bd in the Albertine Rift, skin swabs from 232 museum-archived amphibians collected as voucher specimens from 1925-1994 were tested for Bd. Of these, one sample was positive; an Itombwe River frog (Phrynobatrachus asper) collected in 1950 in the Itombwe highlands. This finding represents the earliest record of Bd in the Democratic Republic of Congo. We modeled the distribution of Bd in the Albertine Rift using MaxEnt software, and trained our model for improved predictability. Our model predicts that Bd is currently widespread across the Albertine Rift, with moderate habitat suitability extending into the lowlands. Under climatic modeling scenarios our model predicts that optimal habitat suitability of Bd will decrease causing a major range contraction of the fungus by 2080. Our baseline data and modeling predictions are important for comparative studies, especially if significant changes in amphibian health status or climactic conditions are encountered in the future.

TI  - Composition and diversity of mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) in urban parks in the South region of the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil
T2  - BIOTA NEOTROPICA
AB  - Many parks in the city of Sao Paulo contain remnants of Atlantic Forest. Of the 30 municipal parks in the South of the city, we investigated two in this study (Santo Dias Park and Shangrila Park) in order to survey their mosquito fauna and investigate the presence of potential bioindicators of environmental conditions and vectors of human pathogens. Mosquitoes were collected monthly between March 2011 and February 2012 using aspirators, Shannon and CDC traps for adult mosquitoes and larval dippers and suction samplers for immature forms. Sampling effort was evaluated by plotting a species accumulation curve, and total richness was estimated using the first-order jackknife. To compare the diversity between the two parks Shannon and Simpson diversity indexes were calculated. Species similarity was compared by the Sorensen similarity index. In all, 8,850 specimens were sampled in both parks. Collections in Santo Dias Park yielded 1,577 adult mosquitoes and 658 immature individuals distributed in seven genera (Aedes, Anopheles, Culex, Limatus, Mansonia, Toxorhynchites and Wyeomyia) and 27 taxonomic units. Among the adult mosquitoes collected, Culex nigripalpus. and Aedes fluviatilis were the most abundant, while the most abundant immature forms were Cx. imitator, Wy. davisi, Wy. galvaoi and Ae. albopictus. Collections in Shangrila Park yielded 4,952 adult specimens and 1,663 immature forms distributed in eight genera (Aedes, Anopheles, Culex, Limatus, Mansonia, Toxorhynchites, Uranotaenia and Wyeomyia) and 36 taxonomic units. Species accumulation curves in both parks were close to the asymptote, and the total richness estimate was close to the observed richness. Although the observed species richness was higher in the Shangrila Park, there was no statistically significant difference between the diversity indexes measured. Regarding species composition, the two sites shared 16 species, including those of epidemiological importance such as Culex nigripalpus, Cx. quinquefasciatus, Aedes albopictus and Ae. aegypti. As some of the mosquito taxa found are bioindicators of environmental conditions and have epidemiological potential to carry pathogens, we recommend that urban parks should be included in official mosquito surveillance programs, and regular surveys carried out to detect circulating arboviruses.

TI  - Evolutionary ecology of plant diseases in natural ecosystems
T2  - ANNUAL REVIEW OF PHYTOPATHOLOGY
AB  - Plant pathogens cause mortality and reduce fecundity of individual plants, drive host population dynamics, and affect the structure and composition of natural plant communities. Pathogens are responsible for both numerical changes in host populations and evolutionary changes through selection for resistant genotypes. Linking such ecological and evolutionary dynamics has been the focus of a growing body of literature on the effects of plant diseases in natural ecosystems. A guiding principle is the importance of understanding the spatial and temporal scales at which plants and pathogens interact. This review summarizes the effects of diseases on populations of wild plants, focusing in particular on the mediation of plant competition and succession, the maintenance of plant species diversity, as well as the process of rapid evolutionary changes in host-pathogen symbioses.

TI  - Patterns of Migration and Risks Associated with Leprosy among Migrants in Maranhao, Brazil
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Leprosy remains a public health problem in Brazil with new case incidence exceeding World Health Organization (WHO) goals in endemic clusters throughout the country. Migration can facilitate movement of disease between endemic and non-endemic areas, and has been considered a possible factor in continued leprosy incidence in Brazil. A study was conducted to investigate migration as a risk factor for leprosy. The study had three aims: (1) examine past five year migration as a risk factor for leprosy, (2) describe and compare geographic and temporal patterns of migration among past 5-year migrants with leprosy and a control group, and (3) examine social determinants of health associated with leprosy among past 5-year migrants. The study implemented a matched case-control design and analysis comparing individuals newly diagnosed with leprosy (n = 340) and a clinically unapparent control group (n = 340) without clinical signs of leprosy, matched for age, sex and location in four endemic municipalities in the state of Maranhao, northeastern Brazil. Fishers exact test was used to conduct bivariate analyses. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was employed to control for possible confounding variables. Eighty cases (23.5%) migrated 5-years prior to diagnosis, and 55 controls (16.2%) migrated 5-years prior to the corresponding case diagnosis. Past 5 year migration was found to be associated with leprosy (OR: 1.59; 95% CI 1.07-2.38; p = 0.02), and remained significantly associated with leprosy after controlling for leprosy contact in the family, household, and family/household contact. Poverty, as well as leprosy contact in the family, household and other leprosy contact, was associated with leprosy among past 5-year migrants in the bivariate analysis. Alcohol consumption was also associated with leprosy, a relevant risk factor in susceptibility to infection that should be explored in future research. Our findings provide insight into patterns of migration to localize focused control efforts in endemic areas with high population mobility.

TI  - Low genotypic diversity and long-term ecological decline in a spatially structured seagrass population
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - In isolated or declining populations, viability may be compromised further by loss of genetic diversity. Therefore, it is important to understand the relationship between long-term ecological trajectories and population genetic structure. However, opportunities to combine these types of data are rare, especially in natural systems. Using an existing panel of 15 microsatellites, we estimated allelic diversity in seagrass, Zostera marina, at five sites around the Isles of Scilly Special Area of Conservation, UK, in 2010 and compared this to 23 years of annual ecological monitoring (1996-2018). We found low diversity and long-term declines in abundance in this relatively pristine but isolated location. Inclusion of the snapshot of genotypic, but less-so genetic, diversity improved prediction of abundance trajectories; however, this was spatial scale-dependent. Selection of the appropriate level of genetic organization and spatial scale for monitoring is, therefore, important to identify drivers of eco-evolutionary dynamics. This has implications for the use of population genetic information in conservation, management, and spatial planning.

TI  - The pathogenic potential of endophytic Botryosphaeriaceous fungi on <i>Terminalia</i> species in Cameroon
T2  - FOREST PATHOLOGY
AB  - In Cameroon, native Terminalia spp. represent an important component of the forestry industry, but limited information is available regarding the fungal pathogens that affect them. The Botryosphaeriaceae are endophytic fungi and latent pathogens that can result in wood stain, cankers, die-back and death of trees, particularly when trees are under stress. The aim of this study was, therefore, to identify and characterize the Botryosphaeriaceae occurring as endophytes of Terminalia spp. in Cameroon, as part of a larger project to identify potential pathogens of these trees in the country. Samples were collected from three Terminalia spp. in the Central, Southern and Eastern Regions and the resultant Botryosphaeriaceae were identified using morphology and DNA sequence comparisons for the ITS and tef 1-alpha gene regions. Furthermore, inoculation trials were conducted to consider the relative pathogenicity of the isolates collected. The majority of isolates (88%) represented species of Lasiodiplodia, including L. pseudotheobromae, L. theobromae and L. parva. The remaining isolates were identified as Endomelanconiopsis endophytica. Pathogenicity trials on young T. mantaly and T. catappa trees revealed that L. pseudotheobromae was the most pathogenic species followed by L. theobromae.

TI  - Using distribution models to estimate blooms of phytosanitary cyanobacteria in Brazil
T2  - BIOTA NEOTROPICA
AB  - The multiple uses of aquatic ecosystems by humankind and the continuous interference of their activities have contributed to the emergence of potentially toxic cyanobacteria blooms. Here, we firstly created a database of occurrences of cyanobacteria blooms in Brazil through a systematic review of the scientific literature available in online platforms (e.g. Web of Science, Capes Thesis Catalogue). Secondly, we carried out ecological niche models with occurrence data obtained from these studies to predict climatically suitable areas for blooms. We select 21 bioclimatic variables input environmental data. We used five modeling methods for the current climate scenario: (1) Maxent; (2) Support Vector Machines; (3) Random Forest; (4) Maximum Likelihood e (5) Gaussian. We found that the number of publications about bloom events was higher in 2009 with a decline in the years 2012, 2013 and 2017. Furthermore, the years with the higher records of blooms in freshwater environments were 2005, 2011 e 2014. These events occurring mainly in public supply reservoirs and are mostly of the genera Microcystis Lemmermann, 1907, Dolichospetmum (Ralfs ex Bornet & Flahault) P.Wacklin, L.Hoffmann & J.Komarek, 2009 and Raphidiopsis F.E.Fritsch & F.Rich, 1929. Modeling the potential distribution of blooms, we found sampling gaps that should be targeting for future researches, especially in the Amazon biome. Overall, the models did not predict highly suitable areas in the /north of Brazil, while other regions were relatively well distributed with a higher number of occurrence records in the Southeast region.

TI  - Subproteome of <i>Lachesis muta rhombeata</i> venom and preliminary studies on LmrSP-4, a novel snake venom serine proteinase
T2  - JOURNAL OF VENOMOUS ANIMALS AND TOXINS INCLUDING TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background: Lachesis muta rhombeata is one of the venomous snakes of medical importance in Brazil whose envenoming is characterized by local and systemic effects which may produce even shock and death. Its venom is mainly comprised of serine and metalloproteinases, phospholipases A(2) and bradykinin-potentiating peptides. Based on a previously reported fractionation of L. m. rhombeata venom (LmrV), we decided to perform a subproteome analysis of its major fraction and investigated a novel component present in this venom.
   Methods: LmrV was fractionated through molecular exclusion chromatography and the main fraction (S5) was submitted to fibrinogenolytic activity assay and fractionated by reversed-phase chromatography. The N-terminal sequences of the subfractions eluted from reversed-phase chromatography were determined by automated Edman degradation. Enzyme activity of LmrSP-4 was evaluated upon chromogenic substrates for thrombin (S-2238), plasma kallikrein (S-2302), plasmin and streptokinase-activated plasminogen (S-2251) and Factor Xa (S-2222) and upon fibrinogen. All assays were carried out in the presence or absence of possible inhibitors. The fluorescence resonance energy transfer substrate Abz-KLRSSKQ-EDDnp was used to determine the optimal conditions for LmrSP-4 activity. Molecular mass of LmrSP-4 was determined by MALDI-TOF and digested peptides after trypsin and Glu-C treatments were analyzed by high resolution MS/MS using different fragmentation modes.
   Results: Fraction S5 showed strong proteolytic activity upon fibrinogen. Its fractionation by reversed-phase chromatography gave rise to 6 main fractions (S5C1-S5C6). S5C1-S5C5 fractions correspond to serine proteinases whereas S5C6 represents a C-type lectin. S5C4 (named LmrSP-4) had its N-terminal determined by Edman degradation up to the 53rd amino acid residue and was chosen for characterization studies. LmrSP-4 is a fibrinogenolytic serine proteinase with high activity against S-2302, being inhibited by PMSF and benzamidine, but not by 1,10-phenantroline. In addition, this enzyme exhibited maximum activity within the pH range from neutral to basic and between 40 and 50 degrees C. About 68% of the LmrSP-4 primary structure was covered, and its molecular mass is 28,190 Da.
   Conclusions: Novel serine proteinase isoforms and a lectin were identified in LmrV. Additionally, a kallikrein-like serine proteinase that might be useful as molecular tool for investigating bradykinin-involving process was isolated and partially characterized.

TI  - Pharmacological characterization of venoms from three theraphosid spiders: <i>Poecilotheria regalis</i>, <i>Ceratogyrus darlingi</i> and <i>Brachypelma epicureanum</i>
T2  - JOURNAL OF VENOMOUS ANIMALS AND TOXINS INCLUDING TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background: Tarantulas (Theraphosidae) represent an important source of novel biologically active compounds that target a variety of ion channels and cell receptors in both insects and mammals. In this study, we evaluate and compare the pharmacological activity of venoms from three taxonomically different theraphosid spiders bred in captivity: Poecilotheria regalis, an aggressive arboreal tarantula from southeastern India; Ceratogyrus darlingi, an aggressive tarantula from southern Africa; and Brachypelma epicureanum, a docile tarantula from the Yucatan dry forest of Mexico. Prior to this study, no research had been conducted with regard to the composition and pharmacological activity of these venoms.
   Methods: The pharmacological characterization of the venoms was described for the first time by the assessment of their toxicity in crickets (LD50) along with their nociceptive (by using the formalin test), hyaluronidase, phospholipase A(2), edematogenic and caseinolytic activity.
   Results: P. regalis and B. epicureanum venoms induced a similar lethal effect on crickets (LD50 = 5.23 +/- 3.1 and 14.4 +/- 5.0 mu g protein/g 48 h post-injection, respectively), whereas C. darlingi venom (119.4 +/- 29.5 mu g protein/g 48 h post-injection) was significantly less lethal than the other two venoms. All three venoms induced similar edematogenic activity on rats but did not induce nociceptive behavior. The assessment of enzymatic activity indicated that P. regalis venom induces significantly higher hyaluronidase activity (27.6 +/- 0.9 TRU/mg) than both C. darlingi (99.7 +/- 1.9 TRU/mg) and B. epicureanum (99.6 +/- 1.6 TRU/mg); these latter venoms did not display phospholipase A(2) or caseinolytic activity.
   Conclusions: This study demonstrates that these theraphosid spiders of different habitats produce venoms with different activities. P. regalis venom displays a high level of hyaluronidase activity, which may be associated with its potentially medically significant bite.

TI  - Experimental <i>Lachesis muta rhombeata</i> envenomation and effects of soursop (<i>Annona muricata</i>) as natural antivenom
T2  - JOURNAL OF VENOMOUS ANIMALS AND TOXINS INCLUDING TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background: In the Atlantic forest of the North and Northeast regions of Brazil, local population often uses the fruit juice and the aqueous extract of leaves of soursop (Annona muricata L.) to treat Lachesis muta rhombeata envenomation. Envenomation is a relevant health issue in these areas, especially due to its severity and because the production and distribution of antivenom is limited in these regions. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relevance of the use of soursop leaf extract and its juice against envenomation by Lachesis muta rhombeata.
   Methods: We evaluated the biochemical, hematological and hemostatic parameters, the blood pressure, the inflammation process and the lethality induced by Lachesis muta rhombeata snake venom. We also assessed the action of the aqueous extract of leaves (AmL) and juice (AmJ) from A. muricata on the animal organism injected with L. m. rhombeata venom (LmrV) in the laboratory environment.
   Results: LmrV induced a decrease of total protein, albumin and glucose; and increase of creatine kinase, aspartate aminotransferase, and urea concentrations. It provoked hemoconcentration followed by reduction of hematocrit, an increase in prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time and a decrease of the blood pressure. LmrV induced the release of interleukin-6, an increase in neutrophils and changes in the serum protein profile, characteristic of the acute inflammatory process. LD50 values were similar for the groups injected with LmrV and treated or untreated with AmJ and AmL. Both treatments play a role on the maintenance of blood glucose, urea and coagulation parameters and exert a protective action against the myotoxicity. However, they seem to worsen the hypotension caused by LmrV.
   Conclusion: The treatments with AmJ and AmL present some beneficial actions, but they might intensify some effects of the venom. Therefore, additional studies on A. muricata are necessary to enable its use as natural antivenom for bushmaster snakebite.

TI  - Eave Screening and Push-Pull Tactics to Reduce House Entry by Vectors of Malaria
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Long-lasting insecticidal nets and indoor residual spraying have contributed to a decline in malaria over the last decade, but progress is threatened by the development of physiological and behavioral resistance of mosquitoes against insecticides. Acknowledging the need for alternative vector control tools, we quantified the effects of eave screening in combination with a push-pull system based on the simultaneous use of a repellent (push) and attractant-baited traps (pull). Field experiments in western Kenya showed that eave screening, whether used in combination with an attractant -baited trap or not, was highly effective in reducing house entry by malaria mosquitoes. The magnitude of the effect varied for different mosquito species and between two experiments, but the reduction in house entry was always considerable (between 61% and 99%). The use of outdoor, attractant -baited traps alone did not have a significant impact on mosquito house entry but the high number of mosquitoes trapped outdoors indicates that attractant -baited traps could be used for removal trapping, which would enhance outdoor as well as indoor protection against mosquito bites. As eave screening was effective by itself, addition of a repellent was of limited value. Nevertheless, repellents may play a role in reducing outdoor malaria transmission in the peridomestic area.

TI  - <i>Cryptosporidium</i> spp. and <i>Giardia</i> sp in aquatic mammals in northern and northeastern Brazil
T2  - DISEASES OF AQUATIC ORGANISMS
AB  - Cryptosporidium and Giardia are protozoans that can infect humans and wild and domestic animals. Due to the growing importance of diseases caused by protozoan parasites in aquatic species, we aimed to evaluate the frequency of infection by Cryptosporidium spp. and Giardia sp. in aquatic and marine mammals in the northern and northeastern regions of Brazil. We collected 553 fecal samples from 15 species of wild- ranging and captive aquatic mammals in northern and northeastern Brazil. All samples were analyzed by the Kinyoun technique for identification of Cryptosporidium spp. oocysts. Giardia sp. cysts were identified by means of the centrifugal- flotation technique in zinc sulfate solution. Subsequently, all samples were submitted for direct immunofluorescence testing. The overall frequency of infection was 15.55% (86/553) for Crypto sporidium spp. and 9.04% (50/553) for Giardia sp. The presence of Cryptosporidium spp. was detected in samples from 5 species: neotropical river otter Lontra longicaudis (15.28%), giant otter Pteronura brasiliensis (41.66%), Guiana dolphin Sotalia guianensis (9.67%), Amazonian manatee Trichechus inunguis (16.03%), and Antillean manatee T. manatus (13.79%). Giardia sp. was identified in L. longicaudis (9.23%), P. brasiliensis (29.16%), pygmy sperm whale Kogia breviceps (100%), dwarf sperm whale K. sima (25%), S. guianensis (9.67%), T. inunguis (3.81%), and T. manatus (10.34%). This is the first report of Cryptosporidium spp. in L. longicaudis, P. brasiliensis, and S. guianensis, while the occurrence of Giardia sp., in addition to the 2 otter species, was also identified in manatees, thus extending the number of hosts susceptible to these parasitic agents.

TI  - Disentangling interactions among mercury, immunity and infection in a Neotropical bat community
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - Contaminants such as mercury are pervasive and can have immunosuppressive effects on wildlife. Impaired immunity could be important for forecasting pathogen spillover, as many land-use changes that generate mercury contamination also bring wildlife into close contact with humans and domestic animals. However, the interactions among contaminants, immunity and infection are difficult to study in natural systems, and empirical tests of possible directional relationships remain rare.
   We capitalized on extreme mercury variation in a diverse bat community in Belize to test association among contaminants, immunity and infection. By comparing a previous dataset of bats sampled in 2014 with new data from 2017, representing a period of rapid agricultural land conversion, we first confirmed bat species more reliant on aquatic prey had higher fur mercury. Bats in the agricultural habitat also had higher mercury in recent years. We then tested covariation between mercury and cellular immunity and determined if such relationships mediated associations between mercury and bacterial pathogens. As bat ecology can dictate exposure to mercury and pathogens, we also assessed species-specific patterns in mercury-infection relationships.
   Across the bat community, individuals with higher mercury had fewer neutrophils but not lymphocytes, suggesting stronger associations with innate immunity. However, the odds of infection for haemoplasmas and Bartonella spp. were generally lowest in bats with high mercury, and relationships between mercury and immunity did not mediate infection patterns. Mercury also showed species- and clade-specific relationships with infection, being associated with especially low odds for haemoplasmas in Pteronotus mesoamericanus and Dermanura phaeotis. For Bartonella spp., mercury was associated with particularly low odds of infection in the genus Pteronotus but high odds in the subfamily Stenodermatinae.
   Synthesis and application. Lower general infection risk in bats with high mercury despite weaker innate defense suggests contaminant-driven loss of pathogen habitat (i.e. anemia) or vector mortality as possible causes. Greater attention to these potential pathways could help disentangle relationships among contaminants, immunity and infection in anthropogenic habitats and help forecast disease risks. Our results also suggest that contaminants may increase infection risk in some taxa but not others, emphasizing the importance of considering surveillance and management at different phylogenetic scales.

TI  - Factors influencing the use of topical repellents: implications for the effectiveness of malaria elimination strategies
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - In Cambodia, despite an impressive decline in prevalence over the last 10 years, malaria is still a public health problem in some parts of the country. This is partly due to vectors that bite early and outdoors reducing the effectiveness of measures such as Long-Lasting Insecticidal Nets. Repellents have been suggested as an additional control measure in such settings. As part of a cluster-randomized trial on the effectiveness of topical repellents in controlling malaria infections at community level, a mixed-methods study assessed user rates and determinants of use. Repellents were made widely available and Picaridin repellent reduced 97% of mosquito bites. However, despite high acceptability, daily use was observed to be low (8%) and did not correspond to the reported use in surveys (around 70%). The levels of use aimed for by the trial were never reached as the population used it variably across place (forest, farms and villages) and time (seasons), or in alternative applications (spraying on insects, on bed nets, etc.). These findings show the key role of human behavior in the effectiveness of malaria preventive measures, questioning whether malaria in low endemic settings can be reduced substantially by introducing measures without researching and optimizing community involvement strategies.

TI  - Foliar pests and pathogens of <i>Eucalyptus dunnii</i> plantations in southern Queensland
T2  - AUSTRALIAN FORESTRY
AB  - Eucalyptus dunnii is grown in plantations in subtropical Queensland, beyond its endemic distribution of northern NSW. As the plantation industry has expanded into subtropical Australia there has been an increase in the incidence of defoliating insects and foliar pathogens. This study measured the incidence and severity of damage (abiotic damage, fungal damage, insect defoliation, insect-induced necrosis and or other insect damage), four times over one year, in eight plantations aged 1, 2, 3 and 4 y where E. dunnii was the dominant species: four near Brisbane and four near Bundaberg. Multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis showed little separation between the two regions so all data for the study were combined. During the study period, the monthly rainfall was substantially lower than over the previous 30 y, particularly in all months except September to January where higher-than-average rainfall occurred in both regions. This resulted in a strong seasonal effect. The greatest damage was caused by defoliating insects (39.6% of total damage) most notably chrysomelids, followed by insect necrosis (19.2%). The pests and diseases causing most damage (e. g. chrysomelids) were present most of the year and are known to be multivoltine in subtropical regions of Australia. Only chrysomelid damage increased over the survey period, while fungal damage decreased slightly in the same period. Insect necrosis was present all year round, with most damage occurring in winter and least damage in summer. Other insect damage was highest in 1.75-3-y-old trees, peaking in winter at 9.1% in the 1.75-y-old trees. This study has provided some interesting insights into the incidence and severity of abiotic stress, pests and pathogens over four seasons. These findings may influence future plantation management of pests and diseases in establishing plantations.

TI  - Building an explanatory model for snakebite envenoming care in the Brazilian Amazon from the indigenous caregivers' perspective
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Author summaryThe Brazilian Amazon is the region of the Americas that has the highest incidence of SBEs, and indigenous populations are disproportionately affected. In order for Brazil to achieve a reduction in mortality and disability from snakebite envenomations, it is vital to understand how indigenous and professional healthcare sectors interact in indigenous villages. The indigenous caregivers interviewed explained that the occurrence of a snakebite can be a natural event, usually due to the lack of attention of an indigenous person during their daily activities in the forest, or a supernatural event that was caused as a punishment or by witchcraft. The latter type of snakebites is more serious and it is difficult to intervene to promote healing. Indigenous caregivers recommend a series of rituals in order to protect an individual from snakebite or heal the already diseased body. In addition, a series of therapeutic resources derived from plants and animals is used for treatment and rehabilitation of the indigenous person. In this itinerary, there is no impediment on the part of the caregivers to include a stay in hospital in order to carry out the treatment with antivenom and other care deemed necessary by the doctors. This finding is crucial to improve the effectiveness of snakebite treatment in an integrated biomedical-indigenous model, thus reducing the contradictions and tensions present in the daily practices of both health teams and indigenous caregivers. The engagement with local caregivers to combine the indigenous health care model with a timely referral of SBE patients to a facility equipped with antivenom is a major determinant of success in the control of SBEs.
   BackgroundIn the Brazilian Amazon, snakebite envenomings (SBE) disproportionately affect indigenous peoples. Communication between indigenous and biomedical health sectors in regards to SBEs has never been explored in this region. This study aims to build an explanatory model (EM) of the indigenous healthcare domain for SBE patients from the perspective of the indigenous caregivers. Methodology/Principal findingsThis is a qualitative study involving in-depth interviews of eight indigenous caregivers who are representatives of the Tikuna, Kokama and Kambeba ethnic groups, in the Alto Solimoes River, western Brazilian Amazon. Data analysis was carried out via deductive thematic analysis. A framework was built containing the explanations based on three explanatory model (EM) components: etiology, course of sickness, and treatment. To indigenous caregivers, snakes are enemies and present conscience and intention. Snakebites have a natural or a supernatural cause, the last being more difficult to prevent and treat. Use of ayahuasca tea is a strategy used by some caregivers to identify the underlying cause of the SBE. Severe or lethal SBEs are understood as having been triggered by sorcery. Treatment is characterized by four components: i) immediate self-care; ii) first care in the village, mostly including tobacco smoking, chants and prayers, combined with the intake of animal bile and emetic plants; iii) a stay in a hospital, to receive antivenom and other treatments; iv) care in the village after hospital discharge, which is a phase of re-establishment of well-being and reintroduction into social life, using tobacco smoking, massages and compresses to the affected limb, and teas of bitter plants. Dietary taboos and behavioral interdictions (avoiding contact with menstruating and pregnant women) prevent complications, relapses, and death, and must be performed up to three months after the snakebite. Caregivers are in favor of antivenom treatment in indigenous areas. Conclusions/SignificanceThere is a potential for articulation between different healthcare sectors to improve the management of SBEs in the Amazon region, and the aim is to decentralize antivenom treatment so that it occurs in indigenous health centers with the active participation of the indigenous caregivers.

TI  - Unravelling the relationships between <i>Anopheles darlingi</i> (Diptera: Culicidae) densities, environmental factors and malaria incidence: understanding the variable patterns of malarial transmission in French Guiana (South America)
T2  - ANNALS OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND PARASITOLOGY
AB  - Anopheles darlingi, one of the main malaria vectors in the Neotropics, is widely distributed in French Guiana, where malaria remains a major public-health problem. Elucidation of the relationships between the population dynamics of An. darlingi and local environmental factors would appear to be an essential factor in the epidemiology of human malaria in French Guiana and the design of effective vector-control strategies. In a recent investigation, longitudinal entomological surveys were carried out for 2-4 years in one village in each of three distinct endemic areas of French Guiana. Anopheles darlingi was always the anopheline mosquito that was most frequently caught on human bait, although its relative abundance (as a proportion of all the anophelines collected) and human biting rate (in bites/person-year) differed with the study site. Seasonality in the abundance of human-landing An. darlingi (with peaks at the end of the rainy season) was observed in only two of the three study sites. Just three An. darlingi were found positive for Plasmodium (either P. falciparum or P. vivax) circumsporozoite protein, giving entomological inoculation rates of 0.0-8.7 infectious bites/person-year. Curiously, no infected An. darlingi were collected in the village with the highest incidence of human malaria. Relationships between malaria incidence, An. darlingi densities, rainfall and water levels in the nearest rivers were found to be variable and apparently dependent on land-cover specificities that reflected the diversity and availability of habitats suitable for the development and reproduction of An. darlingi.

TI  - Acute toxoplasmoses in immunocompetent patients hospitalized in an intensive care unit in French Guiana
T2  - CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY AND INFECTION
AB  - Clin Microbiol Infect 2012; 18: E221E231 Abstract Atypical Toxoplasma gondii strains, unrelated to archetypal clonal lineages (I, II, III), have been reported more frequently over the last decade in areas other than Europe and North America. A newly described form of toxoplasmosis, Amazonian toxoplasmosis (AT), has been reported since 2002 in French Guiana. It is characterized by severe cases and atypical strains linked to a neotropical forest-based cycle. We report on the cases of AT that required intensive care management. We performed a prospective observational study on hospitalized adults in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) from 2002 to 2008. Clinical and laboratory data, microbiological findings and outcomes were recorded. Data, including the ICU simplified acute physiology score and the pneumonia severity index, were calculated. Epidemiological risk factors for AT were assessed through questionnaires. Eleven non-immunodeficient patients were admitted to the ICU in Cayenne for life-threatening pneumonia associated with disseminated toxoplasmosis. Mechanical ventilation was necessary in seven patients, four of whom required immediate orotracheal intubation. Cardiac and ophthalmological abnormalities were found in five and four patients, respectively. One patient died from multiple organ failure. The genetic characterization of Toxoplasma DNA using six microsatellite markers revealed unique and atypical genotypes in eight patients. All patients presented epidemiological risk factors for AT. In French Guiana, significant T.similar to gondii-related infectious syndrome associated with the lungs, a high level of LDH activity and the reported risk factors for AT was strongly suggestive of disseminated toxoplasmosis with a possible trend toward life-threatening pneumonia.

TI  - History and Contemporary Perspectives of the Integrated Pest Management of Soybean in Brazil
T2  - NEOTROPICAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - The integrated pest management (IPM) of soybean developed and implemented in Brazil was one of the most successful programs of pest management in the world. Established during the 1970s, it showed a tremendous level of adoption by growers, decreasing the amount of insecticide use by over 50%. It included outstanding approaches of field scouting and decision making, considering the economic injury levels (EILs) for the major pests. Two main biological control programs were highly important to support the soybean IPM program in Brazil, i.e., the use of a NPVAg to control the major defoliator, the velvet bean caterpillar, Anticarsia gemmatalis Hubner, and the use of egg parasitoids against the seed-sucking stink bugs, in particular, the southern green stink bug, Nezara viridula (L.). These two biological control programs plus pests scouting, and the use of more selective insecticides considering the EILs supported the IPM program through the 1980s and 1990s. With the change in the landscape, with the adoption of the no-tillage cultivation system and the introduction of more intense multiple cropping, and with the lower input to divulge and adapt the IPM program to this new reality, the program started to decline during the years 2000s. Nowadays, soybean IPM is almost a forgotten control technology. In this mini-review article, suggestions are made to possibly revive and adapt the soybean IPM to contemporary time.

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Distribution of Leafhoppers (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) in a Corn Field
T2  - NEOTROPICAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - Leafhoppers (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) are phytophagous insects that transmit diseases and cause damage to this crop. Thus, the main goal of this study was to verify the spatiotemporal behavior of the leafhoppers Tapajosa ocellata (Osborn, 1926), Dechacona missionum (Berg, 1879), and Dalbulus maidis (DeLong, 1923) in a corn field in Igarape-Acu, northeastern Para, northern Brazil. An area of 1.0 ha was used for the development of the study. A mango agroecosystem, a pasture, and secondary forest fragment are adjacent to the experimental area. The sampling of leafhoppers occurred during the 2015 and 2016 harvests. For sampling, 10 random plants per plot were analyzed, totaling 1000 plants per sample. In order to verify the occurrence of leafhoppers, all aerial parts of the plants were analyzed visually. The spatiotemporal behavior of leafhoppers and influence of adjacent areas and phenological stages of corn were verified through geostatistics. From the composition of semivariograms, interpolation maps were constructed by kriging. The results showed that, in 2015, there was a higher incidence of D. maidis compared to the following year. In 2016, 352 individuals of T. ocellata and 66 of D. missionum were observed. Regarding the spatial distribution, it was found that the smallest area of influence of T. ocellata, D. missionum, and D. maidis was 0.09, 0.08, and 0.05 ha, respectively. The spatial distribution of leafhoppers showed an aggregate behavior concentrated close to adjacent areas with a predominance of grasses. Population fluctuation demonstrated that the highest incidence of leafhoppers occurs in the vegetative stages of corn.

TI  - Antifungal potential of crude extracts of <i>Trichoderma</i> spp.
T2  - BIOTA NEOTROPICA
AB  - Antibiosis is the mechanism by which certain microorganisms respond to the presence of others, secreting compounds or metabolites capable of inhibiting or impeding their development. The crude extract of Trichoderma contains a mixture of secondary compounds, which may show antibiotic effect, and has been used for the prospect of this fungus for biological control and other industrial purposes. Faced with the increasing demand of agriculture for ecologically compatible alternatives for the management of diseases, this work aimed to investigate the spectrum of action of Non-Volatile Metabolites (NVMs) of Trichoderma isolates against different plant pathogenic fungi. The antagonistic potential of NVMs was evaluated through the incorporation method of the filtered liquid extract in PDA medium. The assays showed that all the NVMs produced inhibited the fungus Sclerotinia sclerotiorum similarly. On the other hand, strains CEN1245 and CEN1274, both belonging to the species Trichoderma brevicompactum, showed broad spectrum against Sclerotium rolfsii, Colletotrichum gloesporioides, Verticillium dahliae, Fusarium oxysporum and Cylindrocladium sp. The present study describes isolates producing non-volatile metabolites with broad spectrum of antifungal action, as well as pathogen-specific. The Trichoderma spp. NVMs obtained from different soil samples cultivated with vegetables, cassava and maize were efficient in inhibiting plant pathogenic fungi belonging to other patossystems, such as forest or fruit, which could increase their potential application in biological control of plant diseases. In addition, these antagonistic fungi should be studied in greater depth for the identification of bioactive molecules of industrial interest or in commercial formulations of products for biological control of plant pathogens.

TI  - Implementing poultry vaccination and biosecurity at the village level in Tanzania: a social strategy to promote health in free-range poultry populations
T2  - TROPICAL ANIMAL HEALTH AND PRODUCTION
AB  - A social strategy was tested for implementing Newcastle disease (ND) vaccination and biosecurity improvements among free-ranging chicken at village level in Tanzania. In addition to training the local poultry vaccinators, data recorders and poultry-keepers, the strategy involved training and empowering leaders at the district, ward and village level. The trainings covered poultry health, management, and marketing of village chickens, with an emphasis on ND vaccination and improving biosecurity against avian influenza (AI), The study sites included villages in one ward in each of three each three districts (Iringa, Mtwara-Mikindani, and Mvomero) of mainland Tanzania. Ninety-six local leaders at district level and 101 leaders at ward levels were trained. In addition, 196 farmers (households) were trained, as well as 86 vaccinators and 26 data recorders. Data recorders were also trained as poultry first aid workers. ND vaccination was conducted by the vaccinators, supervised by their local leaders with technical assistance from veterinarians. A total of 158,343 village chickens were vaccinated in three rounds of vaccination three months apart. The training and empowerment of local leaders and local implementers was the key element for success as it fostered the feeling of local ownership of the program and prevented conflicts with other development activities within the villages. We conclude that most animal health programs will increase their odds of success by involving local leaders and by addressing the current challenges facing the farmers. Further assessment on the usefulness of this approach is needed.

TI  - The demography of <i>Atelopus</i> decline: Harlequin frog survival and abundance in central Panama prior to and during a disease outbreak
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - Harlequin frogs (Bufonidae: Atelopus) are a species-rich genus of Neotropical toads that have experienced disproportionately severe population declines and extinctions caused by the amphibian chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). The genus Atelopus is of high conservation concern, but relatively little is known about the population dynamics and life history of the majority of species. We examined the demography of one population of Atelopus zeteki and two populations of A. varius in central Panama using three to six years of mark-recapture data collected prior to and during an outbreak of Bd. We estimated male survival probabilities prior to the arrival of Bd and sex-specific population sizes for these three populations using state-space Bayesian population models. Prior to the arrival of Bd, monthly apparent survival probabilities were higher for A. varius males than for A. zeteki males, and recaptures among years were low in both species. Abundance of both species varied over time and declined rapidly after the arrival of Bd. Male densities were generally greater than female densities, though female densities were higher or equivalent to males after the arrival of Bd. Estimates of survival and abundance over time may be explained by differences in the use of stream habitat by the two sexes and three populations, both during and between breeding seasons. These estimates provide key baseline population information that can be used to inform reintroductions from captive assurance colonies and studies of extant Atelopus populations as part of conservation and management programs.

TI  - The vectoring of <i>Starmerella</i> species and other yeasts by stingless bees in a Neotropical savanna
T2  - FUNGAL ECOLOGY
AB  - In Brazilian savannas, stingless bees are associated with yeast communities composed mainly of Starmerella species. This study aimed to establish the distribution of yeasts associated with the bee species Frieseomelitta varia, Scaptotrigona aff. postica, Scaptotrigona polysticta, Tetragonisca angustula angustula, Melipona compressipes manaosensis and Melipona scutellaris in northern savannas and the importance of yeasts in the resource partitioning of bees. We collected 380 bees from six species, which were individually placed in Petri plates containing rich medium for 15 min. Yeasts were then isolated, resulting in the identification of 54 species, 48 of which were ascomycetous, while six were basidiomycetous. Torulaspora delbrueckii was the most frequently isolated yeast species in this study, followed by Pichia membranifaciens, Starmerella apicola, Pichia kluyveri, Starmerella meliponinorum and Starmerella bombicola. The total number of Starmerella species identified showed that these species are prevalent in association with these stingless bees. These communities differ from stingless bee-associated yeasts found in the southern savannas of Brazil. Although stingless bees are generalist foragers, there are some yeasts showing high prevalence in only one bee species, resulting in differences in niche breadth that may point to a role of yeasts in the resource partitioning of bees in Brazilian savannas.

TI  - Multilocus sequence typing reveals two distinct populations of "<i>Candidatus</i> Phytoplasma sacchari" in China
T2  - TROPICAL PLANT PATHOLOGY
AB  - Sugarcane white leaf (SCWL), associated with the presence of "Candidatus Phytoplasma sacchari," is a devastating disease. In this study, a multilocus sequence typing (MLST) scheme based on seven housekeeping genes (dnaK, tuf, secY, gyrB, secA, recA, and hflB) was applied to examine the genetic diversity and population structure of "Ca. P. sacchari." Using this MLST scheme, 87 "Ca. P. sacchari" infected sugarcane samples from Yunnan province, China, were analyzed, and two sequence types (STs) were identified. ST1 is the most widely distributed and is the main ST, whereas ST2 is only found in the Baoshan area in China. Analysis of the population structure showed that the ST1 and ST2 "Ca. P. sacchari" were the different populations. The nucleotide diversity of the seven housekeeping genes ranged from 0 to 0.00268, indicating that the genetic diversity of "Ca. P. sacchari" in China is very low. The MLST scheme developed offers researchers a valuable typing tool for epidemiology and diversity studies of "Ca. P. sacchari."

TI  - Genetic diversity of Nyssorhynchus (Anopheles) darlingi related to biting behavior in western Amazon
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
AB  - BackgroundIn the Amazon Basin, Nyssorhynchus (Anopheles) darlingi is the most aggressive and effective malaria vector. In endemic areas, behavioral aspects of anopheline vectors such as host preference, biting time and resting location post blood meal have a key impact on malaria transmission dynamics and vector control interventions. Nyssorhynchus darlingi presents a range of feeding and resting behaviors throughout its broad distribution.MethodsTo investigate the genetic diversity related to biting behavior, we collected host-seeking Ny. darlingi in two settlement types in Acre, Brazil: Granada (20-year-old, more established, better access by road, few malaria cases) and Remansinho (8-year-old, active logging, poor road access, high numbers malaria cases). Mosquitoes were classified by the location of collection (indoors or outdoors) and time (dusk or dawn).ResultsGenome-wide SNPs, used to assess the degree of genetic divergence and population structure, identified non-random distributions of individuals in the PCA for both location and time analyses. Although genetic diversity related to behavior was confirmed by non-model-based analyses and F-ST values, model-based STRUCTURE detected considerable admixture of these populations.ConclusionsTo our knowledge, this is the first study to detect genetic markers associated with biting behavior in Ny. darlingi. Additional ecological and genomic studies may help to understand the genetic basis of mosquito behavior and address appropriate surveillance and vector control.

TI  - Distribution of races and <i>Tox</i> genes in <i>Pyrenophora tritici</i>-<i>repentis</i> isolates from wheat in Argentina
T2  - TROPICAL PLANT PATHOLOGY
AB  - Tan spot, caused by Pyrenophora tritici-repentis, is a common disease in wheat-growing regions of Argentina. In this study 65 isolates of P. tritici-repentis obtained from different cultivars and wheat regions of Argentina were assessed for their virulence on six wheat cultivars/lines (Glenlea, Salomouni, Katepwa, M-3, 6B365 and 6B662) and for the presence/absence of the Tox genes based on a PCR approach. Thirty-six isolates were assigned to races, of which races 4 and 8 were dominant. Results for molecular analysis of ToxA, ToxB, ToxB-like and toxb genes showed that 57 isolates possessed the ToxA gene whereas only one isolate possessed ToxA and ToxB genes. There was no correlation between races and the toxin genotypes. It is suggested that P. tritici-repentis exhibits a complex race structure in Argentina.

TI  - Prevalence and characteristics of malaria among COVID-19 individuals: A systematic review, meta-analysis, and analysis of case reports
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   The world population is currently at a very high risk of Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). People who live in malaria-endemic areas and get infected by SARS-CoV-2 may be at increased risk of severe COVID-19 or unfavorable disease outcomes if they ignore their malaria status. Therefore, the present study aimed to synthesize, qualitatively and quantitatively, information on the prevalence and characteristics of malaria infection among COVID-19-infected individuals. The findings will help us better understand this particular comorbidity during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p> Methods
   The systematic review protocol was registered at the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) with the identification number: CRD42021247521. We searched for studies reporting on the coinfection of COVID-19 and malaria in PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus from inception to March 27, 2021 using Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms. The study's methodological quality in the search output was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Tools for cross-sectional study. The pooled prevalence of Plasmodium spp. infection among patients infected with COVID-19 was estimated using the random effect model and then graphically presented as forest plots. The heterogeneity among the included studies was assessed using Cochrane Q and I-2 statistics. The characteristics of patients co-infected with COVID-19 and malaria were derived from case reports and series and were formally analyzed using simple statistics.</p> Results
   Twelve of 1,207 studies reporting the coinfection of COVID-19 and malaria were selected for further analysis. Results of quantitative synthesis show that the pooled prevalence of Plasmodium spp. infection (364 cases) among COVID-19 individuals (1,126 cases) is 11%, with a high degree of heterogeneity (95% CI: 4%-18%, I-2: 97.07%, 5 studies). Most of the coinfections were reported in Nigeria (336 cases), India (27 cases), and the Democratic Republic of Congo (1 case). Results of qualitative synthesis indicate that patients with coinfection are typically symptomatic at presentation with mild or moderate parasitemia. An analysis of case reports and series indicates that co-infected individuals often display thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, and elevated bilirubin levels. Among four patients (30%) who required treatment with intravenous artesunate, one experienced worsened clinical status after administering the drug. One serious outcome of coinfection involved a pregnant woman who experienced fetal abortion due to the initial misdiagnosis of malaria.</p> Conclusions
   All individuals in malaria-endemic regions who are febrile or display symptoms of COVID-19 should be evaluated for malaria to avoid serious complications. Further prospective studies are required to investigate the burden and outcomes of COVID-19 in malaria-endemic regions. Prompt management is required to prevent serious outcomes in individuals co-infected with COVID-19 and malaria.</p>
   Author summary
   The world population is currently at a high risk of Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). People who live in malaria-endemic areas and get infected by SARS-CoV-2 may be at an increased risk of severe COVID-19 if they are co-infected with malaria. Therefore, we aim to demonstrate the prevalence and characteristics of malaria infections among COVID-19-infected individuals. From the systematic literature review, we showed that the prevalence of Plasmodium spp. infection among patients with COVID-19 is 11%. Most of the coinfections were reported in Nigeria, India, and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Moreover, we showed that patients with coinfections are typically symptomatic at presentation with mild or moderate parasitemia. We also indicated that patients with coinfections often display thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, and elevated bilirubin levels. Among four patients with coinfections and severe diseases, one experienced worsened clinical status after administration of the anti-malarial drug. One of the patients, a pregnant woman, experienced a serious outcome of coinfection, fetal abortion, due to the initial misdiagnosis of malaria. Based on our study, further prospective studies must investigate the burden and outcomes of COVID-19 in malaria-endemic regions. Further prompt management is necessary to prevent severe outcomes in patients co-infected with COVID-19 and malaria.</p>

TI  - What Factors Might Have Led to the Emergence of Ebola in West Africa?
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - An Ebola outbreak of unprecedented scope emerged in West Africa in December 2013 and presently continues unabated in the countries of Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia. Ebola is not new to Africa, and outbreaks have been confirmed as far back as 1976. The current West African Ebola outbreak is the largest ever recorded and differs dramatically from prior outbreaks in its duration, number of people affected, and geographic extent. The emergence of this deadly disease in West Africa invites many questions, foremost among these: why now, and why in West Africa? Here, we review the sociological, ecological, and environmental drivers that might have influenced the emergence of Ebola in this region of Africa and its spread throughout the region. Containment of the West African Ebola outbreak is the most pressing, immediate need. A comprehensive assessment of the drivers of Ebola emergence and sustained human-to-human transmission is also needed in order to prepare other countries for importation or emergence of this disease. Such assessment includes identification of country-level protocols and interagency policies for outbreak detection and rapid response, increased understanding of cultural and traditional risk factors within and between nations, delivery of culturally embedded public health education, and regional coordination and collaboration, particularly with governments and health ministries throughout Africa. Public health education is also urgently needed in countries outside of Africa in order to ensure that risk is properly understood and public concerns do not escalate unnecessarily. To prevent future outbreaks, coordinated, multiscale, early warning systems should be developed that make full use of these integrated assessments, partner with local communities in high-risk areas, and provide clearly defined response recommendations specific to the needs of each community.

TI  - Mosquito-Disseminated Pyriproxyfen Yields High Breeding-Site Coverage and Boosts Juvenile Mosquito Mortality at the Neighborhood Scale
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   Mosquito-borne pathogens pose major public health challenges worldwide. With vaccines or effective drugs still unavailable for most such pathogens, disease prevention heavily relies on vector control. To date, however, mosquito control has proven difficult, with low breeding-site coverage during control campaigns identified as a major drawback. A novel tactic exploits the egg-laying behavior of mosquitoes to have them disseminate tiny particles of a potent larvicide, pyriproxyfen (PPF), from resting to breeding sites, thus improving coverage. This approach has yielded promising results at small spatial scales, but its wider applicability remains unclear.
   Methodology/Principal Findings
   We conducted a four-month trial within a 20-month study to investigate mosquito-driven dissemination of PPF dust-particles from 100 'dissemination stations' (DSs) deployed in a 7-ha sub-area to surveillance dwellings and sentinel breeding sites (SBSs) distributed over an urban neighborhood of about 50 ha. We assessed the impact of the trial by measuring juvenile mosquito mortality and adult mosquito emergence in each SBS-month. Using data from 1,075 dwelling-months, 2,988 SBS-months, and 29,922 individual mosquitoes, we show that mosquito-disseminated PPF yielded high coverage of dwellings (up to 100%) and SBSs (up to 94.3%). Juvenile mosquito mortality in SBSs (about 4% at baseline) increased by over one order of magnitude during PPF dissemination (about 75%). This led to a > 10-fold decrease of adult mosquito emergence from SBSs, from approximately 1,000-3,000 adults/month before to about 100 adults/month during PPF dissemination.
   Conclusions/Significance
   By expanding breeding-site coverage and boosting juvenile mosquito mortality, a strategy based on mosquito-disseminated PPF has potential to substantially enhance mosquito control. Sharp declines in adult mosquito emergence can lower vector/host ratios, reducing the risk of disease outbreaks. This approach is a very promising complement to current and novel mosquito control strategies; it will probably be especially relevant for the control of urban disease vectors, such as Aedes and Culex species, that often cause large epidemics.

TI  - Assessing the molecular divergence between <i>Anopheles</i> (<i>Kerteszia</i>) <i>cruzii</i> populations from Brazil using the <i>timeless</i> gene: further evidence of a species complex
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
AB  - Background: Anopheles (Kerteszia) cruzii was the most important vector of human malaria in southern Brazil between 1930-1960. Nowadays it is still considered an important Plasmodium spp. vector in southern and south-eastern Brazil, incriminated for oligosymptomatic malaria. Previous studies based on the analysis of X chromosome banding patterns and inversion frequencies in An. cruzii populations from these areas have suggested the occurrence of three sibling species. In contrast, two genetically distinct groups among An. cruzii populations from south/south-east and north-east Brazil have been revealed by isoenzyme analysis. Therefore, An. cruzii remains unclear.
   Methods: In this study, a partial sequence of the timeless gene (similar to 400 bp), a locus involved in the control of circadian rhythms, was used as a molecular marker to assess the genetic differentiation between An. cruzii populations from six geographically distinct areas of Brazil.
   Results: The timeless gene revealed that An. cruzii from Itaparica Island, Bahia State (north-east Brazil), constitutes a highly differentiated group compared with the other five populations from south and south-east Brazil. In addition, significant genetic differences were also observed among some of the latter populations.
   Conclusion: Analysis of the genetic differentiation in the timeless gene among An. cruzii populations from different areas of Brazil indicated that this malaria vector is a complex of at least two cryptic species. The data also suggest that further work might support the occurrence of other siblings within this complex in Brazil.

TI  - Seasonal Effects on Body Condition and Characteristics of the Estrous Cycle in Captive Asian Elephants (<i>Elephas maximus</i>) in Thailand: A Retrospective Study
T2  - ANIMALS
AB  - Simple Summary: Thailand is in the tropics, with high temperatures, humidity, and long daylight hours. Seasons affecting estrous cycles have been discovered in the semi-captive Asian elephant in Thailand. In addition, seasonality in reproduction has been reported in sows and cows in the tropic environment. Despite the fact that measurements of the body condition score (BCS) have served as a disease diagnostic tool in terms of screening undernourishment and obesity in veterinarian practice and have been developed and applied in captive elephants, obesity is a growing concern today. The consequences of being overweight are typically not recognized until welfare-related reproductive dysfunctions, such as higher neonate weight, stillbirth, and acyclicity, are present. In captive-managed elephants, ovarian dysfunction and estrous cycling abnormalities are common, which are linked to a variety of issues such as obesity, reproductive tract pathologies, and metabolic derangements. These problems are most likely to contribute to poor reproductive health and then lead to undesirable reproduction. Thus, it is critical and urgent to identify the factors affecting reproductive health and ovarian patterns and thus facilitate fertility. The data for this study were collected from eight captive female elephants. During the rainy, hot, and cool seasons, their BCS was measured. Characteristics of the estrous cycle were studied, including the length of the estrous cycle and the lengths and starts of the luteal phase and follicular phase. The findings revealed that a higher BCS and the start of the follicular phase were highly frequent during the rainy season, which resulted in a longer luteal phase and estrous cycle and higher peak progesterone levels in the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus).
   The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of season on the body condition score (BCS), the characteristics of the estrous cycle (luteal phase [LPL], follicular phase [FPL], estrous cycle [ECL] lengths, and the start of the luteal phase [SLP] and follicular phase [SFP]), and progesterone levels (baseline and peak) of eight captive Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) in Thailand. From 2014 to 2019, blood samples were collected weekly for serum progesterone enzyme immunoassays (EIAs). Estrous cycles (n = 70), including the luteal and follicular phases, and BCS (n = 70) were recorded. Based on the BCS, the LPL, FPL, and ECL were assigned to the following two groups: normal (BCS = 3.0-4.0, n = 38) and overweight (BCS = 4.5-5.0, n = 32). The findings demonstrated that there was no difference in LPL between the groups. However, in the normal group, the ECL was one week longer (14.9 +/- 1.7 vs. 13.9 +/- 1.7 weeks; p < 0.05), and the FPL also tended to be one week longer (7.2 +/- 1.7 vs. 6.4 +/- 1.5 weeks; p = 0.06) than in the overweight group. The mean progesterone level during the rainy, hot, and cool seasons was not statistically different. Based on the yearly averaged BCS from three seasons, the baseline and peak levels of progesterone were classified into the normal (n = 16) and overweight (n = 12) groups. Females with a normal BCS tended to exhibit higher progesterone peak levels (p = 0.08). The majority of peaks appeared during the rainy season (53.57%). The BCS was highest during the hot (4.47) and rainy (4.38) seasons, but not during the cool (4.12) season. The LPL, FPL, and ECL were not affected by the season in which the luteal phase occurred. On the other hand, the rainy season had a significant effect on the SFP, resulting in a longer LPL (p < 0.05) and ECL (p = 0.01); both were the longest during the rainy season. In conclusion, the effects of season on BCS may be related to characteristics of the estrous cycle and peak progesterone levels. Ultimately, these findings provide ground knowledge to assist elephant managers and owners in planning breeding activities using seasonal effects and BCS measurements in tropical climates.

TI  - Overexpression of OsWRKY72 gene interferes in the abscisic acid signal and auxin transport pathway of Arabidopsis
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOSCIENCES
AB  - Through activating specific transcriptional programmes, plants can launch resistance mechanisms to stressful environments and acquire a new equilibrium between development and defence. To screen the rice WRKY transcription factor which functions in abiotic stress tolerance and modulates the abscisic acid (ABA) response, we generated a whole array of 35S-OsWRKY transgenic Arabidopsis. In this study, we report that 35S-OsWRKY72 transgenic Arabidopsis, whose seed germination was retarded under normal conditions, emerged more sensitive to mannitol, NaCl, ABA stresses and sugar starvation than vector plants. Meanwhile, 35S-OsWRKY72 transgenic Arabidopsis displayed early flowering, reduced apical dominance, lost high temperature-induced hypocotyl elongation response, and enhanced gravitropism response, which were similar to the auxin-related gene mutants aux1, axr1 and bud1. Further, semi-quantitative RT-PCR showed that the expression patterns of three auxin-related genes AUX1, AXR1 and BUD1 were significantly altered in rosette leaves and inflorescences of 35S-OsWRKY72 plants compared with control Arabidopsis, and two ABA-related genes ABA2 and ABI4 were induced in 35S-OsWRKY72 seedlings. In addition, northern blot analysis indicated that, in rice, OsWRKY72 was inducible by polyethylene glycol (PEG), NaCl, naphthalene acetic acid (NAA), ABA and 42A degrees C, similar to its orthologue AtWRKY75 in Arabidopsis, implying that these two WRKY genes might be required for multiple physiological processes in their plants. Together, these results suggest that OsWRKY72 interferes in the signal cross-talk between the ABA signal and auxin transport pathway in transgenic Arabidopsis.

TI  - Machine learning-based characterization of hydrochar from biomass: Implications for sustainable energy and material production
T2  - FUEL
AB  - Hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) is a process that converts biomass into versatile hydrochar without the need for prior drying. The physicochemical properties of hydrochar are influenced by biomass properties and processing parameters, making it challenging to optimize for specific applications through trial-and-error experiments. To save time and money, machine learning can be used to develop a model that characterizes hydrochar produced from different biomass sources under varying reaction processing parameters. Thus, this study aims to develop an inclusive model to characterize hydrochar using a database covering a range of biomass types and reaction processing parameters. The quality and quantity of hydrochar are predicted using two models (decision tree regression and support vector regression). The decision tree regression model outperforms the support vector regression model in terms of forecast accuracy (R-2 > 0.88, RMSE < 6.848, and MAE < 4.718). Using an evolutionary algorithm, optimum inputs are identified based on cost functions provided by the selected model to optimize hydrochar for energy production, soil amendment, and pollutant adsorption, resulting in hydrochar yields of 84.31%, 84.91%, and 80.40%, respectively. The feature importance analysis reveals that biomass ash/ carbon content and operating temperature are the primary factors affecting hydrochar production in the HTC process.

TI  - GRASSLAND IMPROVEMENT IN SUBTROPICAL GUANGDONG PROVINCE, CHINA .3. STRATEGY FOR IMPROVEMENT OF ACID SOILS
T2  - TROPICAL GRASSLANDS
AB  - This paper reports a strategy for improvement of the acid Hapludult soils found in north Guangdong Province, China.  These soils are so infertile that productive pastures cannot be developed without first improving the soil.  Rebuilding soil fertility is a slow and costly process which requires manipulation of pasture species and fertiliser inputs to raise the soil organic matter level and thereby increase the cation exchange capacity.  Three stages of soil improvement-pasture development are described through which individual paddocks may advance before high beef production can be realised.  A molasses grass - round-leafed cassia mixture which responds to low rates of P and K is recommended for Stage 1 improvement on unlimed soil.  This combination has low palatability to cattle, but the yields of above 11 000 kg/ha DM top and root growth should significantly increase the level of soil organic matter.  With moderate P and K inputs and some soil improvement in Stage 1, better quality species such as setaria sown with lotononis or Oxley stylo show promise for summer grazing by cattle on unlimed soil in Stage 2 improvement.  Lime application may further increase the range of quality summer grasses and some temperate species during Stage 2.  However, only after several years of rebuilding soil fertility and nutrient recycling under grazing can high producing Stage 3 subtropical and temperate species be sustained without high annual fertiliser and lime inputs.  Cash crops and forage crops can be used in rotation with permanent pasture and strategic use of lime to diversify income, provide more cattle feed at critical periods, stop weed invasion and break insect and disease cycles.  Changes in pasture composition (succession or retrogression) provide a useful guide to changes in soil fertility.  While further research is required to refine the low-input, soil-improvement strategy described, this approach appears most likely to lead to sustained pasture development on the red soils in south China.

TI  - IN-VITRO EVALUATION OF ANTAGONISTIC <i>TRICHODERMA</i> STRAINS FOR ERADICATING <i>PHELLINUS NOXIUS</i> IN COLONISED WOOD
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL FOREST SCIENCE
AB  - The aim of the present in-vitro studies was to identify Trichoderma strains from Hong Kong with highly antagonistic potential against the basidiomycete Phellinus noxius. Dual culture and interaction tests using samples of balsa wood (Ochroma lagopus) as well as studies on fungal growth at different temperatures and water activities were conducted. The impact of Trichoderma strains on wood colonisation and decomposition by three P. noxius isolates were quantitatively analysed by measuring dry weight loss and rate of eradication of the pathogen from the test wood. Most Trichoderma strains revealed antagonistic potential against P. noxius. In the wood blocks incubated with P. noxius and then treated with Trichoderma T-TMS1 for 24 weeks, 100% eradication of three P. noxius isolates was recorded. The results indicated that application of Trichoderma strains might be a promising and environmentally benign method of eradicating P. noxius from wood debris in soils.

TI  - A SURVEY FOR <i>BATRACHOCHYTRIUM DENDROBATIDIS</i> IN ENDANGERED AND HIGHLY SUSCEPTIBLE VIETNAMESE SALAMANDERS (<i>TYLOTOTRITON</i> SPP.)
T2  - JOURNAL OF ZOO AND WILDLIFE MEDICINE
AB  - Until now, Asian amphibians appear to have largely escaped declines driven by chytridiomycosis. Vietnamese salamanders that belong to the genus Tylototriton are rare and have a patchy distribution in mountainous areas, falling within the proposed environmental envelope of chytrid infections, surrounded by Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis infected regions. If these salamanders are susceptible to chytridiomycosis, then their populations could be highly vulnerable after the introduction of B. dendrobatidis. Examination for the presence of the chytrid fungus in skin swabs from 19 Tylototriton asperrimus and 104 Tylototriton vietnamensis by using quantitative polymerase chain reaction was performed. Susceptibility of T. asperrimus to experimental infection by using the global panzootic lineage (BdGPL) strain of B. dendrobatidis was examined. The fungus was absent in all samples from all wild salamanders examined. Inoculation with the BdGPL strain resulted in mortality of all five inoculated salamanders within 3 weeks after inoculation with infected animals that manifested severe orthokeratotic hyperkeratosis, epidermal hyperplasia, and spongiosis. Although infection by B. dendrobatidis currently appears absent in Vietnamese Tylototriton populations, the rarity of these animals, their pronounced susceptibility to chytridiomycosis, an apparently suitable environmental context and increasing likelihood of the pathogen being introduced, together suggest the need of urgent measures to avoid future scenarios of extinction as witnessed in Central America and Australia.
