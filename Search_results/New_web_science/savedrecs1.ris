TI  - Promoting landscapes with a low zoonotic disease risk through forest restoration: The need for comprehensive guidelines
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - Zoonotic diseases represent 75% of emerging infectious diseases worldwide, and their emergence is mainly attributed to human-driven changes in landscapes. Land use change, especially the conversion of natural areas to agricultural use, has the potential to impact hosts and vector dynamics, affecting pathogen transmission risk. While these links are becoming better understood, very few studies have investigated the opposite question-how native vegetation restoration affects zoonotic disease outbreaks. We reviewed the existing evidence linking native vegetation restoration with zoonotic transmission risk, identified knowledge gaps, and, by focusing on tropical areas, proposed forest restoration strategies that could help in limiting the spread of zoonotic diseases. We identified a large gap in information on the effects of native vegetation restoration on zoonotic diseases, especially within tropical regions. In addition, the few studies that exist do not consider environmental aspects that can affect the outcomes of restoration on disease risk, such as the land use history and landscape structural characteristics (as composition and configuration of native habitats). Our conceptual framework raises two important points: (1) the effects of forest restoration may depend on the context of the existing landscape, especially the percentage of native vegetation existing at the beginning of the restoration; and (2) these effects will also be dependent on the spatial arrangement of the restored area within the existing landscape. Furthermore, we propose important topics to be studied in the coming years to integrate zoonotic disease risk as a criterion in restoration planning. Synthesis and application. Our results contribute to a more comprehensive forest restoration planning, comprising multiple ecosystem services and resulting in healthier landscapes for both people and nature. Our framework could be integrated into the post-2020 global biodiversity framework targets.

TI  - Forests and emerging infectious diseases: unleashing the beast within
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - Deforestation and associated changing landscapes are major components of environmental changes, with important implications for ecosystem functioning and biodiversity conservation. Tropical forests are hot spots of biodiversity and provide multiple goods and ecosystem services which benefitpeoplein many ways. Forests also play an important role in health-related legends, myths, and fairy tales from all over the world, and are important sources of new potential emerging microbial threats to humans. Although plausibly numerous abundant microbial forms with a forest origin may exist, our systematic literature review shows that forest-derived infection studies are relatively unexplored, and both taxonomically and geographically biased. Since biodiversity has been associated with emergence of novel infectious diseases at macro-scale, we describe the main biogeographical patterns in the emerging infection-biodiversity-forest loss nexus. Then, we illustrate four fine-scale case studies to decipher the underlying processes of increased infection risk in changing forest clearing landscapes. Finally, we identify scientific challenges and regional management measures required to mitigate these important new emerging threats.

TI  - Emerging threats linking tropical deforestation and the COVID-19 pandemic
T2  - PERSPECTIVES IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - Tropical deforestation drivers are complex and can change rapidly in periods of profound societal transformation, such as those during a pandemic. Evidence suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic has spurred illegal, opportunistic forest clearing in tropical countries, threatening forest ecosystems and their residenthuman communities. A total of 9583 km(2) of deforestation alerts from Global Land Analysis & Discovery (GLAD) were detected across the global tropics during the first month following the implementation of confinement measures of local governments to reduce COVID-19 spread, which is nearly double that of 2019 (4732 km(2)). We present a conceptual framework linking tropical deforestation and the current pandemic. Zoonotic diseases, public health, economy, agriculture, and forests may all be reciprocally linked in complex positive and negative feedback loops with overarching consequences. We highlight the emerging threats to nature and society resulting from this complex reciprocal interplay and possible policy interventions that could minimize these threats.

TI  - Outbreaks of Vector-Borne and Zoonotic Diseases Are Associated With Changes in Forest Cover and Oil Palm Expansion at Global Scale
T2  - FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE
AB  - Deforestation is a major cause of biodiversity loss with a negative impact on human health. This study explores at global scale whether the loss and gain of forest cover and the rise of oil palm plantations can promote outbreaks of vector-borne and zoonotic diseases. Taking into account the human population growth, we find that the increases in outbreaks of zoonotic and vector-borne diseases from 1990 to 2016 are linked with deforestation, mostly in tropical countries, and with reforestation, mostly in temperate countries. We also find that outbreaks of vector-borne diseases are associated with the increase in areas of palm oil plantations. Our study gives new support for a link between global deforestation and outbreaks of zoonotic and vector-borne diseases as well as evidences that reforestation and plantations may also contribute to epidemics of infectious diseases. The results are discussed in light of the importance of forests for biodiversity, livelihoods and human health and the need to urgently build an international governance framework to ensure the preservation of forests and the ecosystem services they provide, including the regulation of diseases. We develop recommendations to scientists, public health officers and policymakers who should reconcile the need to preserve biodiversity while taking into account the health risks posed by lack or mismanagement of forests.

TI  - Deforestation increases the abundance of rodents and their ectoparasites in the Lacandon forest, Southern Mexico
T2  - REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL
AB  - Introduction: Tropical forests provide important ecosystem services, including disease control. However, few studies have focused on how deforestation affects species more suitable to be zoonotic vectors. Objective: To evaluate how deforestation affects the abundance and species richness of rodents and their associ-ated ectoparasites in a tropical ecosystem.Methods: We captured rodents in 6 landscape units, 1 km2 each, with 0.7; 5; 40; 46; 78 and 95 % tree cover, in Marques de Comillas, Chiapas, Southern Mexico. In each unit we set 90 Sherman traps that were active 24 hours for 7 days during two sampling seasons (October 2019, and September 2020). We manually extracted ectoparasites from all captured rodents.Results: We captured 70 rodents of five species: Sigmodon toltecus, Heteromys desmarestianus, Ototylomys phyllotis, Peromyscus mexicanus, and Oryzomys couesi. Rodent abundance increased with forest loss (R2= 0.706, P= 0.022). The greatest richness of rodent species occurred in sites with intermediate forest cover (40 and 78 %). The most abundant species were: S. toltecus (N= 45) followed by O. couesi (N= 9), these species dominated in sites with less forest cover. We recorded a total of 23 ectoparasite species, three of them known to be zoonotic vectors: Amblyomma sp., Ornithonyssus bacoti, and Androlaelaps fahrenholzi.Conclusions: The ongoing loss of forests promotes the proliferation of zoonotic disease vectors in this tropical ecosystem, which can potentially increase the frequency of affectation among the local population.

TI  - Moving to healthier landscapes: Forest restoration decreases the abundance of Hantavirus reservoir rodents in tropical forests
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Hantavirus Cardiopulmonary Syndrome (HCPS) is a disease with high human lethality rates, whose transmission risk is directly related to the abundance of reservoir rodents. In the Brazilian Atlantic forest, the main reservoirs species, Oligoryzomys nigripes and Necromys lasiurus, are thought to increase in abundance with deforestation. Therefore, forest restoration may contribute to decrease HCPS transmission risk, a topic still unexplored, especially in tropical regions. Aiming at filling this research gap, we quantified the potential of forest restoration, as required by the current environmental legislation, to reduce the abundance of Hantavirus reservoir rodents in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Using a dataset on small mammal communities sampled at 104 sites, we modeled how the abundance of these two rodent species change with the percentage of forest cover and forest edge density. From the best model, we extrapolated rodent abundance to the entire Atlantic Forest, considering two scenarios: current and restored forest cover. Comparing the estimated abundance between these two scenarios, we show that forest restoration can reduce the abundance of O. nigripes up to 89.29% in 43.43% of Atlantic forest territory. For N. lasiurus, abundance decreased up to 46% in 44% of the Atlantic forest. To our knowledge, this is the first study linking forest restoration and zoonotic diseases. Our results indicate that forest restoration would decrease the chance of HCPS transmission in similar to 45% of the Atlantic forest, making the landscape healthier to similar to 2,8 million people livingwithin this area. This positive effect of restoration on disease regulation should be considered as an additional argument to encourage and promote forest restoration in tropical areas around the world.

TI  - Assessing deforestation and fragmentation in a tropical moist forest over 68 years; the impact of roads and legal protection in the Cockpit Country, Jamaica
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Historical data on landuse changes are important for interpreting the current status of natural systems such as forests. Analyses of road network dynamics can be particularly useful as network expansion is often a precursor to and an indicator of increased human activity. Legal protection is often seen as the most viable option available for protecting natural forests; but over the past decade, its effectiveness has been questioned. We assessed the impact of roads and the designation of a forest reserve on deforestation and forest fragmentation in a tropical moist forest, Cockpit Country, Jamaica, from 1942 to 2010. Specifically, we classified multi-temporal images (black and white aerial photographs, IKONOS and Geo-Eye images) using an object based image analysis and we included a vector of digitized roads for each year of assessment during the classification process. We then conducted a fragmentation analysis of the classified images and assessed the relationship between road density and several fragmentation metrics over time, and the spatial influence of the reserves (presence/absence) and roads (Euclidean distance from roads) on deforestation and several fragmentation metrics using generalized linear models.
   Between 1942 and 2010, road density nearly doubled (from 0.67 km/km(2) to 1.22 km/km2), with significant increases occurring within forest reserves, and was significantly related to the area-weighted mean shape index of the forest (forest patches became more regularly shaped and linear). Initially, relatively high deforestation rates and high levels of fragmentation between 1942 and 1961 were likely related to the large increase in road density. Deforestation and forest fragmentation were more likely to occur closer to roads over all time periods, and the magnitude/significance of this relationship peaked in subsequent time periods after road density doubled; but in the final time period, its influence declined. Legal protection afforded to the forest in the 1950s and 1960s coincided with an increase in total and core forest area and a reduction in deforestation rate, and deforestation and forest fragmentation were significantly lower inside the reserve. Therefore, the Forest Reserves were initially effective; however, their effectiveness waned after 1980. Increased deforestation and fragmentation in the 1980s and the 2000s indicate a more complex pattern of human encroachment, as these changes do not appear to have been influenced by changes to the road network, or by the presence of the Forest Reserves. Further research into the factors influencing human use of these forested areas is needed for effective management of the area. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Deforestation and avian infectious diseases
T2  - JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY
AB  - In this time of unprecedented global change, infectious diseases will impact humans and wildlife in novel and unknown ways. Climate change, the introduction of invasive species, urbanization, agricultural practices and the loss of biodiversity have all been implicated in increasing the spread of infectious pathogens. In many regards, deforestation supersedes these other global events in terms of its immediate potential global effects in both tropical and temperate regions. The effects of deforestation on the spread of pathogens in birds are largely unknown. Birds harbor many of the same types of pathogens as humans and in addition can spread infectious agents to humans and other wildlife. It is thought that avifauna have gone extinct due to infectious diseases and many are presently threatened, especially endemic island birds. It is clear that habitat degradation can pose a direct threat to many bird species but it is uncertain how these alterations will affect disease transmission and susceptibility to disease. The migration and dispersal of birds can also change with habitat degradation, and thus expose populations to novel pathogens. Some recent work has shown that the results of landscape transformation can have confounding effects on avian malaria, other haemosporidian parasites and viruses. Now with advances in many technologies, including mathematical and computer modeling, genomics and satellite tracking, scientists have tools to further research the disease ecology of deforestation. This research will be imperative to help predict and prevent outbreaks that could affect avifauna, humans and other wildlife worldwide.

TI  - The influence of forest definition on landscape fragmentation assessment in Rondonia, Brazil
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
AB  - Estimates of tropical deforestation and forest degradation are misleading, partly because different studies make use of different forest definitions. This paper investigates the influence of this confusion on the assessment of forest extent and its spatial distribution, by means of fine-scaled land cover maps and landscape metrics. The state of Rondonia, Brazil, located in the southwestern part of the Amazon basin and known for its fishbone-like pattern of deforestation, is used as a Study area. A 1:250 000 vector data product from the Brazilian Geography and Statistics Institute (IBGE), describing the land cover type in a three-step hierarchy specifying canopy density, topography, and dominant life forms, was rasterized and analyzed. Forest subcategories were aggregated into a seven level gradient, ranging from a level that is very specific and only includes dense multi-layered rain forest, to less strict levels containing open forest systems, secondary vegetation, and tree savannas. We show that there is a consistent difference between the initial class aggregation level, and all other levels, which gradually broaden the forest definition and are characterized by very distinct ecological parameters, such as a higher mean patch size, increased levels of landscape connectivity and slightly more irregularly shaped patches. We recommend a harmonization of the major forest definitions in use today, while taking care not to lose the relevant ecological information that can be extracted from its most detailed classification level.

TI  - Tropical forests, changes in land uses and emerging infectious hazards
T2  - SANTE PUBLIQUE
AB  - Tropical forests have the greatest biodiversity in macroorganisms on the planet, and they are also the richest in myriads of microorganisms for which so little is known today. Over the last 50 years, many of these microbial forms, that are naturally embedded into wildlife or the environment, e.g. soil, water, have revealed to be more or less dangerous pathogens for people exposed to these new natural threats, i.e. emerging infectious diseases. Here, we discuss about the extraordinary diversity of microorganisms that are present in tropical rainforests. We first present the main global distribution patterns for microbial forms at the interface between tropical wildlife and human, and second we provide an epidemiological picture on how microbial transmission from wild animals or the environment to people operates in tropical areas through four case-studies. We examine the animal hosts or environment, and transmission mechanisms involved in spillover of zoonotic or environmentally-persistent microbes, and identify land-use changes through deforestation for the development of agriculture, and contacts with wildlife notably through bush meat hunting as major drivers that facilitate mixing of diverse animal hosts and their microbial communities with human during practices. With an increase of deforestation in the tropics and more contacts between wildlife and people, new emerging disease events with high epidemic and pandemic potential will happen, that should guide new health policies and strategies at the global scale.

TI  - Habitat fragmentation, biodiversity loss and the risk of novel infectious disease emergence
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY INTERFACE
AB  - The number of microbes on Earth may be 10(30), exceeding all other diversity. A small number of these can infect people and cause disease. The diversity of parasitic organisms likely correlates with the hosts they live in and the number mammal hosts for zoonotic infections increases with species richness among mammalian orders. Thus, while habitat loss and fragmentation may reduce species diversity, the habitat encroachment by people into species-rich areas may increase the exposure of people to novel infectious agents from wildlife. Here, we present a theoretical framework that exploits the species-area relationship to link the exposure of people to novel infections with habitat biodiversity. We model changes in human exposure to microbes through defined classes of habitat fragmentation and predict that increased habitat division intrinsically increases the hazard from microbes for all modelled biological systems. We apply our model to African tropical forests as an example. Our results suggest that it is possible to identify high-risk areas for the mitigation and surveillance of novel disease emergence and that mitigation measures may reduce this risk while conserving biodiversity.

TI  - Landscape connectivity as a strategy to mitigate the risk of zoonoses from deforestation and defaunation
T2  - ECOSISTEMAS
AB  - Currently, human being activities have impaired ecosystem's resistance capacity to ecological disturbances at global scale. Human impact during the last century has caused an unprecedent rate of transformation of temperate and tropical forest at different scales, mainly due to deforestation. Humanity's exponential population growth rate and dramatic social inequity represent important challenges for achieving sustainability goals, given increased and uneven use of resources. In addition, land use change increases the population's risk to be affected by zoonotic emergent disease in tropical and temperate regions, which represents a public held issue. Therefore, landscape connectivity plays a key role not only in biodiversity conservation and maintenance of ecological functions, making the development of tools for land analysis and land use planning. This would allow the restoration of ecosystems, the creation of ecological corridors mainly for the protection of larger wildlife, as well as reducing the potential risk of zoonoses and the development of multidisciplinary studies.

TI  - Averting wildlife-borne infectious disease epidemics requires a focus on socio-ecological drivers and a redesign of the global food system
T2  - ECLINICALMEDICINE
AB  - A debate has emerged over the potential socio-ecological drivers of wildlife-origin zoonotic disease outbreaks and emerging infectious disease (EID) events. This Review explores the extent to which the incidence of wildlife-origin infectious disease outbreaks, which are likely to include devastating pandemics like HIV/AIDS and COVID-19, may be linked to excessive and increasing rates of tropical deforestation for agricultural food production and wild meat hunting and trade, which are further related to contemporary ecological crises such as global warming and mass species extinction. Here we explore a set of precautionary responses to wildlife-origin zoonosis threat, including: (a) limiting human encroachment into tropical wildlands by promoting a global transition to diets low in livestock source foods; (b) containing tropical wild meat hunting and trade by curbing urban wild meat demand, while securing access for indigenous people and local communities in remote subsistence areas; and (c) improving biosecurity and other strategies to break zoonosis transmission pathways at the wildlife-human interface and along animal source food supply chains.

TI  - The nexus between forest fragmentation in Africa and Ebola virus disease outbreaks
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Tropical forests are undergoing land use change in many regions of the world, including the African continent. Human populations living close to forest margins fragmented and disturbed by deforestation may be particularly exposed to zoonotic infections because of the higher likelihood for humans to be in contact with disease reservoirs. Quantitative analysis of the nexus between deforestation and the emergence of Ebola virus disease (EVD), however, is still missing. Here we use land cover change data in conjunction with EVD outbreak records to investigate the association between recent (2004-2014) outbreaks in West and Central Africa, and patterns of land use change in the region. We show how in these EVD outbreaks the index cases in humans (i.e. spillover from wildlife reservoirs) occurred mostly in hotspots of forest fragmentation.

TI  - The role of forest fragmentation in yellow fever virus dispersal
T2  - ACTA TROPICA
AB  - The intense process of deforestation in tropical forests poses serious challenges for the survival of biodiversity, as well as for the human species itself. This scenario is supported by the increase in the incidence of epidemics of zoonotic origin observed over the last few decades. In the specific case of sylvatic yellow fever (YF), it has already been shown that an increase in the transmission risk of the causative agent (yellow fever virus -YFV) is asso-ciated with areas with a high degree of forest fragmentation, which can facilitate the spread of the virus. In this study we tested the hypothesis that areas with more fragmented landscapes and a higher edge density (ED) but a high degree of connectivity between forest patches favor YFV spread. To this end, we used YF epizootics in non -human primates (NHPs) in the state of Sa & SIM;o Paulo to build direct networks, and used a multi-selection approach to analyze which landscape features could facilitate YFV spread. Our results showed that municipalities with the potential to spread the virus exhibited a higher amount of forest edge. Additionally, the models with greater empirical support showed a strong association between forest edge density and the risk of occurrence of epizootic diseases, as well as the need for a minimum threshold of native vegetation cover to restrict their transmission. These findings corroborate our hypothesis that more fragmented landscapes with a higher degree of connectivity favor the spread of YFV, while landscapes with fewer connections tend to act as dead zones for the circulation of the virus.

TI  - Human-Altered Landscapes and Climate to Predict Human Infectious Disease Hotspots
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE
AB  - Background: Zoonotic diseases account for more than 70% of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs). Due to their increasing incidence and impact on global health and the economy, the emergence of zoonoses is a major public health challenge. Here, we use a biogeographic approach to predict future hotspots and determine the factors influencing disease emergence. We have focused on the following three viral disease groups of concern: Filoviridae, Coronaviridae, and Henipaviruses. Methods: We modelled presence-absence data in spatially explicit binomial and zero-inflation binomial logistic regressions with and without autoregression. Presence data were extracted from published studies for the three EID groups. Various environmental and demographical rasters were used to explain the distribution of the EIDs. True Skill Statistic and deviance parameters were used to compare the accuracy of the different models. Results: For each group of viruses, we were able to identify and map areas at high risk of disease emergence based on the spatial distribution of the disease reservoirs and hosts of the three viral groups. Common influencing factors of disease emergence were climatic covariates (minimum temperature and rainfall) and human-induced land modifications. Conclusions: Using topographical, climatic, and previous disease outbreak reports, we can identify and predict future high-risk areas for disease emergence and their specific underlying human and environmental drivers. We suggest that such a predictive approach to EIDs should be carefully considered in the development of active surveillance systems for pathogen emergence and epidemics at local and global scales.

AB  - The Old World tropical and subtropical frugivorous bat genus Rousettus (Pteropodidae) contains species with broad distributions, as well as those occurring in restricted geographical areas, particularly islands. Herein we review the role of Rousettus as a keystone species from a global "One Health" approach and related to ecosystem functioning, zoonotic disease and public health. Rousettus are efficient at dispersing seeds and pollinating flowers; their role in forest regeneration is related to their ability to fly considerable distances during nightly foraging bouts and their relatively small body size, which allows them to access fruits in forested areas with closed vegetation. Rousettus are also reservoirs for various groups of pathogens (viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoa), which, by definition, are infectious agents causing disease. The study of day roosts of different species of Rousettus and the successful establishment of captive breeding colonies have provided important details related to the infection dynamics of their associated pathogens. Large-scale conversion of forested areas into agricultural landscapes has increased contact between humans and Rousettus, therefore augmenting the chances of infectious agent spillover. Many crucial scientific details are still lacking related to members of this genus, which have direct bearing on the prevention of emerging disease outbreaks, as well as the conservation of these bats. The public should be better informed on the capacity of fruit bats as keystone species for large scale forest regeneration and in spreading pathogens. Precise details on the transmission of zoonotic diseases of public health importance associated with Rousettus should be given high priority.

TI  - Foliar diseases in a seasonal tropical dry forest: Impacts of habitat fragmentation
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - The effects of forest fragmentation on fungal pathogens causing leaf damage to the shrub and tree community were investigated in a seasonal tropical dry forest. The study was carried out in 4 forest fragments, and 2 continuous forest sites located in the Chamela-Cuixmala Biosphere Reserve and surrounding areas (Jalisco, Mexico), along three years. Results showed that fungi were the pathogenic agents causing foliar damage in plants from both, fragments and continuous forest. Disease incidence was higher in 2004 due to a relatively high annual precipitation. The occurrence of leaf fungal pathogens was lower in fragments, than in continuous forest. Plant species diversity was significantly lower in fragments than in continuous forest, and was positively correlated to the number of diseased plant species, and to the proportion of diseased leaves and the leaf area damaged per plant. In addition, disease occurrence was negatively correlated with canopy openness. In conclusion, our results highlight the consequences of environmental changes associated to fragmentation on foliar fungal plant pathogens, a particular group of organisms that until recently has been mostly overlooked in tropical natural systems.

TI  - Tropical peatlands and their conservation are important in the context of COVID-19 and potential future (zoonotic) disease pandemics
T2  - PEERJ
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has caused global disruption, with the emergence of this and other pandemics having been linked to habitat encroachment and/or wildlife exploitation. High impacts of COVID-19 are apparent in some countries with large tropical peatland areas, some of which are relatively poorly resourced to tackle disease pandemics. Despite this, no previous investigation has considered tropical peatlands in the context of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs). Here, we review: (i) the potential for future EIDs arising from tropical peatlands; (ii) potential threats to tropical peatland conservation and local communities from COVID-19; and (iii) potential steps to help mitigate these risks. We find that high biodiversity in tropical peat-swamp forests, including presence of many potential vertebrate and invertebrate vectors, combined, in places, with high levels of habitat disruption and wildlife harvesting represent suitable conditions for potential zoonotic EID (re-) emergence. Although impossible to predict precisely, we identify numerous potential threats to tropical peatland conservation and local communities from the COVID-19 pandemic. This includes impacts on public health, with the potential for haze pollution from peatland fires to increase COVID-19 susceptibility a noted concern; and on local economies, livelihoods and food security, where impacts will likely be greater in remote communities with limited/no medical facilities that depend heavily on external trade. Research, training, education, conservation and restoration activities are also being affected, particularly those involving physical groupings and international travel, some of which may result in increased habitat encroachment, wildlife harvesting or fire, and may therefore precipitate longer-term negative impacts, including those relating to disease pandemics. We conclude that sustainable management of tropical peatlands and their wildlife is important for mitigating impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, and reducing the potential for future zoonotic EID emergence and severity, thus strengthening arguments for their conservation and restoration. To support this, we list seven specific recommendations relating to sustainable management of tropical peatlands in the context of COVID-19/disease pandemics, plus mitigating the current impacts of COVID-19 and reducing potential future zoonotic EID risk in these localities. Our discussion and many of the issues raised should also be relevant for non-tropical peatland areas and in relation to other (pandemic-related) sudden socio-economic shocks that may occur in future.

TI  - From Forest Landscape to Agricultural Landscape in the Developing Tropical Country of Malaysia: Pattern, Process, and Their Significance on Policy
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - Agricultural expansion and deforestation are spatial processes of land transformation that impact on landscape pattern. In peninsular Malaysia, the conversion of forested areas into two major cash crops-rubber and oil palm plantations-has been identified as driving significant environmental change. To date, there has been insufficient literature studying the link between changes in landscape patterns and land-related development policies. Therefore, this paper examines: (i) the links between development policies and changes in land use/land cover and landscape pattern and (ii) the significance and implications of these links for future development policies. The objective is to generate insights on the changing process of land use/land cover and landscape pattern as a functional response to development policies and their consequences for environmental conditions. Over the last century, the development of cash crops has changed the country from one dominated by natural landscapes to one dominated by agricultural landscapes. But the last decade of the century saw urbanization beginning to impact significantly. This process aligned with the establishment of various development policies, from land development for agriculture between the mid 1950s and the 1970s to an emphasis on manufacturing from the 1980s onward. Based on a case study in Selangor, peninsular Malaysia, a model of landscape pattern change is presented. It contains three stages according to the relative importance of rubber (first stage: 1900-1950s), oil palm (second stage: 1960s-1970s), and urban (third stage: 1980s-1990s) development that influenced landscape fragmentation and heterogeneity. The environmental consequences of this change have been depicted through loss of biodiversity, geohazard incidences, and the spread of vector-borne diseases. The spatial ecological information can be useful to development policy formulation, allowing diagnosis of the country's "health" and sustainability. The final section outlines the usefulness of landscape analysis in the policy-making process to prevent further fragmentation of the landscape and forest loss in Malaysia in the face of rapid economic development.

TI  - Forest disturbance and vector transmitted diseases in the lowland tropical rainforest of central Panama
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE & INTERNATIONAL HEALTH
AB  - Objective To explore possible changes in the community attributes of haematophagous insects as a function of forest disturbance. We compare the patterns of diversity and abundance, plus the behavioural responses of three epidemiologically distinct vector assemblages across sites depicting various levels of forest cover. Methods Over a 3-year period, we sampled mosquitoes, sandflies and biting-midges in forested habitats of central Panama. We placed CDC light traps in the forest canopy and in the understorey to gather blood-seeking females. Results We collected 168 405 adult haematophagous dipterans in total, including 26 genera and 86 species. Pristine forest settings were always more taxonomically diverse than the disturbed forest sites, confirming that disturbance has a negative impact on species richness. Species of Phlebotominae and Culicoides were mainly classified as climax (i.e. forest specialist) or disturbance-generalist, which tend to decrease in abundance along with rising levels of disturbance. In contrast, a significant portion of mosquito species, including primary and secondary disease vectors, was classified as colonists (i.e. disturbed-areas specialists), which tend to increase in numbers towards more disturbed forest habitats. At pristine forest, the most prevalent species of Phlebotominae and Culicoides partitioned the vertical niche by being active at the forest canopy or in the understorey; yet this pattern was less clear in disturbed habitats. Most mosquito species were not vertically stratified in their habitat preference. Conclusion We posit that entomological risk and related pathogen exposure to humans is higher in pristine forest scenarios for Culicoides and Phlebotominae transmitted diseases, whereas forest disturbance poses a higher entomological risk for mosquito-borne infections. This suggests that the Dilution Effect Hypothesis (DEH) does not apply in tropical rainforests where highly abundant, yet unrecognised insect vectors and neglected zoonotic diseases occur. Comprehensive, community level entomological surveillance is, therefore, the key for predicting potential disease spill over in scenarios of pristine forest intermixed with anthropogenic habitats. We suggest that changes in forest quality should also be considered when assessing arthropod-borne disease transmission risk.

TI  - Predicting disease risk areas through co-production of spatial models: The example of Kyasanur Forest Disease in India's forest landscapes
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Zoonotic diseases affect resource-poor tropical communities disproportionately, and are linked to human use and modification of ecosystems. Disentangling the socio-ecological mechanisms by which ecosystem change precipitates impacts of pathogens is critical for predicting disease risk and designing effective intervention strategies. Despite the global "One Health" initiative, predictive models for tropical zoonotic diseases often focus on narrow ranges of risk factors and are rarely scaled to intervention programs and ecosystem use. This study uses a participatory, co-production approach to address this disconnect between science, policy and implementation, by developing more informative disease models for a fatal tick-borne viral haemorrhagic disease, Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD), that is spreading across degraded forest ecosystems in India. We integrated knowledge across disciplines to identify key risk factors and needs with actors and beneficiaries across the relevant policy sectors, to understand disease patterns and develop decision support tools. Human case locations (2014-2018) and spatial machine learning quantified the relative role of risk factors, including forest cover and loss, host densities and public health access, in driving landscape-scale disease patterns in a long-affected district (Shivamogga, Karnataka State). Models combining forest metrics, livestock densities and elevation accurately predicted spatial patterns in human KFD cases (2014-2018). Consistent with suggestions that KFD is an "ecotonal" disease, landscapes at higher risk for human KFD contained diverse forest-plantation mosaics with high coverage of moist evergreen forest and plantation, high indigenous cattle density, and low coverage of dry deciduous forest. Models predicted new hotspots of outbreaks in 2019, indicating their value for spatial targeting of intervention. Co-production was vital for: gathering outbreak data that reflected locations of exposure in the landscape; better understanding contextual socio-ecological risk factors; and tailoring the spatial grain and outputs to the scale of forest use, and public health interventions. We argue this inter-disciplinary approach to risk prediction is applicable across zoonotic diseases in tropical settings.
   Author summary
   Worldwide, impacts of zoonotic diseases, that cycle between animals and people, are concentrated in tropical communities and often linked to the way people use and change ecosystems. Interventions for zoonotic diseases could be targeted better using risk maps based on computer models that integrate social and ecological risk factors across degraded ecosystems. However, such predictive models often perform poorly at local scales, incorporate narrow ranges of risk factors, and are disconnected from policy, managers and interventions. Co-production brings together stakeholders and knowledge, across the human health, animal health and environmental sectors, aligning with the OneHealth Initiative, to develop more informative predictive tools for zoonotic diseases. Through co-production, we develop predictive models for a fatal tick-borne disease, Kyasanur Forest Diseases (KFD) that is spreading across the degraded Western Ghats forest in India. These models incorporating contextual risk factors identified by stakeholders, accurately predicted patterns in human cases of KFD (2014-2018) in Shivamogga district, Karnataka State, and identified new hotspots of infection during the subsequent 2019 outbreak. Landscapes at highest risk encompassed diverse forest-plantation mosaics with high coverage of moist evergreen forest and plantation, high indigenous cattle density, and low coverage of dry deciduous forest. Co-production resulted in outbreak data that reflected where exposure occurred in the landscape and outputs of value for targeting of interventions, matched to the scale of forest use and public health interventions.

TI  - Biodiversity conservation in tropical forest landscapes of Oceania
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - The fragmented island realm of Oceania includes a relatively small proportion of the world's tropical forests, but those forests support unusual richness of narrowly endemic species. In common with tropical forests across most of the world, tropical forests in Oceania are declining due to factors associated with increasing human population size, economic drivers and more intensive exploitation. In parts of Oceania, forests are being cleared at unsustainable rates, and replaced with far simpler ecosystems of timber or food crops. To a small degree, the present-day biodiversity of tropical forests in some parts of Oceania may be predisposed to such disturbance, given a history of natural disturbance (particularly through cyclones), and of smaller-scale slash-and-burn agriculture or landscape-scale burning. But, in most places, the current intensity, scale and/or rate of modification far surpass their precedents, and biodiversity is consequently diminishing. Tropical forests in Australia may be an exception to this trend, with now reasonably effective protection. However, more so than for tropical forests in most other continents, the major biodiversity conservation challenges for tropical forests in Oceania are extrinsic. Introduced plants, animals and diseases have collapsed ecological communities through much of Oceania, homogenising the biota from a series of highly distinctive and localised species assemblages to a more impoverished set of ubiquitous disturbance-tolerant exotic species. In many islands, this simplification has occurred regardless of the extent of native forest remaining, such that retention and reservation of primary forest is an insufficient conservation action. The fate of biodiversity in Oceania is also likely to be much affected by climate change, an unbalanced consequence given the region's relatively small contribution to greenhouse gas emissions. Future hope for biodiversity conservation in tropical forests of Oceania lies in the renewed application of some traditional management constraints, the appropriate delivery of international support (such as may be available through carbon markets), improved quarantine processes, and through some protection naturally offered by the remote scattering of the islands that comprise Oceania.

TI  - Synthesizing the connections between environmental disturbances and zoonotic spillover
T2  - ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS
AB  - Zoonotic spillover is a phenomenon characterized by the transfer of pathogens between different animal species. Most human emerging infectious diseases originate from non-human animals, and human-related environmental disturbances are the driving forces of the emergence of new human pathogens. Synthesizing the sequence of basic events involved in the emergence of new human pathogens is important for guiding the understanding, identification, and description of key aspects of human activities that can be changed to prevent new outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemics. This review synthesizes the connections between environmental disturbances and increased risk of spillover events based on the One Health perspective. Anthropogenic disturbances in the environment (e.g., deforestation, habitat fragmentation, biodiversity loss, wildlife exploitation) lead to changes in ecological niches, reduction of the dilution effect, increased contact between humans and other animals, changes in the incidence and load of pathogens in animal populations, and alterations in the abiotic factors of landscapes. These phenomena can increase the risk of spillover events and, potentially, facilitate new infectious disease outbreaks. Using Brazil as a study model, this review brings a discussion concerning anthropogenic activities in the Amazon region and their potential impacts on spillover risk and spread of emerging diseases in this region.

TI  - Ecology, evolution, and epidemiology of zoonotic and vector-borne infectious diseases in French Guiana: Transdisciplinarity does matter to tackle new emerging threats
T2  - INFECTION GENETICS AND EVOLUTION
AB  - French Guiana is a European ultraperipheric region located on the northern Atlantic coast of South America. It constitutes an important forested region for biological conservation in the Neotropics. Although very sparsely populated, with its inhabitants mainly concentrated on the Atlantic coastal strip and along the two main rivers, it is marked by the presence and development of old and new epidemic disease outbreaks, both research and health priorities. In this review paper, we synthetize 15 years of multidisciplinary and integrative research at the interface between wildlife, ecosystem modification, human activities and sociodemographic development, and human health. This study reveals a complex epidemiological landscape marked by important transitional changes, facilitated by increased interconnections between wildlife, land-use change and human occupation and activity, human and trade transportation, demography with substantial immigration, and identified vector and parasite pharmacological resistance. Among other French Guianese characteristics, we demonstrate herein the existence of more complex multi-host disease life cycles than previously described for several disease systems in Central and South America, which clearly indicates that today the greater promiscuity between wildlife and humans due to demographic and economic pressures may offer novel settings for microbes and their hosts to circulate and spread. French Guiana is a microcosm that crystallizes all the current global environmental, demographic and socioeconomic change conditions, which may favor the development of ancient and future infectious diseases.

TI  - Deforestation-driven food-web collapse linked to emerging tropical infectious disease, <i>Mycobacterium ulcerans</i>
T2  - SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB  - Generalist microorganisms are the agents of many emerging infectious diseases (EIDs), but their natural life cycles are difficult to predict due to the multiplicity of potential hosts and environmental reservoirs. Among 250 known human EIDs, many have been traced to tropical rain forests and specifically freshwater aquatic systems, which act as an interface between microbe-rich sediments or substrates and terrestrial habitats. Along with the rapid urbanization of developing countries, population encroachment, deforestation, and land-use modifications are expected to increase the risk of EID outbreaks. We show that the freshwater food-web collapse driven by land-use change has a nonlinear effect on the abundance of preferential hosts of a generalist bacterial pathogen, Mycobacterium ulcerans. This leads to an increase of the pathogen within systems at certain levels of environmental disturbance. The complex link between aquatic, terrestrial, and EID processes highlights the potential importance of species community composition and structure and species life history traits in disease risk estimation and mapping. Mechanisms such as the one shown here are also central in predicting how human-induced environmental change, for example, deforestation and changes in land use, may drive emergence.

TI  - Global hotspots and correlates of emerging zoonotic diseases
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB  - Zoonoses originating from wildlife represent a significant threat to global health, security and economic growth, and combatting their emergence is a public health priority. However, our understanding of the mechanisms underlying their emergence remains rudimentary. Here we update a global database of emerging infectious disease (EID) events, create a novel measure of reporting effort, and fit boosted regression tree models to analyze the demographic, environmental and biological correlates of their occurrence. After accounting for reporting effort, we show that zoonotic EID risk is elevated in forested tropical regions experiencing land-use changes and where wildlife biodiversity (mammal species richness) is high. We present a new global hotspot map of spatial variation in our zoonotic EID risk index, and partial dependence plots illustrating relationships between events and predictors. Our results may help to improve surveillance and long-term EID monitoring programs, and design field experiments to test underlying mechanisms of zoonotic disease emergence.

TI  - Neglected tropical diseases risk correlates with poverty and early ecosystem destruction
T2  - INFECTIOUS DISEASES OF POVERTY
AB  - BackgroundNeglected tropical diseases affect the most vulnerable populations and cause chronic and debilitating disorders. Socioeconomic vulnerability is a well-known and important determinant of neglected tropical diseases. For example, poverty and sanitation could influence parasite transmission. Nevertheless, the quantitative impact of socioeconomic conditions on disease transmission risk remains poorly explored.MethodsThis study investigated the role of socioeconomic variables in the predictive capacity of risk models of neglected tropical zoonoses using a decade of epidemiological data (2007-2018) from Brazil. Vector-borne diseases investigated in this study included dengue, malaria, Chagas disease, leishmaniasis, and Brazilian spotted fever, while directly-transmitted zoonotic diseases included schistosomiasis, leptospirosis, and hantaviruses. Environmental and socioeconomic predictors were combined with infectious disease data to build environmental and socioenvironmental sets of ecological niche models and their performances were compared.ResultsSocioeconomic variables were found to be as important as environmental variables in influencing the estimated likelihood of disease transmission across large spatial scales. The combination of socioeconomic and environmental variables improved overall model accuracy (or predictive power) by 10% on average (P < 0.01), reaching a maximum of 18% in the case of dengue fever. Gross domestic product was the most important socioeconomic variable (37% relative variable importance, all individual models exhibited P < 0.00), showing a decreasing relationship with disease indicating poverty as a major factor for disease transmission. Loss of natural vegetation cover between 2008 and 2018 was the most important environmental variable (42% relative variable importance, P < 0.05) among environmental models, exhibiting a decreasing relationship with disease probability, showing that these diseases are especially prevalent in areas where natural ecosystem destruction is on its initial stages and lower when ecosystem destruction is on more advanced stages.ConclusionsDestruction of natural ecosystems coupled with low income explain macro-scale neglected tropical and zoonotic disease probability in Brazil. Addition of socioeconomic variables improves transmission risk forecasts on tandem with environmental variables. Our results highlight that to efficiently address neglected tropical diseases, public health strategies must target both reduction of poverty and cessation of destruction of natural forests and savannas.

TI  - Effects of forest loss and fragmentation on bat-ectoparasite interactions
T2  - PARASITOLOGY RESEARCH
AB  - Human land use causes habitat loss and fragmentation, influencing host-parasite associations through changes in infestation rates, host mortality and possibly local extinction. Bat-ectoparasite interactions are an important host-parasite model possibly affected by such changes, as this system acts as both reservoirs and vectors of several pathogens that can infect different wild and domestic species. This study aimed to assess how the prevalence and abundance of bat ectoparasites respond to forest loss, fragmentation, and edge length. Bats and ectoparasites were sampled at twenty sites, forming a gradient of forest cover, in southwestern Brazil during two wet (2015 and 2016) and two dry (2016 and 2017) seasons. Effects of landscape metrics on host abundance as well as parasite prevalence and abundance were assessed through structural equation models. Nine host-parasite associations provided sufficient data for analyses, including one tick and eight flies on four bat species. Forest cover positively influenced the prevalence or abundance of three fly species, but negatively influenced one fly and the tick species. Prevalence or abundance responded positively to edge length for three fly species, and negatively for the tick. In turn, number of fragments influenced the prevalence or abundance of four fly species, two positively and two negatively. Our results support species-specific responses of ectoparasites to landscape features, and a tendency of host-generalist ticks to benefit from deforestation while most host-specialist flies are disadvantaged. Differences in host traits and abundance, along with parasite life cycles and environmental conditions, are possible explanations to our findings.

TI  - Impact of Fire on Secondary Forest Succession in a Sub-Tropical Landscape
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - In Hong Kong, as in many tropical areas, grasslands are maintained by fire on disturbed and abandoned land. However, Hong Kong's native forests are regenerating in many areas, alongside frequent burning of the hillsides, and are in different stages of structural succession to closed canopy forest patches. Understanding the major determinants of secondary succession is a vital input to forest management policies. Given the importance of forests for biodiversity conservation, watershed protection and carbon cycling. This study examines the relationship between burning regimes and structural forest succession over 42 years from 1973 to 2015, using an archive of satellite images, aerial photographs and field plot data. Overlay of a fire frequency map with maps of forest structural classes at different dates indicates the number of fires undergone by each successional class as well as the time taken to progress from one class to another under different fire regimes. Results indicate that the native sub-tropical evergreen forests, which are naturally fire intolerant, can regenerate alongside moderate burning, and once the shrub stage is reached, succession to closed forest is relatively rapid and can occur within 13 years. More than one burn, however, is more destructive, and twice-burnt areas were seen to have only one-third of the woody biomass of once-burnt plots. The most frequent fires occurred in areas where mono-cultural plantations had been destroyed by disease in the 1960s and were subsequently invaded by grasslands. These former plantation areas remained in early successional stages of grass and open shrubland by 2015. Other plantations from the 1970s and 1980s remain as plantations today and have acted as a barrier to natural forest succession, attesting to the greater effectiveness of fire control over re-afforestation measures.

TI  - Natural-Product-Based Solutions for Tropical Infectious Diseases
T2  - CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY REVIEWS
AB  - About half of the world's population and 80% of the world's biodiversity can be found in the tropics. Many diseases are specific to the tropics, with at least 41 diseases caused by endemic bacteria, viruses, parasites, and fungi. Such diseases are of increasing concern, as the geographic range of tropical diseases is expanding due to climate change, urbanization, change in agricultural practices, deforestation, and loss of biodiversity. While traditional medicines have been used for centuries in the treatment of tropical diseases, the active natural compounds within these medicines remain largely unknown. In this review, we describe infectious diseases specific to the tropics, including their causative pathogens, modes of transmission, recent major outbreaks, and geographic locations. We further review current treatments for these tropical diseases, carefully consider the biodiscovery potential of the tropical biome, and discuss a range of technologies being used for drug development from natural resources. We provide a list of natural products with antimicrobial activity, detailing the source organisms and their effectiveness as treatment. We discuss how technological advancements, such as next-generation sequencing, are driving high-throughput natural product screening pipelines to identify compounds with therapeutic properties. This review demonstrates the impact natural products from the vast tropical biome have in the treatment of tropical infectious diseases and how high throughput technical capacity will accelerate this discovery process.

TI  - Habitat fragmentation matters more than habitat loss: The case of host-parasite interactions
T2  - MOLECULAR ECOLOGY
AB  - While ecologists agree that habitat loss has a substantial negative effect on biodiversity it is still very much a matter of debate whether habitat fragmentation has a lesser effect and whether this effect is positive or negative for biodiversity. Here, we assess the relative influence of tropical forest loss and fragmentation on the prevalence of vector-borne blood parasites of the genera Plasmodium and Haemoproteus in six forest bird species. We also determine whether habitat loss and fragmentation are associated with a rise or fall in prevalence. We sample more than 4000 individual birds from 58 forest sites in Guadeloupe and Martinique. Considering 34 host-parasite combinations independently and a fine characterization of the amount and spatial configuration of habitat, we use partial least square regressions to disentangle the relative effects of forest loss, forest fragmentation, landscape heterogeneity, and local weather conditions on spatial variability of parasite prevalence. Then we test for the magnitude and the sign of the effect of each environmental descriptor. Strikingly, we show that forest fragmentation explains twice as much of the variance in prevalence as habitat loss or landscape heterogeneity. In addition, habitat fragmentation leads to an overall rise in prevalence in Guadeloupe, but its effect is variable in Martinique. Both habitat loss and landscape heterogeneity exhibit taxon-specific effects. Our results suggest that habitat loss and fragmentation may have contrasting effects between tropical and temperate regions and that inter-specific interactions may not respond in the same way as more commonly used biodiversity metrics such as abundance and diversity.

TI  - Higher forest cover and less contrasting matrices improve carrion removal service by scavenger insects in tropical landscapes
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - Understanding the links between biological communities and ecosystem service provision through the mechanisms driven by landscape structure is crucial to promote management strategies that safeguard both biodiversity and provision of these services. Here, we assess the impact of landscape structure and matrix contrast on carrion removal by scavenger insects, an often overlooked ecosystem service but of paramount importance for nutrient cycling and disease control. We first hypothesize that more forested landscapes and less contrasting matrices harbour richer communities of scavenger insects, mainly composed of forest species. We then posit that these richer communities of scavenger insects promote a higher provision of the carrion removal service. The scavenger insect community and carrion removal service was surveyed using 18 independent paired sampling sites (forest-agricultural matrix, composed either by coffee plantations or cattle pastures) in the Atlantic Brazilian Forest domain. We measured insect species richness, community composition and carrion removal amount using meat baits inside exclusion cages monitored along 6 days across a forest cover gradient (8%-89%) and distance gradient from forest edge (0-100 m to the interior of forest patches and adjacent matrix). Species richness of scavenger insects was higher in more fragmented landscapes, with more forested areas presenting communities composed of mainly forest-associated species. Carrion in coffee plantations attracted richer communities than in cattle pastures or forests. Coffee plantations also presented communities with more forest-associated species than cattle pastures. Carrion removal was higher in both forest and coffee plantations compared to cattle pastures. Even though forest communities had lower species richness, key forest-associated groups were the bulk of a higher service provision. Synthesis and applications. Forested landscapes with less contrasting matrices maintain a higher provision of carrion removal service by sustaining communities composed of scavenger insects with higher carrion removal capacity-mostly forest-associated species. Landscape management focusing on the conservation and reforestation of native forest patches, as well as reducing matrix contrast, could facilitate species spillover and thereby ensure the provision of carrion removal service.

TI  - Effects of Forest Fragmentation on the Volume of Wood Resources in Managed, Pine-Dominated Forests in Poland
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Forest fragmentation is a widespread phenomenon that directly or indirectly affects the processes that take place both in forest ecosystems and in their immediate surroundings. So far, many studies confirm its negative effects, especially on biodiversity. On the other hand, there are few studies that address the effects of forest fragmentation on the amount of accumulated biomass or carbon, as well as on the characteristics of wood resources in managed forests. Therefore, issues related to timber production, which are important from the point of view of multifunctional forest management, are omitted. The aim of our research was to add to the knowledge in this area. In particular, we focused on assessing the impact of forest fragmentation on wood resources based on an analysis of edge effects in forest patches (units formed by combining forest fragments characterized by structural connectivity). Vector data describing the topography of forest fragments in Poland and the results of the National Forest Inventory (NFI) from 2015-2019 were used as material for solving this problem. The results of our research showed that the effects of fragmentation on managed pine stands depend on the age of the stand and the fertility of the habitat. In young stands growing on barren or strongly barren habitats, growing stock volume turned out to be significantly higher in the edge zone. In older stands, especially on moderately fertile habitats, significantly higher resources were found in the interior zone of forest patches. Habitat quality also had a significant effect on the amount of carbon accumulated. In strongly barren habitats, higher carbon mass was found in edge zones, while in moderately fertile habitats, stands had higher carbon volume in the interior zone. Our results illustrate that forest fragmentation is a very complex process that can increase or reduce wood resources, depending on the age of the stand and the quality of the habitat. From the standpoint of measurable benefits, it was concluded that protection from the negative effects of fragmentation should focus primarily on older stands and more fertile habitats.

TI  - Long-Tailed Macaque Response to Deforestation in a <i>Plasmodium knowlesi</i>-Endemic Area
T2  - ECOHEALTH
AB  - Land-use changes can impact infectious disease transmission by increasing spatial overlap between people and wildlife disease reservoirs. In Malaysian Borneo, increases in human infections by the zoonotic malaria Plasmodium knowlesi are hypothesised to be due to increasing contact between people and macaques due to deforestation. To explore how macaque responses to environmental change impact disease risks, we analysed movement of a GPS-collared long-tailed macaque in a knowlesi-endemic area in Sabah, Malaysia, during a deforestation event. Land-cover maps were derived from satellite-based and aerial remote sensing data and models of macaque occurrence were developed to evaluate how macaque habitat use was influenced by land-use change. During deforestation, changes were observed in macaque troop home range size, movement speeds and use of different habitat types. Results of models were consistent with the hypothesis that macaque ranging behaviour is disturbed by deforestation events but begins to equilibrate after seeking and occupying a new habitat, potentially impacting human disease risks. Further research is required to explore how these changes in macaque movement affect knowlesi epidemiology on a wider spatial scale.

TI  - Quantifying deforestation in a permanent forest reserve using vectorised Landsat TM
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL FOREST SCIENCE
AB  - Vectorising Landsat TM image (127/56 path/row) was carried out in this study to quantify deforestation using integration of remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) in Permanent Forest Reserve (PFR) of northern Kelantan, Malaysia (latitudes 04degrees 30' N to 06degrees 15' N and longitudes 101degrees 20' E to 102degrees 40' E). The PFR boundary map in 1989 was digitised to analyse physical factors that affect deforestation. By using minimum distance supervised classification, Landsat TM is an effective tool for distinguishing forested area from non-forested area such as rubber, oil palm and paddy with overall accuracy of about 84.8% and mean accuracy of between 58.3 and 97.7%. The rate of deforestation was about 2.3% per year with 73 236 ha of the PFR in the northern part of Kelantan being converted into non-forested purposes within eight years (1989-1997). The change from forest into mixed crop or rubber within eight years was estimated to be 19 252.1 ha. However, 53 984.1 ha of forest were converted into shrubs, while approximately 1178.5 ha of forest were converted into grassland/open areas. This study implies that RS/GIS technique is a useful tool in quantifying deforestation in PFR.

TI  - Climate determines transmission hotspots of Polycystic Echinococcosis, a life- threatening zoonotic disease, across Pan-Amazonia
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
AB  - Polycystic Echinococcosis (PE), a neglected life-threatening zoonotic disease caused by the cestode Echinococcus vogeli, is endemic in the Amazon. Despite being treatable, PE reaches a case fatality rate of around 29% due to late or missed diagnosis. PE is sustained in Pan-Amazonia by a complex sylvatic cycle. The hunting of its infected intermediate hosts (especially the lowland paca Cuniculus paca) enables the disease to further transmit to humans, when their viscera are improperly handled. In this study, we compiled a unique dataset of host occurrences (similar to 86000 records) and disease infections (similar to 400 cases) covering the entire Pan-Amazonia and employed different modeling and statistical tools to unveil the spatial distribution of PE's key animal hosts. Subsequently, we derived a set of ecological, environmental, climatic, and hunting covariates that potentially act as transmission risk factors and used them as predictors of two independent Maximum Entropy models, one for animal infections and one for human infections. Our findings indicate that temperature stability promotes the sylvatic circulation of the disease. Additionally, we show how El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) extreme events disrupt hunting patterns throughout Pan-Amazonia, ultimately affecting the probability of spillover. In a scenario where climate extremes are projected to intensify, climate change at regional level appears to be indirectly driving the spillover of E. vogeli. These results hold substantial implications for a wide range of zoonoses acquired at the wildlife-human interface for which transmission is related to the manipulation and consumption of wild meat, underscoring the pressing need for enhanced awareness and intervention strategies.
   Significance
   The impact of climate on neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) has been extensively discussed, but there is a lack of mechanistic evidence establishing a direct link. In this paper, we compiled a unique dataset to investigate the factors driving the spillover dynamics of Polycystic Equinococosis (PE), a neglected zoonotic disease with high case fatality rates, in Pan-Amazonia. PE spillover occurs through complex wildlife-human interactions facilitated by hunting and wild meat manipulation. Our study demonstrates that temperature stability promotes the sylvatic circulation of PE, while El Nino-Southern Oscillation extreme events disrupt hunting patterns, thereby affecting the risk of PE spillover to humans. These findings provide evidence attributing the effects of climate to NTDs in Pan-Amazonia, with implications for similar hunting-related zoonoses.

TI  - The prevalence of avian <i>Plasmodium</i> is higher in undisturbed tropical forests of Cameroon
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY
AB  - Habitat fragmentation and deforestation are thought to disrupt host-parasite interactions and increase the risk of epizootic outbreaks in wild vertebrates. A total of 220 individuals from three species of African rain-forest bird (Andropadus latirostris, Andropadus virens, Cyanomitra obscura), captured in two pristine and two agroforests in Cameroon. were screened for the presence of avian haemosporidian parasites (species of Plasmodium and Haemwoproteus) to test whether habitat differences were associated with differences in the prevalence of infectious diseases in natural populations. Thirteen mitochondrial lineages, including 11 Plasmodium and two Haemoproteus lineages were identified. Whereas levels of Haemoproteus spp. infections were too low to permit analysis, the prevalence of infections with Plasmodium spp. reached significantly greater levels in undisturbed mature forests. Importantly however, the significant association between forest type and parasite prevalence was independent of host density effects, suggesting that the association did not reflect changes in host species composition and abundance between forest types. Our results illustrate how characterizing land-cover differences, and hence changes, may be a prerequisite to understanding and predicting patterns of parasite infections in natural populations of rain-forest birds.

TI  - Effects of habitat fragmentation on pollen flow and genetic diversity of the endangered tropical tree <i>Swietenia humilis</i> (Meliaceae)
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Fragmentation of tropical forest represents a major threat to some tree populations by reducing local population size and gene flow from other populations. Both processes can decrease outcrossing rates and genetic variation in remnant stands. Despite these risks, some tree species have pollen vectors that mitigate these negative consequences for fragmented populations. In this paper, we assess both pollen flow and diversity of pollen sources in continuous forest and isolated stands of Swietenia humilis, a tropical tree species pollinated by small insects. Using seven nuclear microsatellite markers, we test the hypothesis that genetic diversity and the number of pollen donors are lower in remnant populations. Results show that allelic richness of seeds is lower in isolated populations (6.1 vs. 8.3 alleles per locus), even though adult populations do not show this difference.
   Pollen pool structure is greater in isolated patches (Phi(Iso) = 0.26) than in continuous forest (Phi(For) = 0.14), which yields estimates of the average effective number of pollen donors (N-ep) of 1.9 and 3.6 respectively. In addition, estimates of number of sires per mother indicate that isolated trees have half the number of pollen sources (4.98) than trees in the forest (9.8). Although extensive pollen movement (>2000 m) was recorded on both habitat conditions, indicating that fragmented patches are not isolated from pollen-mediated gene flow, this extensive pollen flow among trees in fragmented landscapes may not serve to counteract deleterious reproductive and genetic consequences of habitat fragmentation.

TI  - Assessing the distribution of disease-bearing rodents in human-modified tropical landscapes
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - We tested how habitat structure and fragmentation affect the spatial distribution of common murine rodents inhabiting human-dominated landscapes in South-East Asia. The spatial distribution patterns observed for each rodent species were then used to assess how changes in habitat structure may potentially affect the risk of several major rodent-borne diseases. For this analysis, we used an extensive geo-referenced data base containing details of rodents trapped from seven sites in Thailand, Cambodia and Lao PDR. We also developed land-cover layers for each site. Results from published studies that screened for five major rodent-borne pathogens in rodents were used to estimate how these pathogens would likely be impacted by these alterations in habitat structure and composition. Our results confirmed the specialist and/or synanthropic status of several rodent species, although the majority of species studied demonstrated some degree of low level of habitat specialization. Habitat diversity and its alteration (decreasing forest cover, increasing fragmentation, increasing urbanization) were found to favour the presence of synanthropic rodent species such as Rattus tanezumi, known to damage crops and host important rodent-borne diseases.Synthesis and applications. The five major rodent-borne pathogens were linked to ongoing changes in habitat structure. In particular, the presence of Bartonella spp. and hantaviruses seemed to be favoured in wooded landscapes affected by ongoing fragmentation and human encroachments. Rodents also pose significant problems for crop production in South-East Asia. Our results showed that the structure of the landscape affects the likely presence of rodent species considered as agricultural pests. The patchy structure of a landscape can either enhance, such as B.indica, or decrease, such as B.savilei, the presence of rodents that may cause serious damage to crops.

TI  - Deforestation and cattle ranching drive rapid range expansion of capybara in the Gran Chaco ecosystem
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - Anthropogenic habitat alteration has the capacity to alter the distribution of species. Capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) are a widely distributed rodent throughout most of South America, but are restricted to areas of standing water. As the Gran Chaco ecosystem of Paraguay is converted from dry tropical forest to pastureland, we hypothesize that this alteration creates potential for invasion by capybara into newly fragmented areas. We surveyed throughout the Chaco to estimate the distribution of capybara, and we collected noninvasive genetic samples. We used ecological niche modeling based on six environmental or climatic variables, and we modeled both the current distribution of capybara and the distribution of capybara 80 years ago. We then verified the hypothesized demographic signal generated with our model using phylogeographic analyses of 386 bp of the mtDNA control region. Comparison of present and past models suggested that populations expanded into the Gran Chaco after forest was converted to pastureland. Analyses of the mitochondrial D-loop supported the rapid range expansion scenario. We also found evidence of secondary contact of two distinct phylogroups which had previously been disjunct. Anthropogenic land transformation appeared to be a major factor influencing the distribution, as predicted by the niche model and confirmed by genetic data. Habitat modification altered connectivity of populations across the landscape. In addition, long separated clades of capybara are now admixed throughout the Paraguayan Chaco. The invasion of a large bodied herbivore into the High Chaco region may exacerbate the degradation of forest and prevent forest regeneration. As the reservoir host of several zoonotic diseases, the expansion and contact of two previously disjunct capybara populations has implications for disease emergence.

TI  - Bushmeat, human impacts and human health in tropical rainforests: the Ebola virus case
T2  - SANTE PUBLIQUE
AB  - At a time when more than 5 million tonnes of bushmeat are harvested annually from tropical forests, and which account for a significant, but unrecorded, share of the gross domestic product of many forest countries, decision makers are encouraged, within conservation and food security policies, to understand the role that wildlife can play in the conservation of ecosystem services. In this article, we present an analysis of the problem, describing the role played by bushmeat in human diets, and the health risks linked to the consumption of bushmeat, in particular with regard to Ebola disease, to provide insights on the direction of possible strategies to manage the use of wildlife for meeting the needs of local populations and reducing risks to human health.

TI  - Deforestation alters phytotelm habitat availability and mosquito production in the Peruvian Amazon
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
AB  - We quantified the effects of deforestation, and subsequent cultivation and forest regeneration, on the abundance and composition of mosquito larval habitats, specifically phytotelmata (plant-held waters), in the western Amazon basin. Recently deforested sites were characterized by increased phytotelm density (1.6 phytotelmata/m(2)) and greater relative abundance of fallen-plant-part phytotelmata (76%) compared to intact forests (0.9 phytotelmata/m(2) and 25% fallen plant parts). As a result, the total volume of colonizable phytotelm water was significantly larger in new clearings. Subsequent cultivation of cleared land with mixed crops including pineapple and plantain had similar consequences: phytotelm density (2.2 units/m(2)) was significantly larger in plantations than in forests due to greater relative abundance of water-filled plant axils (71% vs. 39% in forest). Such axils are the preferred larval habitats for Wyeomyia slip. mosquitoes, which showed a similarly significant increase in production in plantations (0.25 larvae/m(2)) vs. forests (0.04 larvae/m(2)). Likewise, Litnatus slip. mosquitoes were an order of magnitude more abundant in altered landscapes (especially in recently deforested and cultivated areas) than in mature forest, due to increased abundance of fallen-plant-part phytotelmata, in which they are typically the most common colonists. Because they are potential vectors of pathogens in a region of high endemic and emergent virus activity, increases in local abundance of Limatus spp. and Wyeomyia spp. due to large-scale deforestation and agriculture may influence rates of disease transmission.

TI  - Forest Resources Assessment of 2015 shows positive global trends but forest loss and degradation persist in poor tropical countries
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - The Global Forest Resources Assessment 2015 shows that deforestation has slowed and afforestation has increased globally during 1990-2015. Planted forests have increasingly provided goods and services hitherto derived from natural forests, and mosaic forests in agricultural landscapes are increasing. Forest gain is occurring at higher latitudes and in richer countries whilst forest loss continues in poor countries in the tropics. Some middle income tropical countries are now also transitioning to forest gain. These transition countries are characterised by reforms to forest management and improvements in agricultural practices but also by significant expansions of planted forest, which account for similar to 25-100% of gains. Forest-area estimates of the FRA align with satellite-derived estimates, with deviations of <=+/- 7% globally and <=+/- 17% for the tropics. Mosaics comprised of trees outside forests, remnant forest patches, and young regenerating forests constitute a modest proportion of the tropical forest estate and are seemingly well inventoried by the FRA. Extensive areas of forest experienced partial canopy cover reduction since 2000, particularly in the tropics where their area is similar to 6.5 times that deforested since 1990. The likelihood of the eventual loss of these forests and a decline in their capacity to provide goods and services is a matter of concern. Demand for industrial wood and fuelwood increased 35% in the tropics since 1990, principally in poorer countries, and growth in demand will accelerate into the future, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. Notwithstanding significant increases in forests within protected areas since 1990 to 517 Mha (16.3%) globally and 379 Mha (26.6%) in the tropics, increasing demands for ecological services, forest products, and climate change mitigation is likely to be met from an expanding area of planted forests more than from the declining area of natural forests, particularly in Africa. The global rate of planted-forest expansion since 1990 is close to a target rate of 2.4% per annum necessary to replace wood supplied from natural forests in the medium term, though the expansion rate has declined to 1.5% since 2005. Multiple-use forests permitting both production and conservation account for 26% of the global forest area and 17% of the tropical forest area, and have increased by 81.8 Mha or 8.5% globally since 1990, with most gains in the tropics. Sustainable forest management in low-income and tropical countries remains modest, with only 37% low-income country forests covered by forest inventories. International support has proven effective at increasing this coverage since 2010. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V. This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license.

TI  - The national determinants of deforestation in sub-Saharan Africa
T2  - PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB  - For decades, the dynamics of tropical deforestation in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) have defied easy explanation. The rates of deforestation have been lower than elsewhere in the tropics, and the driving forces evident in other places, government new land settlement schemes and industrialized agriculture, have largely been absent in SSA. The context and causes for African deforestation become clearer through an analysis of new, national-level data on forest cover change for SSA countries for the 2000-2005 period. The recent dynamic in SSA varies from dry to wet biomes. Deforestation occurred at faster rates in nations with predominantly dry forests. The wetter Congo basin countries had lower rates of deforestation, in part because tax receipts from oil and mineral industries in this region spurred rural to urban migration, declines in agriculture and increased imports of cereals from abroad. In this respect, the Congo basin countries may be experiencing an oil and mineral fuelled forest transition. Small farmers play a more important role in African deforestation than they do in southeast Asia and Latin America, in part because small-scale agriculture remains one of the few livelihoods open to rural peoples.

TI  - FUNGAL COMMUNITIES IN WET TROPICAL FORESTS - VARIATION IN TIME AND SPACE
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE BOTANIQUE
AB  - Understanding variation in tropical forest fungal populations and communities is important for assessing fungal biodiversity, as well as for understanding the regulatory roles fungi play in tropical forests. In wet tropical forests, the canopy is typically occupied by certain wood decomposers, endophytes, epiphylls, and pathogens. Aphyllophoraceous canopy fungi are a subset of species found in the understory. Marasmioid agarics in the understory often form extensive networks of rhizomorphs that trap litter; these and other aerial species are rare on the forest floor. Decomposers are stratified within the forest floor, with some species colonizing only fresh litter, others preferring decomposed litter, and others restricted to soil organic matter. Specificity to particular host substrates is frequent among tropical forest litter decomposers and contributes to spatial heterogeneity in fungal communities over the landscape. Litter basidiomycete and microfungal communities in patches of 1 m(2) or less do not significantly resemble communities in similar patches located at distances greater than LOO m. Disturbances induce changes in the environment and the abundance of different substrates, resulting in changes in fungal communities through time, and variation over the landscape. Severe disturbances, as well as the slight daily variations in rainfall, profoundly affect populations of fungal decomposers and their influence on plant nutrient availability.

TI  - Domain-Adversarial Neural Networks for Deforestation Detection in Tropical Forests
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
AB  - Many deep-learning (DL)-based, domain adaptation (DA) methods for remote sensing (RS) applications rely on adversarial training strategies to align features extracted from images of different domains in a shared latent space. However, the performance of such representation matching techniques is negatively impacted when class occurrences in the target domain, for which no labeled data are available during training, are highly imbalanced. In this work, we propose a DL-based representation matching approach for DA in the context of change detection tasks. We further evaluate the approach in a deforestation mapping application, characterized by a high-class imbalance between the deforestation and no-deforestation classes. The domains represent different sites in the Amazon and Brazilian Cerrado biomes. To mitigate the class imbalance problem, we devised an unsupervised pseudolabeling scheme based on change vector analysis (CVA) that prevents the feature alignment to be biased toward the overrepresented class. The experimental results indicate that the proposed approach can improve the accuracy of cross-domain deforestation detection.

TI  - Proposed Integrated Control of Zoonotic <i>Plasmodium knowlesi</i> in Southeast Asia Using Themes of One Health
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE
AB  - Zoonotic malaria, Plasmodium knowlesi, threatens the global progression of malaria elimination. Southeast Asian regions are fronting increased zoonotic malaria rates despite the control measures currently implemented-conventional measures to control human-malaria neglect P. knowlesi's residual transmission between the natural macaque host and vector. Initiatives to control P. knowlesi should adopt themes of the One Health approach, which details that the management of an infectious disease agent should be scrutinized at the human-animal-ecosystem interface. This review describes factors that have conceivably permitted the emergence and increased transmission rates of P. knowlesi to humans, from the understanding of genetic exchange events between subpopulations of P. knowlesi to the downstream effects of environmental disruption and simian and vector behavioral adaptations. These factors are considered to advise an integrative control strategy that aligns with the One Health approach. It is proposed that surveillance systems address the geographical distribution and transmission clusters of P. knowlesi and enforce ecological regulations that limit forest conversion and promote ecosystem regeneration. Furthermore, combining individual protective measures, mosquito-based feeding trapping tools and biocontrol strategies in synergy with current control methods may reduce mosquito population density or transmission capacity.

TI  - Impact of deforestation on the abundance, diversity, and richness of <i>Culex</i> mosquitoes in a southwest Cameroon tropical rainforest
T2  - JOURNAL OF VECTOR ECOLOGY
AB  - Deforestation is a major threat to biodiversity but little data exist on how deforestation in real-time affects the overall mosquito species community despite its known role in the transmission of diseases. We compared the abundance and diversity of Culex mosquitoes before and after deforestation along a gradient of three different anthropogenic disturbance levels in a tropical rainforest in southwestern Cameroon. The collections were conducted in unlogged forest (January, 2016), selectively logged forest (January, 2017), and within a young palm plantation (October, 2017) using net traps, sweep nets, resting traps, and dipping for immature stages in water bodies. Mosquitoes were morphologically identified to subspecies, groups, and species. A total of 2,556 mosquitoes was collected of which 1,663 (65.06%) belong to the genus Culex, (n=427 (25.68%) in the unlogged forest; n=900 (54.12%) in the selectively logged forest; and n=336 (20.2%) in the young palm plantation) with a significant difference among the habitats. Diversity and richness of mosquitoes varied significantly among habitats with the highest values found in the selectively logged forest (H=2.4; DS=0.87; S=33) and the lowest value in the unlogged forest (H=1.37; DS=0.68; S=13). The results of this study showed that deforestation affects the abundance and diversity of Culex mosquitoes and favors the invasion of anthropophilic mosquitoes. Higher mosquito abundance and diversity in the selectively logged forest than in the pristine forest is notable and some explanations for these differences are discussed.

TI  - Habitat fragmentation and haemoparasites in the common fruit bat, <i>Artibeus jamaicensis</i> (Phyllostomidae) in a tropical lowland forest in Panama
T2  - PARASITOLOGY
AB  - Anthropogenic influence on ecosystems, Such as habitat fragmentation, impacts species diversity and interactions. There is growing evidence that degradation of habitats favours disease and hence affects ecosystem health. The prevalence of haemoparasites in the Common Fruit Bat (Artibeus jamaicensis) in a tropical. lowland forest in Panama was Studied. We assessed the relation of haemoparasite to the general condition of the animals and tested for possible association of haemoparasite prevalence to habitat fragmentation, with special focus on trypanosomes. Overall, a total of 250 A. jamaicensis sampled from fragmented sites, here man-made, forested islands in Lake Gatun, and sites in the adjacent, Continuous forest in and around the Barro Colorado Nature Monument were examined. Using microscopy and DNA-sequencing 2 dominant types of haemoparasite infections, trypanosomes and Litomosoides (Nematoda) were identified. Trypanosome prevalence was significantly higher in bats from forest fragments, than in bats captured in continuous forest. We attribute this to the loss of species richness in forest fragments and specific characteristics of the fragments favouring trypanosome transmission, in particular changes in vegetation cover. Interestingly, the effect of habitat fragmentation on the prevalence of trypanosomes as multi-host parasites Could not be observed in Litomosoides which probably has a higher host specificity and might be affected less by overall diversity loss.

TI  - Guild-specific responses of bats to landscape composition and configuration in fragmented Amazonian rainforest
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - Habitat loss and fragmentation are serious threats to biodiversity, especially in the Amazon Basin, where biodiversity is greatest and deforestation is continuing at an alarming rate. Nonetheless, little is known about the responses of biotas to spatially explicit aspects of landscape structure.
   Bats are a promising indicator group for studying consequences of forest fragmentation in the Neotropics. Therefore, population- and assemblage-level responses of bats to landscape composition and configuration were quantified at each of three focal scales (circles of 1-, 3-, and 5-km radii) at 14 sites in lowland Amazonia.
   Responses to landscape characteristics were scale-dependent. Abundance and richness were higher in moderately fragmented forest than in continuous forest. Moreover, the abundance of each of nine frugivorous species decreased with increasing forest cover.
   The abundance of frugivores probably responded to landscape composition (e.g. percentage forest, mean patch density) because of an increase in early successional fruits and flowers in areas with reduced canopy cover. In contrast, abundances of gleaning animalivores responded to landscape configuration (e.g. edge density), probably by exploiting low-contrast edges (i.e. closed canopy forest patches embedded in secondary forest) while foraging and travelling between higher quality resource patches.
   Synthesis and applications. Species- and ensemble-specific responses to aspects of landscape structure suggest that both compositional and configurational aspects need to be managed effectively in conservation planning. However, conservation decisions based on associations of biodiversity metrics (e.g. richness, diversity and rarity) with landscape structure may be problematic as they are composite characteristics that mask individual responses and potentially reflect only patterns of the dominant species or groups.

TI  - No need to beat around the bushmeat-The role of wildlife trade and conservation initiatives in the emergence of zoonotic diseases
T2  - HELIYON
AB  - Wildlife species constitute a vast and uncharted reservoir of zoonotic pathogens that can pose a severe threat to global human health. Zoonoses have become increasingly impactful over the past decades, and the expanding trade in wildlife is unarguably among the most significant risk factors for their emergence. Despite several warnings from the academic community about the spillover risks associated with wildlife trade, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic underlines that current policies on the wildlife industry are deficient. Conservation initiatives, rather than practices that attempt to eradicate zoonotic pathogens or the wild species that harbour them, could play a vital role in preventing the emergence of life-threatening zoonoses. This review explores how wildlife conservation initiatives could effectively reduce the risk of new zoonotic diseases emerging from the wildlife trade by integrating existing literature on zoonotic diseases and risk factors associated with wildlife trade. Conservation should mainly aim at reducing human-wildlife interactions in the wildlife trade by protecting wildlife habitats and providing local communities with alternative protein sources. In addition, conservation should focus on regulating the legal wildlife trade and education about disease transfer and safer hunting and butchering methods. By uniting efforts for wildlife protection and universal concern for preventing zoonotic epidemics, conservation initiatives have the potential to safeguard both biodiversity, animal welfare, and global human health security.

TI  - Improving rural health care reduces illegal logging and conserves carbon in a tropical forest
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
AB  - Tropical forest loss currently exceeds forest gain, leading to a net greenhouse gas emission that exacerbates global climate change. This has sparked scientific debate on how to achieve natural climate solutions. Central to this debate is whether sustainably managing forests and protected areas will deliver global climate mitigation benefits, while ensuring local peoples' health and well-being. Here, we evaluate the 10-y impact of a human-centered solution to achieve natural climate mitigation through reductions in illegal logging in rural Borneo: an intervention aimed at expanding health care access and use for communities living near a national park, with clinic discounts offsetting costs historically met through illegal logging. Conservation, education, and alternative livelihood programs were also offered. We hypothesized that this would lead to improved health and well-being, while also alleviating illegal logging activity within the protected forest. We estimated that 27.4 km2 of deforestation was averted in the national park over a decade (similar to 70% reduction in deforestation compared to a synthetic control, permuted P = 0.038). Concurrently, the intervention provided health care access to more than 28,400 unique patients, with clinic usage and patient visitation frequency highest in communities participating in the intervention. Finally, we observed a dose-response in forest change rate to intervention engagement (person-contacts with intervention activities) across communities bordering the park: The greatest logging reductions were adjacent to the most highly engaged villages. Results suggest that this community-derived solution simultaneously improved health care access for local and indigenous communities and sustainably conserved carbon stocks in a protected tropical forest.

TI  - Spatial Analysis of Anthropogenic Landscape Disturbance and Buruli Ulcer Disease in Benin
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   Land use and land cover (LULC) change is one anthropogenic disturbance linked to infectious disease emergence. Current research has focused largely on wildlife and vector-borne zoonotic diseases, neglecting to investigate landscape disturbance and environmental bacterial infections. One example is Buruli ulcer (BU) disease, a necrotizing skin disease caused by the environmental pathogen Mycobacterium ulcerans (MU). Empirical and anecdotal observations have linked BU incidence to landscape disturbance, but potential relationships have not been quantified as they relate to land cover configurations.
   Methodology/Principal Findings
   A landscape ecological approach utilizing Bayesian hierarchical models with spatial random effects was used to test study hypotheses that land cover configurations indicative of anthropogenic disturbance were related to Buruli ulcer (BU) disease in southern Benin, and that a spatial structure existed for drivers of BU case distribution in the region. A final objective was to generate a continuous, risk map across the study region. Results suggested that villages surrounded by naturally shaped, or undisturbed rather than disturbed, wetland patches at a distance within 1200m were at a higher risk for BU, and study outcomes supported the hypothesis that a spatial structure exists for the drivers behind BU risk in the region. The risk surface corresponded to known BU endemicity in Benin and identified moderate risk areas within the boundary of Togo.
   Conclusions/Significance
   This study was a first attempt to link land cover configurations representative of anthropogenic disturbances to BU prevalence. Study results identified several significant variables, including the presence of natural wetland areas, warranting future investigations into these factors at additional spatial and temporal scales. A major contribution of this study included the incorporation of a spatial modeling component that predicted BU rates to new locations without strong knowledge of environmental factors contributing to disease distribution.

TI  - Landscape, Climate and Hantavirus Cardiopulmonary Syndrome Outbreaks
T2  - ECOHEALTH
AB  - We performed a literature review in order to improve our understanding of how landscape and climate drivers affect HCPS outbreaks. Anthropogenic landscape changes such as forest loss, fragmentation and agricultural land uses are related with a boost in hantavirus reservoir species abundance and hantavirus prevalence in tropical areas, increasing HCPS risk. Additionally, higher precipitation, especially in arid regions, favors an increase in vegetational biomass, which augments the resources for reservoir rodents, also increasing HCPS risk. Although these relationships were observed, few studies described it so far, and the ones that did it are concentrated in few places. To guide future research on this issue, we build a conceptual model relating landscape and climate variables with HCPS outbreaks and identified research opportunities. We point out the need for studies addressing the effects of landscape configuration, temperature and the interaction between climate and landscape variables. Critical landscape thresholds are also highly relevant, once HCPS risk transmission can increase rapidly above a certain degree of landscape degradation. These studies could be relevant to implement preventive measures, creating landscapes that can mitigate disease spread risk.

TI  - Substantial Organic and Particulate Nitrogen and Phosphorus Export from Geomorphologically Stable African Tropical Forest Landscapes
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
AB  - Aquatic losses of nutrients are important loss vectors in the nutrient budgets of tropical forests. Traditionally, research has focused mainly on losses of inorganic nutrient forms, whereas the potential contribution of organic and particulate losses to the total nutrient export budget is much less constrained. In this study, we quantified full aquatic nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) exports, including inorganic, organic and particulate forms, from a moist tropical lowland forest and a semi-dry Miombo woodland forest within the Congo Basin. While particulate organic N (PON) was the highest N loss vector in the lowland stream (3.34 kg N ha(-1) y(-1); 44% of TN), dissolved organic N (DON) dominated the export in the Miombo stream (1.41 kg N ha(-1) y(.-1); 47% of TN). Aquatic P export was dominated by dissolved organic P (DOP) in both streams, with yields of 0.29 kg P ha(-1) y(-1) (65% of TP) in the lowland and 0.24 kg P ha(-1) y(-1) (69% of TP) in the Miombo. Storm events were driving those losses, exporting disproportionally high N and P loads during short periods of stormflow conditions (32% and 47% of TN and 20% and 40% of TP in the lowland and Miombo, respectively). Our results highlight the need to take particulate and organic forms into account as important loss vectors in the nutrient balance of tropical forests. This finding is of particular importance considering the projected increasing rainfall intensities in many tropical regions which might exacerbate the export of these nutrient forms in the near future.

TI  - Reemergence of Yellow Fever in Brazil: The Role of Distinct Landscape Fragmentation Thresholds
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Yellow Fever Virus (YFV) reemergence in Brazil was followed by human suffering and the loss of biodiversity of neotropical simians on the Atlantic coast. The underlying mechanisms were investigated with special focus on distinct landscape fragmentation thresholds in the affected municipalities. An ecological study in epidemiology is employed to assess the statistical relationship between events of YFV and forest fragmentation in municipal landscapes. Negative binomial regression model showed that highly fragmented forest cover was associated with an 85% increase of events of YFV in humans and simians (RR = 1.85, CI 95% = 1.24-2.75, p=0.003) adjusted by vaccine coverage, population size, and municipality area. Intermediate levels of forest cover combined with higher levels of forest edge densities contribute to the YFV dispersion and the exponential growth of YF cases. Strategies for forest conservation are necessary for the control and prevention of YF and other zoonotic diseases that can spillover from the fragmented forest remains to populated cities of the Brazilian Atlantic coast.

T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - The risk of spillover of zoonotic diseases to humans is changing in response to multiple environmental and societal drivers, particularly in tropical regions where the burden of neglected zoonotic diseases is highest and land use change and forest conversion is occurring most rapidly. Neglected zoonotic diseases can have significant impacts on poor and marginalised populations in low-resource settings but ultimately receive less attention and funding for research and interventions. As such, effective control measures and interventions are often hindered by a limited ecological evidence base, which results in a limited understanding of epidemiologically relevant hosts or vectors and the processes that contribute to the maintenance of pathogens and spillover to humans. Here, we develop a generalisable next generation matrix modelling framework to better understand the transmission processes and hosts that have the greatest contribution to the maintenance of tick-borne diseases with the aim of improving the ecological evidence base and framing future research priorities for tick-borne diseases. Using this model we explore the relative contribution of different host groups and transmission routes to the maintenance of a neglected zoonotic tick-borne disease, Kyasanur Forest Disease Virus (KFD), in multiple habitat types. The results highlight the potential importance of transovarial transmission and small mammals and birds in maintaining this disease. This contradicts previous hypotheses that primates play an important role influencing the distribution of infected ticks. There is also a suggestion that risk could vary across different habitat types but currently more research is needed to evaluate this relationship. In light of these results, we outline the key knowledge gaps for this system and future research priorities that could inform effective interventions and control measures.
   Author summaryThe risk of humans contracting zoonotic diseases (diseases passed from animals to humans) is being altered by changes in the environment. These changes are occurring rapidly in tropical areas, which are burdened with neglected diseases that often disproportionately affect poorer communities. These diseases generally receive little attention and are less well studied. This means we often have a limited understanding of the ecological processes that influence the risk of people catching zoonotic diseases, which can be crucial in designing effective interventions. In this study, we developed mathematical models to highlight the ecological processes that influence the maintenance of Kyasanur Forest Disease, a neglected zoonotic disease affecting people in India. Using this approach, we were able to determine the hosts and forms of transmission that are most likely to play important roles in maintaining this pathogen and understand how risk to humans might vary in different habitats. We were also able to highlight key knowledge gaps and future research priorities that would help to inform interventions. An additional benefit of this approach is that it can also be used for other tick-borne diseases to help understand how pathogens are maintained and to prioritise the research questions that need to be addressed in other disease systems.

TI  - Influence of landscape structure on previous exposure to <i>Leptospira</i> spp. and <i>Brucella abortus</i> in free-living neotropical primates from southern Brazil
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY
AB  - The environments in which neotropical primates live have been undergoing an intense fragmentation process, constituting a major threat to the species' survival and causing resource scarcity, social isolation, and difficulty in dispersal, leaving populations increasingly vulnerable. Moreover, the proximity of wild environments to anthropized landscapes can change the dynamics of pathogens and the parasite-host-environment relationship, creating conditions that favor exposure to different pathogens. To investigate the previous exposure of free-living primates in Rio Grande do Sul State (RS), southern Brazil, to the bacterial agents Leptospira spp. and Brucella abortus, we investigated agglutinating antibodies against 23 serovars of Leptospira spp. using the microscopic agglutination test and B. abortus acidified antigen test in primate serum samples; 101 samples from primates captured between 2002 and 2016 in different forest fragments were used: 63 Alouatta caraya, 36 Alouatta guariba clamitans, and 02 Sapajus nigritus cucullatus. In addition, the forest remnants where the primates were sampled were characterized in a multiscale approach in radii ranging from 200 to 1400 m to investigate the potential relationship of previous exposure to the agent with the elements that make up the landscape structure. The serological investigation indicated the presence of antibodies for at least one of the 23 serovars of Leptospira spp. in 36.6% (37/101) of the samples analyzed, with titers ranging from 100 to 1600. The most observed serovars were Panama (17.8%), Ballum (5.9%), Butembo (5.9%), Canicola (5.9%), Hardjo (4.9%), and Tarassovi (3.9%); no samples were seropositive for Brucella abortus. Decreased forest cover and edge density were the landscape factors that had a significant relationship with Leptospira spp. exposure, indicating that habitat fragmentation may influence contact with the pathogen. The data generated in this study demonstrate the importance of understanding how changes in landscape structure affect exposure to pathogenic microorganisms of zoonotic relevance. Hence, improving epidemiological research and understanding primates' ecological role in these settings can help improve environmental surveillance and conservation strategies for primate populations in different landscapes.

TI  - DEFORESTATION - EFFECTS ON VECTOR-BORNE DISEASE
T2  - PARASITOLOGY
AB  - This review addresses changes in the ecology of vectors and epidemiology of vector-borne diseases which result from deforestation. Selected examples are considered from viral and parasitic infections (arboviruses, malaria, filariases, Chagas Disease and schistosomiasis) where disease patterns have been directly or indirectly influenced by loss of natural tropical forests. A wide range of activities have resulted in deforestation. These include colonisation and settlement, transmigrant programmes, logging, agricultural activities to provide for cash crops, mining, hydropower development and fuelwood collection. Each activity influences the prevalence, incidence and distribution of vector-borne disease. Three main regions are considered - South America, West & Central Africa and South-East Asia. In each, documented changes in vector ecology and behaviour and disease pattern have occurred. Such changes result from human activity at the forest interface and within the forest. They include both deforestation and reafforestation programmes. Deforestation, or activities associated with it, have produced new habitats for Anopheles darlingi mosquitoes and have caused malaria epidemics in South America. The different species complexes in South-East Asia (A. dirus, A. minimus, A. balabacensis) have been affected in different ways by forest clearance with different impacts on malaria incidence. The ability of zoophilic vectors to adapt to human blood as an alternative source of food and to become associated with human dwellings (peridomestic behaviour) have influenced the distribution of the leishmaniases in South America. Certain species of sandflies (Lutzomyia intermedia, Lu. longipalpis, Lu. whitmani), which were originally zoophilic and sylvatic, have adapted to feeding on humans in peridomestic and even periurban situations. The changes in behaviour of reservoir hosts and the ability of pathogens to adapt to new reservoir hosts in the newly-created habitats also influence the patterns of disease. In anthroponotic infections, such as Plasmodium, Onchocerca and Wuchereria, changes in disease patterns and vector ecology may be more difficult to detect. Detailed knowledge of vector species and species complexes is needed in relation to changing climate associated with deforestation. The distributions of the Anopheles gambiae and Simulium damnosum species complexes in West Africa are examples. There have been detailed longitudinal studies of Anopheles gambiae populations in different ecological zones of West Africa. Studies on Simulium damnosum cytoforms (using chromosome identification methods) in the Onchocerciasis Control Programme were necessary to detect changes in distribution of species in relation to changed habitats. These examples underline the need for studies on the taxonomy of medically-important insects in parallel with long-term observations on changing habitats. In some circumstances destruction of the forest has reduced or even removed disease transmission (e.g. S. neavei-transmitted Onchocerca in Kenya). Whilst the process of deforestation can be expected to continue, hopefully at a decreased rate, it is expected that unpredictable and sometimes rapid changes in disease patterns will pose problems for the public health services.

TI  - Impact of Plantation Induced Forest Degradation on the Outbreak of Emerging Infectious Diseases-Wayanad District, Kerala, India
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Simple Summary The emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) have increased recently due to forest degradation. This research is an attempt to understand the direct and indirect impact of forest degradation on infectious disease outbreaks in a specific context of the Wayanad district in Kerala, India. The study was done in two parts. In the first part, land use and land cover change of the Wayanad district was analyzed for the period of 1950 to 2018. The result of the analysis shows that a significant amount of forest has been converted into agricultural and forest plantations over the time. The second part involves understanding the impact of plantations on the outbreak of EIDs. We have employed GIS tools, remote sensing data, extensive field work and disease data to discover the relationship between the LULCC and disease outbreak. It was found that cases of EIDs were high in those gram panchayats where forests were encroached by plantations. The world has been facing a pandemic owing to COVID-19. We have also seen the geographic expansion and outbreaks of other emerging infectious diseases (EID) in recent years. This paper investigates the direct and indirect effects of land use land cover change (LULCC) on EID outbreaks in the context of Wayanad District of Kerala, India. Wayanad is in the vulnerable tropical forested region, and it is named as one of the four environmental change hotspots. The focus of this project is mainly three EIDs prevalent in this region: Kyasanur forest disease (KFD), Dengue and Leptospirosis. Our results, based on topographical map, remote sensing and extensive field work, show that the natural forest in Wayanad was replaced with agriculture and forest plantation during 1950-2018. This paper further suggests that encroachment of forest by forest plantation causes the human-animal conflict resulting in the outbreak of KFD cases. Our analysis reveals that a high number of Dengue cases is found in the forested regions of the district and over the adjacent human-made agriculture plantation areas. High and medium number of Leptospirosis cases contain a high portion of land area devoted to paddy cultivation and agricultural plantation. In summary, the results clearly show the linkage between the outbreak of above mentioned EIDs and LULCC in the context of Wayanad district, Kerala. We also discuss in detail the causal pathway involving human-environmental dynamics through which plantation leads to the outbreak of KFD. Replacing forests with plantations poses an alarming threat of disease outbreak in the community.

TI  - Tropical bat ectoparasitism in continuous versus fragmented forests: A gap analysis and preliminary meta-analysis
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB  - Tropical regions are experiencing rapid rates of forest fragmentation, which can have several effects on wildlife, including altered parasite dynamics. Bats are a useful host group to consider the effects of fragmentation, because they are abundant in the tropics, serve important ecological roles, and harbor many parasites. Nevertheless, research on the effects of fragmentation on bat ectoparasites is still limited. To help guide ongoing and future research efforts, this study had two objectives: (1) conduct a gap analysis to characterize the state of currently available research on fragmentation effects on bat ectoparasites and (2) conduct a preliminary meta-analysis to identify current trends. We systematically highlighted several research gaps: Studies comparing the effects of fragmented versus continuous forests on ectoparasites are limited and have primarily been conducted in the Neotropics, with a focus on bats in the superfamily Noctilionidea (especially frugivorous phyllostomids). Our preliminary meta-analysis suggested that ectoparasite prevalence (but not the mean or variance in intensity) was higher in fragments than in continuous forests. Moreover, prevalence increased with increasing roost duration, and mean intensity was higher for bats with higher wing aspect ratios. Intensity variance was affected by an interaction between forest type and wing aspect ratio, such that variance increased for bats with high-wing aspect ratios in continuous forests but decreased in fragments. These results suggest that fragmentation can shape aspects of bat ectoparasitism and could have implications for the ecology, health, and conservation of bats in fragmented landscapes. However, existing research gaps could bias our current understanding of habitat change and bat health, and future research should thus investigate these effects in the Paleotropics and with other bat families.

TI  - Is zoonotic <i>Plasmodium vivax</i> malaria an obstacle for disease elimination?
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
AB  - Background The groundwork for malaria elimination does not currently consider the potential of Plasmodium zoonotic cycles that involve non-human primates (NHPs) in sylvatic environments. Since vivax malaria is less responsive to control measures, finding Plasmodium vivax infected NHPs adds even more concern. Methods Both Free-living monkeys in forest fragments inside the urban area and captive monkeys from a local zoo had blood samples tested for Plasmodium species. Results In this study, among the Neotropical monkeys tested, three (4.4%), one captive and two free-living, were found to be naturally infected by P. vivax. Conclusion This important finding indicates that it is necessary to estimate the extent to which P. vivax NHP infection contributes to the maintenance of malaria transmission to humans. Therefore, the discussion on wildlife conservation and management must be incorporated into the malaria elimination agenda.

TI  - Landscape Fragmentation as a Risk Factor for Buruli Ulcer Disease in Ghana
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Land cover and its change have been linked to Buruli ulcer (BU), a rapidly emerging tropical disease. However, it is unknown whether landscape structure affects the disease prevalence. To examine the association between landscape pattern and BU presence, we obtained land cover information for 20 villages in southwestern Ghana from high resolution satellite images, and analyzed the landscape pattern surrounding each village. Eight landscape metrics indicated that landscape patterns between BU case and reference villages were different (P < 0.05) at the broad spatial extent examined (4 km). The logistic regression models showed that landscape fragmentation and diversity indices were positively associated with BU presence in a village. Specifically, for each increase in patch density and edge density by 100 units, the likelihood of BU presence in a village increased 2.51 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.36-4.61) and 4.18 (95% CI = 1.63-10.76) times, respectively. The results suggest that increased landscape fragmentation may pose a risk to the emergence of BU.

TI  - Seasonal Fluctuations of Astrovirus, But Not Coronavirus Shedding in Bats Inhabiting Human-Modified Tropical Forests
T2  - ECOHEALTH
AB  - Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) are considered a major threat to global health. Most EIDs appear to result from increased contact between wildlife and humans, especially when humans encroach into formerly pristine habitats. Habitat deterioration may also negatively affect the physiology and health of wildlife species, which may eventually lead to a higher susceptibility to infectious agents and/or increased shedding of the pathogens causing EIDs. Bats are known to host viruses closely related to important EIDs. Here, we tested in a paleotropical forest with ongoing logging and fragmentation, whether habitat disturbance influences the occurrence of astro- and coronaviruses in eight bat species. In contrast to our hypothesis, anthropogenic habitat disturbance was not associated with corona- and astrovirus detection rates in fecal samples. However, we found that bats infected with either astro- or coronaviruses were likely to be coinfected with the respective other virus. Additionally, we identified two more risk factors influencing astrovirus shedding. First, the detection rate of astroviruses was higher at the beginning of the rainy compared to the dry season. Second, there was a trend that individuals with a poor body condition had a higher probability of shedding astroviruses in their feces. The identification of risk factors for increased viral shedding that may potentially result in increased interspecies transmission is important to prevent viral spillovers from bats to other animals, including humans.

TI  - Perspectives on the Changing Landscape of Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease Virus Control
T2  - VIRUSES-BASEL
AB  - Epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) is an insect-transmitted viral disease of wild and domestic ruminants. It was first described following a 1955 epizootic in North American white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), a species which is highly susceptible to the causative agent of EHD, epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV). EHDV has been detected globally across tropical and temperate regions, largely corresponding to the presence of Culicoides spp. biting midges which transmit the virus between ruminant hosts. It regularly causes high morbidity and mortality in wild and captive deer populations in endemic areas during epizootics. Although cattle historically have been less susceptible to EHDV, reports of clinical disease in cattle have increased in the past two decades. There is a pressing need to identify new methods to prevent and mitigate outbreaks and reduce the considerable impacts of EHDV on livestock and wildlife. This review discusses recent research advancements towards the control of EHDV, including the development of new investigative tools and progress in basic and applied research focused on virus detection, disease mitigation, and vector control. The potential impacts and implications of these advancements on EHD management are also discussed.

TI  - Human activities link fruit bat presence to Ebola virus disease outbreaks
T2  - MAMMAL REVIEW
AB  - A significant link between forest loss and fragmentation and outbreaks of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in humans has been documented. Deforestation may alter the natural circulation of viruses and change the composition, abundance, behaviour and possibly viral exposure of reservoir species. This in turn might increase contact between infected animals and humans. Fruit bats of the family Pteropodidae have been suspected as reservoirs of the Ebola virus. At present, the only evidence associating fruit bats with EVD is the presence of seropositive individuals in eight species and polymerase chain reaction-positive individuals in three of these. Our study investigates whether human activities can increase African fruit bat geographical ranges and whether this influence overlaps geographically with EVD outbreaks that, in turn, are favoured by deforestation. We use species observation records for the 20 fruit bat species found in favourable areas for the Ebola virus to determine factors affecting the bats' range inside the predicted Ebola virus area. We do this by employing a hypothetico-deductive approach based on favourability modelling. We show that the range of some fruit bat species is linked to human activities within the favourable areas for the Ebola virus. More specifically, the areas where human activities favour the presence of five fruit bat species overlap with the areas where EVD outbreaks in humans were themselves favoured by deforestation. These five species are as follows: Eidolon helvum, Epomops franqueti, Megaloglossus woermanni, Micropteropus pusillus and Rousettus aegyptiacus. Of these five, all but Megaloglossus woermanni have recorded seropositive individuals. For the remaining 15 bat species, we found no biogeographical support for the hypothesis that positive human influence on fruit bats could be associated with EVD outbreaks in deforested areas within the tropical forest biome in West and Central Africa. Our work is a useful first step allowing further investigation of the networks and pathways that may lead to an EVD outbreak. The modelling framework we employ here can be used for other emerging infectious diseases.

TI  - Climate change, allergy and asthma, and the role of tropical forests
T2  - WORLD ALLERGY ORGANIZATION JOURNAL
AB  - Background: Tropical forests cover less than 10 per cent of all land area (1.8 x 107 km(2)) and over half of the tropical-forest area (1.1 x 107 Km(2)) is represented by humid tropical forests (also called tropical rainforests). The Amazon basin contains the largest rainforest on Earth, almost 5.8 million km(2), and occupies about 40% of South America; more than 60% of the basin is located in Brazil and the rest in Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Peru, Suriname and Venezuela. Over the past decade the positive role of tropical rainforests in capturing large amounts of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) has been demonstrated. In response to the increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration, tropical forests act as a global carbon sink.
   Main body: Accumulation of carbon in the tropical terrestrial biosphere strongly contributes to slowing the rate of increase of CO2 into the atmosphere, thus resulting in the reduction of greenhouse gas effect. Tropical rainforests have been estimated to account for 32-36% of terrestrial Net Primary Productivity (NPP) that is the difference between total forest photosynthesis and plant respiration. Tropical rainforests have been acting as a strong carbon sink in this way for decades. However, over the past years, increased concentrations of greenhouse gases, and especially CO2, in the atmosphere have significantly affected the net carbon balance of tropical rainforests, and have warmed the planet substantially driving climate changes through more severe and prolonged heat waves, variability in temperature, increased air pollution, forest fires, droughts, and floods. The role of tropical forests in mitigating climate change is therefore critical. Over the past 30 years almost 600,000 km(2) have been deforested in Brazil alone due to the rapid development of Amazonia, this is the reason why currently the region is one of the 'hotspots' of global environmental change on the planet.
   Conclusion: Deforestation represents the second largest anthropogenic source of CO2 to the atmosphere, after fossil fuel combustion. There are many causes of deforestation, including socioeconomic and natural factors, such as clearcutting for agriculture, ranching and development, unsustainable logging for timber, as well as droughts, fires and degradation due to climate change. About natural causes of forest degradation, in the context of the Amazon, the major agent of change in the forest ecosystem would most likely be decreased dry-season precipitation. Of the 23 global climate models employed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in their 2007 report, 50-70% predict a substantial (above 20%) reduction of dry-season rainfall in eastern Amazonia under mid-range greenhouse gas emissions scenarios, 40% in central Amazonia and 20% in the west. While annual carbon emissions from fossil-fuel combustion have been continually increasing since 1960s, historical trends of deforestation and associated carbon emissions have remained poorly understood.

TI  - Unplanned land clearing of Colombian rainforests: Spreading like disease?
T2  - LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
AB  - Deforestation often occurs as temporal waves and in localized fronts termed 'deforestation hotspots' driven by economic pulses and population pressure. Of particular concern for conservation planning are 'biodiversity hotspots' where high concentrations of endemic species undergo rapid loss and fragmentation of habitat. We investigate the deforestation process in Caqueta, a biodiversity hotspot and major colonization front of the Colombian Amazon using multi-temporal satellite imagery of the periods 1989-1996-1999-2002. The probabilities of deforestation and regeneration were modeled against soil fertility, accessibility and neighborhood terms, using logistic regression analysis. Deforestation and regeneration patterns and rates were highly variable across the colonization front. The regional average annual deforestation rate was 2.6%, but varied locally between -1.8% (regeneration) and 5.3%, with maximum rates in landscapes with 40-60% forest cover and highest edge densities, showing an analogous pattern to the spread of disease. Soil fertility and forest and secondary vegetation neighbors showed positive and significant relationships with the probability of deforestation. For forest regeneration, soil fertility had a significant negative effect while the other parameters were marginally significant. The logistic regression models across all periods showed a high level of discrimination power for both deforestation and forest regeneration, with ROC values > 0.80. We document the effect of policies and institutional changes on the land clearing process, such as the failed peace process between government and guerillas in 1999-2002, which redirected the spread of deforestation and increased forest regeneration. The implications for conservation in biologically rich areas, such as Caqueta are discussed. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

The landscape of the area is heterogeneous and presents random fragmentation patterns. In recent years, tourist services of the region has been increased promoting an accelerate expansion of hotels, transportation and recreation infrastructure altering the complex landscape. It is important to understand the environmental dynamics through temporal changes on the spatial patterns and to propose a better management of this ecological area to the authorities. This paper addresses a multi-temporal analysis of land cover changes from 1993 to 2000 in Tulum using Thematic Mapper data acquired by Landsat-5. Two independent methodologies were applied for the analysis of changes in the landscape and for the definition of fragmentation patterns. First, an Iteratively Multivariate Alteration Detection (IR-MAD) algorithm was used to detect and localize land cover change/no-change areas. Second, the post-classification change detection evaluated using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. Landscape metrics were calculated from the results of IR-MAD and SVM. The analysis of the metrics indicated, among other things, a higher fragmentation pattern along roadways.

TI  - Reviewing the ecological evidence base for management of emerging tropical zoonoses: Kyasanur Forest Disease in India as a case study
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Author summary
   Zoonotic diseases (caused by pathogens passed between animals and people) disproportionately affect tropical communities. Management to prevent human cases is often hindered by a poor ecological understanding of zoonotic disease systems, which may involve complex communities of vector (e.g., ticks) and host species involved in pathogen transmission. Thus, management usually focuses on human medical treatments such as vaccination. However, there may be other alternative interventions targeted at vectors or wildlife hosts which may be more effective, economical, or long lasting. Furthermore, more conventional human-focused intervention strategies could be improved through better ecological understanding of the disease system. Here, we refine a new framework developed to identify barriers in the disease system that a pathogen needs to overcome in order to spillover to cause human disease cases, to include additional barriers pertinent to vector-borne pathogens. We apply this refined framework to Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD), a potentially deadly tick-borne infection from India which affects poor forest communities in the Western Ghats and demonstrate how it can be used to identify key knowledge gaps that that need to be addressed in order to evaluate the effectiveness of existing management and to design new interventions.
   Zoonoses disproportionately affect tropical communities and are associated with human modification and use of ecosystems. Effective management is hampered by poor ecological understanding of disease transmission and often focuses on human vaccination or treatment. Better ecological understanding of multi-vector and multi-host transmission, social and environmental factors altering human exposure, might enable a broader suite of management options. Options may include "ecological interventions" that target vectors or hosts and require good knowledge of underlying transmission processes, which may be more effective, economical, and long lasting than conventional approaches. New frameworks identify the hierarchical series of barriers that a pathogen needs to overcome before human spillover occurs and demonstrate how ecological interventions may strengthen these barriers and complement human-focused disease control. We extend these frameworks for vector-borne zoonoses, focusing on Kyasanur Forest Disease Virus (KFDV), a tick-borne, neglected zoonosis affecting poor forest communities in India, involving complex communities of tick and host species. We identify the hierarchical barriers to pathogen transmission targeted by existing management. We show that existing interventions mainly focus on human barriers (via personal protection and vaccination) or at barriers relating to Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD) vectors (tick control on cattle and at the sites of host (monkey) deaths). We review the validity of existing management guidance for KFD through literature review and interviews with disease managers. Efficacy of interventions was difficult to quantify due to poor empirical understanding of KFDV-vector-host ecology, particularly the role of cattle and monkeys in the disease transmission cycle. Cattle are hypothesised to amplify tick populations. Monkeys may act as sentinels of human infection or are hypothesised to act as amplifying hosts for KFDV, but the spatial scale of risk arising from ticks infected via monkeys versus small mammal reservoirs is unclear. We identified 19 urgent research priorities for refinement of current management strategies or development of ecological interventions targeting vectors and host barriers to prevent disease spillover in the future.

TI  - A global assessment of closed forests, deforestation and malaria risk
T2  - ANNALS OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND PARASITOLOGY
AB  - Global environmental change is expected to affect profoundly the transmission of the parasites that cause human malaria. Amongst the anthropogenic drivers of change, deforestation is arguably the most conspicuous, and its rate is projected to increase in the coming decades. The canonical epidemiological understanding is that deforestation increases malaria risk in Africa and the Americas and diminishes it in South-east Asia. Partial support for this position is provided here, through a systematic review of the published literature on deforestation, malaria and the relevant vector bionomics. By using recently updated boundaries for the spatial limits of malaria and remotely-sensed estimates of tree cover, it has been possible to determine the population at risk of malaria in closed forest, at least for those malaria-endemic countries that lie within the main blocks of tropical forest. Closed forests within areas of malaria risk cover approximately 1.5 million km(2) in the Amazon region, 1.4 million km(2) in Central Africa, 1.2 million km(2) in the Western Pacific, and 0.7 million km(2) in South-east Asia. The corresponding human populations at risk of malaria within these forests total 11.7 million, 18.7 million, 35.1 million and 70.1 million, respectively. By coupling these numbers with the country-specific rates of deforestation, it has been possible to rank malaria-endemic countries according to their potential for change in the population at risk of malaria, as the result of deforestation. The on-going research aimed at evaluating these relationships more quantitatively, through the Malaria Atlas Project (MAP), is highlighted.

CP  - IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)
AB  - The objective is to estimate forest above-ground biomass (AGB) considering the vertical structures of tropical forest in Mondah test site. Ten DLR F-SAR P-band fully polarized images are utilized to reconstruct the vertical reflectivity through TomoSAR techniques, and then extract multi-feature parameters from vertical profiles of reflectivity, finally these parameters are used for forest AGB estimation with support vector regression (SVR) approach. The results show that the method we proposed for tropical forest AGB estimation is effective and accurate in our test site.

TI  - Degradation and disease: Ecologically unequal exchanges cultivate emerging pandemics
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - An estimated 75 percent of new infectious diseases are zoonotic in origin, directly resulting from human and animal interactions (CDC, 2017). New diseases like COVID-19 most often originate from biodiversity hotspots such as tropical rainforests, and forest loss represents one of the most significant forms of envi-ronmental degradation facilitating new human and animal interactions. A political-economy approach illuminates how trade inequalities lead to the exploitation of the environment and people in poor nations, creating conditions under which pandemics like COVID-19 appear. Cross-national patterns in deforestation and forest use illuminate how consumers in the Global North are keenly tied to the emergence of zoonotic diseases. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - A 70-year perspective on tropical forest regeneration
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Forested areas of the world decreased by 129 million hectare during the past quarter-century, and only 35 % of remainder is primary forest. Secondary forests are therefore relatively more important for biodiversity conservation, catchment protection, climate control, and the ecological services they provide. Many governments expend large resources on afforestation projects, which may not be supported by objective data on rates and pathways of natural succession in secondary forest. This paper describes a 70-year succession of tropical forest in Hong Kong under different management regimes including afforestation programs, frequent fire, and fire protection. From complete destruction of its forest during the Second World War, forest has established rapidly in areas where a shrub cover was able to colonize. The practice of afforestation as a nursery stage on degraded hillsides, for establishment of forest seedlings by natural invasion is not supported by the evidence, as when the native Pinus massoniana plantations were eliminated by disease during the 1970s, no forest or woody species were seen in the areas affected. In fact there was a reversion to grassland, which persisted there for almost three decades, until recent shrub invasion. The fastest period of forest regeneration, at 10.9% annually between 1989 and 2001, occurred when shrubland edge was greatest and forest was able to colonize across interfluves between linear-shaped riparian shrublands in valley bottoms. After 2001, succession to forest was slower, at 7.8% annually, as forest patches consolidated and edge habitats reduced. Effective forest management policies could include seeding of native shrubs extending linearly from established forest, to maximize edge length between woody species and grasslands, and planting of late successional species in areas where forest pioneers are in decline.

TI  - Contact to Non-human Primates and Risk Factors for Zoonotic Disease Emergence in the <i>Ta⟨</i> Region, Cte d'Ivoire
T2  - ECOHEALTH
AB  - Elevated exposure levels to non-human primates (NHP) and NHP bushmeat represent major risk factors for zoonotic disease transmission in sub-Saharan Africa. Demography can affect personal nutritional behavior, and thus rates of contact to NHP bushmeat. Here, we analyzed demographic and NHP contact data from 504 participants of differing demographic backgrounds living in proximity to the Ta < National Park in Western Cte d'Ivoire (CI) to identify factors impacting the risk of NHP exposure. Overall, participants' contact rates to NHP were high, and increased along a gradient of bushmeat processing (e.g., 7.7% hunted, but 61.9% consumed monkeys). Contact to monkeys was significantly more frequent than to chimpanzees, most likely a reflection of meat availability and hunting effort. 17.2% of participants reported previous interaction with NHP pets. Generalized linear mixed model analysis revealed significant effects of sex, country of birth or ethnicity on rates of NHP bushmeat contact, with male participants from CI being at particular risk of exposure to NHP. The presence of zoonotic pathogens in humans and NHP in Ta < further highlights the risk for zoonotic disease emergence in this region. Our results are relevant for formulating prevention strategies to reduce zoonotic pathogen burden in tropical Africa.

TI  - Effects of natural and anthropogenic features on functional connectivity of anurans: a review of landscape genetics studies in temperate, subtropical and tropical species
T2  - JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY
AB  - Habitat loss, overexploitation, the presence of invasive species, climate change and the proliferation of diseases continue to put at risk anuran species that represent 90% of all amphibians. Biphasic life cycle, habitat specialization to oviposit and forage, low dispersal abilities, and permeable skin make anurans particularly susceptible to the effect of landscape composition and configuration on their capacity to move through the landscape (connectivity). Limited connectivity can result in reduced gene flow, low genetic variation and high genetic structuring. Therefore, identifying landscape elements that promote or limit the dispersal of anurans is fundamental to propose conservation plans that allow maintaining areas that enhance connectivity to assure the evolutionary potential of the species by preserving genetic diversity. Here, we reviewed studies evaluating the effect of natural and anthropogenic elements of the landscape on gene flow across temperate, tropical and subtropical landscapes. Our results suggest that roads have the strongest negative effect on connectivity resistance in anurans from temperate regions. Urbanization, fragmentation, and land cover change into agriculture and grasslands are other anthropogenic landscape elements that provide resistance to connectivity in anurans worldwide. In temperate and tropical regions, rivers are the most important natural element negatively affecting connectivity, having a stronger effect in the tropics. Contrary, streams and forests cover promote connectivity in all regions. We provide a review of the growing progress of landscape genetics in this group of vulnerable organisms and highlight the importance of considering this research field for the conservation of the threatened ecosystems that anurans inhabit.

TI  - Community-level analysis of risk of vector-borne disease
T2  - TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Ecological community structure is particularly important in vector-borne zoonotic diseases with complex life cycles. Qualitative community model analysis may provide a meaningful alternative to standard population-based models of vector-borne disease. We built on recent mathematical developments in qualitative community modeling coupled with conventional biomathematical models of vector-borne disease transmission, to provide a procedure to analyze risk. Using this procedure, we can hypothesize changes in risk of vector-borne disease from disturbances, such as control measures, habitat alteration, or global warming. We demonstrate the application of this procedure to an oak forest community to predict the risk of Lyme disease. Our predictions of Lyme disease risk in an oak forest community confirm reports of positive associations between deer abundance and risk of disease and are consistent with published observations.

TI  - Detecting deforestation with a spectral change detection approach using multitemporal Landsat data: A case study of Kinabalu Park, Sabah, Malaysia
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - Tropical deforestation is occuring at in alarming rate, threatening the ecological integrity of protected areas. This makes it vital to regularly assess protected areas to confirm the efficacy of measures that protect that area from clearing. Satellite remote sensing offers a systematic and objective means for detecting bind monitoring deforestation. This paper examines a spectral change approach to detect deforestation using pattern decomposition (PD) coefficients from multitemporal Landsat data. Our results show that the PD coefficients for soil and vegetation can be used to detect deforestation using change vector analysis (CVA). CVA analysis demonstrates that deforestation in the Kinabalu area, Sabah, Malaysia has significantly slowed from 1.22% in period 1 (1973 and 1991) to 0.1% in period 2 (1991 and 1996). A comparison of deforestation both inside and outside Kinabalu Park has highlighted the effectiveness of the park in protecting the tropical forest against clearing. However, the park is still facing pressure from the area immediately surrounding the park (the 1 km buffer zone) where the deforestation rate has remained unchanged. 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Vector role and human biting activity of Anophelinae mosquitoes in different landscapes in the Brazilian Amazon
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
AB  - Background: Environmental disturbance, deforestation and socioeconomic factors all affect malaria incidence in tropical and subtropical endemic areas. Deforestation is the major driver of habitat loss and fragmentation, which frequently leads to shifts in the composition, abundance and spatial distribution of vector species. The goals of the present study were to: (i) identify anophelines found naturally infected with Plasmodium; (ii) measure the effects of landscape on the number of Nyssorhynchus darlingi, presence of Plasmodium-infected Anophelinae, human biting rate (HBR) and malaria cases; and (iii) determine the frequency and peak biting time of Plasmodium-infected mosquitoes and Ny. darlingi.
   Methods: Anopheline mosquitoes were collected in peridomestic and forest edge habitats in seven municipalities in four Amazon Brazilian states. Females were identified to species and tested for Plasmodium by real-time PCR. Negative binomial regression was used to measure any association between deforestation and number of Ny. darlingi, number of Plasmodium-infected Anophelinae, HBR and malaria. Peak biting time of Ny. darlingi and Plasmodium-infected Anophelinae were determined in the 12-h collections. Binomial logistic regression measured the association between presence of Plasmodium-infected Anophelinae and landscape metrics and malaria cases.
   Results: Ninety-one females of Ny. darlingi, Ny. rangeli, Ny. benarrochi B and Ny. konderi B were found to be infected with Plasmodium. Analysis showed that the number of malaria cases and the number of Plasmodium-infected Anophelinae were more prevalent in sites with higher edge density and intermediate forest cover (30-70%).The distance of the drainage network to a dwelling was inversely correlated to malaria risk. The peak biting time of Plasmodium-infected Anophelinae was 00:00-03:00 h. The presence of Plasmodium-infected mosquitoes was higher in landscapes with > 13 malaria cases.
   Conclusions: Nyssorhynchus darlingi, Ny. rangeli, Ny. benarrochi B and Ny. konderi B can be involved in malaria transmission in rural settlements. The highest fraction of Plasmodium-infected Anophelinae was caught from midnight to 03:00 h. In some Amazonian localities, the highest exposure to infectious bites occurs when residents are sleeping, but transmission can occur throughout the night. Forest fragmentation favors increases in both malaria and the occurrence of Plasmodium-infected mosquitoes in peridomestic habitat. The use of insecticide-impregnated mosquito nets can decrease human exposure to infectious Anophelinae and malaria transmission.

TI  - Vulnerability and Resilience of Tropical Forest Species to Land-Use Change
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
AB  - We provide a cross-taxon and historical analysis of what makes tropical forest species vulnerable to extinction. Several traits have been important for species survival in the recent and distant geological past, including seed dormancy and vegetative growth in plants, small body size in mammals, and vagility in insects. For major past catastrophes, such as the five mass extinction events, large range size and vagility or dispersal were key to species survival. Traits that make some species more vulnerable to extinction are consistent across time scales. Terrestrial organisms, particularly animals, are more extinction prone than marine organisms. Plants that persist through dramatic changes often reproduce vegetatively and possess mechanisms of die back. Synergistic interactions between current anthropogenic threats, such as logging, fire, hunting, pests and diseases, and climate change are frequent. Rising temperatures threaten all organisms, perhaps particularly tropical organisms adapted to small temperature ranges and isolated by distance from suitable future climates. Mutualist species and trophic specialists may also be more threatened because of such range-shift gaps. Phylogenetically specialized groups may be collectively more prone to extinction than generalists. Characterization of tropical forest species' vulnerability to anthropogenic change is constrained by complex interactions among threats and by both taxonomic and ecological impediments, including gross undersampling of biotas and poor understanding of the spatial patterns of taxa at all scales.

TI  - Neotropical Zoonotic Parasites in Bush Dogs (<i>Speothos venaticus</i>) from Upper Parana Atlantic Forests in Misiones, Argentina
T2  - VECTOR-BORNE AND ZOONOTIC DISEASES
AB  - Wildlife remains an important source of zoonotic diseases for the most vulnerable groups of humans, primarily those living in rural areas or coexisting with forest. The Upper Parana Atlantic forest of Misiones, Argentina is facing ongoing environmental and anthropogenic changes, which affect the local biodiversity, including the bush dog (Speothos venaticus), a small canid considered Near Threatened globally and Endangered locally. This project aimed to expand the knowledge of zoonotic parasites present in the bush dog and the potential implications for human health and conservation medicine. From May to August 2011, a detection dog located 34 scats that were genetically confirmed as bush dog and georeferenced to northern Misiones. Of these 34 scats, 27 had sufficient quantity that allowed processing for zoonotic parasites using morphological (sedimentation and flotation) and antigen (coproantigen technique) analyses. Within these 27 scats, we determined that the parasitic prevalence was 63.0% (n = 17) with 8 (47.1%) having mixed infections with 2-4 parasitic genera. No significant differences (p > 0.05) between sampling areas, sex, and parasite taxa were found. We were able to summarize the predominant nematodes (Ancylostoma caninum, Toxocara canis, and Lagochilascaris spp.), cestodes (Taenia spp. and Spirometra spp.), and apicomplexa (Cystoisospora caninum) found in these bush dogs. With the copro-ELISA technique, 14.8% (n = 4) of the samples were positive for Echinococcus spp. This study represents the first comprehensive study about parasitic fauna with zoonotic potential in the free-ranging bush dog. This information combined with the innovative set of techniques used to collect the samples constitute a valuable contribution that can be used in control programs, surveillance of zoonotic diseases, and wildlife conservation, both regionally and across the bush dog's broad distribution.

TI  - TROPICAL NATURAL FOREST CLASSIFICATION USING TIME-SERIES SENTINEL-1 AND LANDSAT-8 IMAGES IN HAINAN ISLAND
T2  - 2019 IEEE INTERNATIONAL GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING SYMPOSIUM (IGARSS 2019)
CP  - IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)
AB  - Tropical natural forest plays an important role in environmental change and biodiversity researches. However, the complexity of structures and its cloudy and rainy environment make tropical natural forest classification difficult. Taking Hainan, China as study area, we conduct a tropical natural forest classification study by combining multi-temporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images collected from Sentinel-1 satellite and optical images collected from Landsat-8 satellite in this paper. The backscatter coefficient, spectrum information, digital elevation mod (DEM), temporal information offered by multiple remote sensing data have been analyzed to identify the evergreen and deciduous broad-leaved forest, evergreen coniferous forest, tropical monsoon forest, typical tropical rain forest and other forest types. In addition, a two-stage tropical forest classification strategy is proposed based on support vector machine (SVM) classifiers, namely the primary land cover type classification and tropical natural forest type classification in which the time-series backscattering information is used. Finally, the Hainan tropical forest mapping image is obtained based on the proposed classification strategy and the overall accuracy reaches to 90% based on field survey data. The results show the effectiveness of the classification strategy on tropical natural forest classification.

TI  - The Harvest of Tropical Wildlife for Bushmeat and Traditional Medicine
T2  - ANNUAL REVIEW OF ENVIRONMENT AND RESOURCES, VOL 45
AB  - Bushmeat is not only an important source of fat, micronutrients, and macronutrients, but it also has medicinal uses. Extensive human-wildlife interactions may lead to pathogen exchange and trigger zoonotic infectious disease outbreaks such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, Ebola, and coronavirus disease 2019. In the tropics, bushmeat has become one of the most threatened resources due to widespread habitat loss and overexploitation, largely driven by increased global demand, weak governance, and lack of enforcement. Unsustainable harvesting, consumption, and production practices are common, although drivers are complex and intertwined and vary regionally, pointing to a looming rural nutrition security and wildlife conservation issue. Growing demand in fast urbanizing markets coupled with easy access fuels the illegal trade of bushmeat, medicinal products, and wildlife-based luxury goods. Although bushmeat contributes significantly to rural people's income and poverty alleviation, overharvesting impacts those who are most dependent on the forest. To balance the rural and cultural importance of bushmeat with conservation and public health priorities, strategies to safeguard tropical biodiversity, sustainable harvest of wildlife with reduced health risk for nutrition and medicine are urgently needed.

TI  - Life history characteristics and rarity of woody plants in tropical dry forest fragments of Central America
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY
AB  - Breeding systems and dispersal mechanisms of plants (greater than or equal to 2.5 cm dbh) were examined in fragments of tropical dry fc,rest in Central America to identify life-history characteristics associated with rarity. In particular, the richness and abundance of dioecious and mammal-dispersed trees and shrubs were examined to identify potential associations with precipitation, anthropogenic disturbance, and area. Plots totalling 1000 m(2) per site were established in seven nature reserves in Costa Rica (two sites) and Nicaragua (five sites). Overall, tropical dry forests of Central America have a similar proportion of dioecious species to other lowland neotropical forests and a similar proportion of wind-dispersed plants to other tropical dry forests around the world. However, the number of dioecious and mammal-dispersed species declined with decreasing forest cover within each reserve. Although dioecious species were rare in smaller forest fragments, some of these species will not be threatened with regional extinction because they are early successional plants, they have large geographic ranges, and they are not restricted to the tropical dry forest life zone. Mammal-dispersed plants were rare in small fragments, but it is not clear whether this was due to the loss of dispersal vectors or other life-history characteristics.

TI  - Effects of landscape disturbance on mosquito community composition in tropical Australia
T2  - JOURNAL OF VECTOR ECOLOGY
AB  - Emerging infectious diseases are considered to be a growing threat to human and wildlife health. Such diseases might be facilitated by anthropogenic land-use changes that cause novel juxtapositions of different habitats and species and result in new interchanges of vectors, diseases, and hosts. To search for such effects in tropical Australia, we sampled mosquito populations across anthropogenic disturbance gradients of grassland, artificial rainforest edge, and rainforest interior. From >15,000 captured mosquitoes, we identified 26 species and eight genera. Surprisingly, there was no significant difference in community composition or species richness between forest edges and grasslands, but both differed significantly from rainforest interiors. Mosquito species richness was elevated in grasslands relative to the rainforest habitats. Seven species were unique to grasslands and edges, with another 13 found across all habitats. Among the three most abundant species, Culex annulirostris occurred in all habitat types, whereas Verrallina lineata and Cx. pullus were more abundant in forest interiors. Our findings suggest that the creation of anthropogenic grasslands adjacent to rainforests may increase the susceptibility of species in both habitats to transmission of novel diseases via observable changes and mixing of the vector community on rainforest edges.

TI  - Increasing signs of forest fragmentation in the Cross River National Park in Nigeria: Underlying drivers and need for sustainable responses
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
AB  - Protected areas are expectedly intact habitats for biodiversity and key for ecosystem conservation. However, where inadequately protected, human-induced forest fragmentation can degrade them and reduce their functioning. Therefore, monitoring forests in protected areas is essential to ascertain their protection. This paper assesses forest fragmentation in the Cross River National Park, a biodiversity hotspot in the tropical rainforest of Nigeria. Forest fragmentation was analyzed using the Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response framework. Fragmentation analysis of the State used class-level pattern metrics on Landsat and Sentinel images from the years 2000, 2015 and 2020. Forest fragmentation has reduced total forest area, decreased average size of forest patches, increased the number of forest patches and amount of edge. Only the isolation of forest patches has not yet reached a measurable intensity. However, spatio-temporal forest fragmentation over the years 2000, 2015 and 2020 indicates a rising trend, especially between 2015 and 2020. The Drivers, Pressures, Impacts and Responses were investigated through a systematic literature review. Many studies show that the main proximate Drivers of forest fragmentation are agricultural activities mainly by the local communities, demand for forest resources by the growing population, and by external actors through illegal logging and infrastructure building, which have increased. However, wider literature highlight issues of disproportionately blaming local resource users, and the need to examine the neglect of justice, rights and local values, and their implications for sustainable protected areas. Reported Impacts include hindered migration of the endangered Cross River gorilla and impaired ecosystem services like water cycling, carbon sequestration and disease regulation. Responses have generally excluded the local communities, have failed or are yet to become effective. There is thus a need to identify, together with the involved actors, why measures have failed and to implement more sustainable options to reduce fragmentation in the park while addressing local users' needs.

TI  - Comparison of Modeling Algorithms for Forest Canopy Structures Based on UAV-LiDAR: A Case Study in Tropical China
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Knowledge of forest structure is vital for sustainable forest management decisions. Terrestrial laser scanning cannot describe the canopy trees in a large area, and it is unclear whether unmanned aerial vehicle-light detection and ranging (UAV-LiDAR) data have the ability to capture the forest canopy structural parameters in tropical forests. In this study, we estimated five forest canopy structures (stand density (N), basic area (G), above-ground biomass (AGB), Lorey's mean height (HL), and under-crown height (hT)) with four modeling algorithms (linear regression (LR), bagged tree (BT), support vector regression (SVR), and random forest (RF)) based on UAV-LiDAR data and 60 sample plot data from tropical forests in Hainan and determined the optimal algorithms for the five canopy structures by comparing the performance of the four algorithms. First, we defined the canopy tree as a tree with a height >= 70% HL. Then, UAV-LiDAR metrics were calculated, and the LiDAR metrics were screened by recursive feature elimination (RFE). Finally, a prediction model of the five forest canopy structural parameters was established by the four algorithms, and the results were compared. The metrics' screening results show that the most important LiDAR indexes for estimating HL, AGB, and hT are the leaf area index and some height metrics, while the most important indexes for estimating N and G are the kurtosis of heights and the coefficient of variation of height. The relative root mean squared error (rRMSE) of five structure parameters showed the following: when modeling HL, the rRMSEs (10.60%-12.05%) obtained by the four algorithms showed little difference; when N was modeled, BT, RF, and SVR had lower rRMSEs (26.76%-27.44%); when G was modeled, the rRMSEs of RF and SVR (15.37%-15.87%) were lower; when hT was modeled, BT, RF, and SVR had lower rRMSEs (10.24%-11.07%); when AGB was modeled, RF had the lowest rRMSE (26.75%). Our results will help facilitate choosing LiDAR indexes and modeling algorithms for tropical forest resource inventories.

TI  - Frost-driven lower treelines in Angola and their implications for tropical forest-grassland mosaics
T2  - JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE
AB  - Questions Forest-grassland boundaries in the tropics are primarily interpreted as driven by fire and herbivory. So far, frost has received little attention as driver of tropical vegetation boundaries. Here, we study mid-altitudes in south-central Africa and ask the following questions: (a) is there a lower treeline between grasslands and forests on the Angolan Plateau; (b) if so, do topoclimatic differences play a role in it; and (c) what do our results imply for tropical highlands globally? Location The Angolan Plateau (10 degrees-16 degrees S and 13 degrees-21 degrees E). Methods We mapped vegetation by applying a supervised support vector machine-based classification on a Landsat satellite image. We used a 1,000-m spaced point grid to extract the mean vertical distribution of the vegetation units from a digital elevation model. The topographic position of each point was calculated using a channel network approach. Microclimatic data were collected across topographic gradients at two sites along the Plateau. Analyses focussed on the number of nights where temperature dropped below 0celcius, median and minimum temperatures, and diurnal temperature ranges. Results Lower treelines separate Miombo forests from geoxyle grasslands in all major valley systems. Treelines are located 150-200 m below the headwater divides. Nocturnal outgoing net long-wave radiation and resulting cold-air pooling cause frequent frosts in the valleys during the dry season. Topography controls frost patterns, with minima of down to -7.5celcius and diurnal temperature amplitudes up to 40celcius. Conclusions The results show that vegetation patterns in central Angola are shaped by frost. The processes causing frost depend on air humidity. Drier atmosphere and lower global temperatures indicate a longer frost season, lower minima and frost extending to lower elevations and latitudes for the Pleistocene. Pleistocene forest fragmentations and the rise of endemism-rich grasslands in comparable tropical highlands worldwide may be explained by crossing thermic thresholds via increasing seasonal aridity.

T2  - XXIV ISPRS CONGRESS: IMAGING TODAY, FORESEEING TOMORROW, COMMISSION III
CP  - 24th ISPRS Congress on Imaging Today, Foreseeing Tomorrow
AB  - Deep learning methods are known to demand large amounts of labeled samples for training. For remote sensing applications such as change detection, coping with that demand is expensive and time-consuming. This work aims at investigating a noisy-label-based weak supervised method in the context of a deforestation mapping application, characterized by a high class imbalance between the classes of interest, i.e., deforestation and no-deforestation. The study sites correspond to different regions in the Amazon and Brazilian Cerrado biomes. To mitigate the lack of ground-truth labeled training samples, we devised an unsupervised pseudo-labeling scheme based on the Change Vector Analysis technique. The experimental results indicate that the proposed approach can improve the accuracy of deforestation detection applications.

TI  - Disentangling the drivers of reduced long-distance seed dispersal by birds in an experimentally fragmented landscape
T2  - ECOLOGY
AB  - Seed dispersal is a crucial component of plant population dynamics. Human landscape modifications, such as habitat destruction and fragmentation, can alter the abundance of fruiting plants and animal dispersers, foraging rates, vector movement, and the composition of the disperser community, all of which can singly or in concert affect seed dispersal. Here, we quantify and tease apart the effects of landscape configuration, namely, fragmentation of primary forest and the composition of the surrounding forest matrix, on individual components of seed dispersal of Heliconia acuminata, an Amazonian understory herb. First we identified the effects of landscape configuration on the abundance of fruiting plants and six bird disperser species. Although highly variable in space and time, densities of fruiting plants were similar in continuous forest and fragments. However, the two largest-bodied avian dispersers were less common or absent in small fragments. Second, we determined whether fragmentation affected foraging rates. Fruit removal rates were similar and very high across the landscape, suggesting that Heliconia fruits are a key resource for small frugivores in this landscape. Third, we used radiotelemetry and statistical models to quantify how landscape configuration influences vector movement patterns. Bird dispersers flew farther and faster, and perched longer in primary relative to secondary forests. One species also altered its movement direction in response to habitat boundaries between primary and secondary forests. Finally, we parameterized a simulation model linking data on fruit density and disperser abundance and behavior with empirical estimates of seed retention times to generate seed dispersal patterns in two hypothetical landscapes. Despite clear changes in bird movement in response to landscape configuration, our simulations demonstrate that these differences had negligible effects on dispersal distances. However, small fragments had reduced densities of Turdus albicollis, the largest-bodied disperser and the only one to both regurgitate and defecate seeds. This change in Turdus abundance acted together with lower numbers of fruiting plants in small fragments to decrease the probability of long-distance dispersal events from small patches. These findings emphasize the importance of foraging style for seed dispersal and highlight the primacy of habitat size relative to spatial configuration in preserving biotic interactions.

TI  - Recovery of tree and mammal communities during large-scale forest regeneration in Kibale National Park, Uganda
T2  - BIOTROPICA
AB  - Tropical landscapes are changing rapidly as a result of human modifications; however, despite increasing deforestation, human population growth, and the need for more agricultural land, deforestation rates have exceeded the rate at which land is converted to cropland or pasture. For deforested lands to have conservation value requires an understanding of regeneration rates of vegetation, the rates at which animals colonize and grow in regenerating areas, and the nature of interactions between plants and animals in the specific region. Here, we present data on forest regeneration and animal abundance at four regenerating sites that had reached the stage of closed canopy forest where the average dbh of the trees was 17 cm. Overall, 20.3 percent of stems were wind-dispersed species and 79.7 percent were animal-dispersed species, while in the old-growth forest 17.3 percent of the stems were wind-dispersed species. The regenerating forest supported a substantial primate population and encounter rate (groups per km walked) in the regenerating sites was high compared to the neighboring old-growth forests. By monitoring elephant tracks for 10 yr, we demonstrated that elephant numbers increased steadily over time, but they increased dramatically since 2004. In general, the richness of the mammal community detected by sight, tracks, feces, and/or camera traps, was high in regenerating forests compared to that documented for the national park. We conclude that in Africa, a continent that has seen dramatic declines in the area of old-growth forest, there is ample opportunity to reclaim degraded areas and quickly restore substantial animal populations.

T2  - INFECTIOUS DISEASE CLINICS OF NORTH AMERICA
AB  - Tropical medicine deals with infectious and noninfectious diseases geographically located between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn. It encompasses diseases that result from poverty, poor sanitation, infrastructure, and inadequate health resources. Lack of availability of clean water and food made with unhygienic practices add to the morbidity of these diseases. The tropics are reeling under the onslaught of climate change, deforestation, and air, water, and soil pollution, which worsens an already fragile health system. This article provides an overview of the definition, classification, geophysical problems, syndromic approach to common tropical infections, diagnostic challenges in the tropics, and access to medicines.

TI  - Worldwide impacts of landscape anthropization on mosquito abundance and diversity: A meta-analysis
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - In recent decades, the emergence and resurgence of vector-borne diseases have been well documented worldwide, especially in tropical regions where protection and defense tools for human populations are still very limited. In this context, the dynamics of pathogens are influenced by landscape anthropization (i.e., urbanization, deforestation, and agricultural development), and one of the mechanisms through which this occurs is a change in the abundance and/or diversity of the vectors. An increasing number of empirical studies have described heterogeneous effects of landscape anthropization on vector communities; therefore, it is difficult to have an overall picture of these effects on a global scale. Here, we performed a meta-analysis to quantify the impacts of landscape anthropization on a global scale on the presence/abundance and diversity of mosquitoes, the most important arthropods affecting human health. We obtained 338 effect sizes on 132 mosquito species, compiled from 107 studies in 52 countries that covered almost every part of the world. The results of the meta-analysis showed an overall decline of mosquito presence/abundance and diversity in response to urbanization, deforestation, and agricultural development, except for a few mosquito species that have been able to exploit landscape anthropization well. Our results highlighted that these few favored mosquito species are those of global concern. They, thus, provide a better understanding of the overall effect of landscape anthropization on vector communities and, more importantly, suggest a greater risk of emergence and transmission of vector-borne diseases in human-modified landscapes.

TI  - Influence of plant abundance on disease incidence in a Mexican tropical forest
T2  - ECOSCIENCE
AB  - In this paper we investigate to what extent the occurrence of foliar diseases is affected by plant relative abundance in the understory community of the Los Tuxtlas tropical rain forest, how this changes with season of the year, and how plant species with different life histories present at the understory are affected by disease. To provide a context to these analyses we also include a general description of the floristic composition of the understory community. Using the eight most common species, we found that their relative abundance in each sampling location significantly explained the proportion of diseased plants. Accordingly, using the relative abundance of all plant species, we found that the probability of a host plant species being free of infection showed a significant decrement with abundance. At the plant level, we found that relative abundance had the greatest effect on the variation in leaf area/plant affected by pathogens, although the proportion of explained deviance was only 12%. Seasonality did not affect disease incidence and disease levels per plant. Throughout the year, plant relative abundance was very much lower in lianas, tree seedlings, and palms than in perennial herbs and ferns, and disease incidence was very much higher in the latter two, the most abundant life forms. These results collectively suggest that both intraspecific and interspecific variation in plant relative abundance explain variation in leaf damage by pathogenic fungi in tropical forest understories.

TI  - ON THE USE OF SHORTWAVE INFRARED FOR TREE SPECIES DISCRIMINATION IN TROPICAL SEMIDECIDUOUS FOREST
T2  - ISPRS GEOSPATIAL WEEK 2015
CP  - ISPRS Geospatial Week
AB  - Tree species mapping in tropical forests provides valuable insights for forest managers. Keystone species can be located for collection of seeds for forest restoration, reducing fieldwork costs. However, mapping of tree species in tropical forests using remote sensing data is a challenge due to high floristic and spectral diversity. Little is known about the use of different spectral regions as most of studies performed so far used visible/near-infrared (390-1000 nm) features. In this paper we show the contribution of shortwave infrared (SWIR, 1045-2395 nm) for tree species discrimination in a tropical semideciduous forest. Using high-resolution hyperspectral data we also simulated WorldView-3 (WV-3) multispectral bands for classification purposes. Three machine learning methods were tested to discriminate species at the pixel-level: Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Support Vector Machines with Linear (L-SVM) and Radial Basis Function (RBF-SVM) kernels, and Random Forest (RF). Experiments were performed using all and selected features from the VNIR individually and combined with SWIR. Feature selection was applied to evaluate the effects of dimensionality reduction and identify potential wavelengths that may optimize species discrimination. Using VNIR hyperspectral bands, RBF-SVM achieved the highest average accuracy (77.4%). Inclusion of the SWIR increased accuracy to 85% with LDA. The same pattern was also observed when WV-3 simulated channels were used to classify the species. The VNIR bands provided and accuracy of 64.2% for LDA, which was increased to 79.8 % using the new SWIR bands that are operationally available in this platform. Results show that incorporating SWIR bands increased significantly average accuracy for both the hyperspectral data and WorldView-3 simulated bands.

TI  - Haiti's biodiversity threatened by nearly complete loss of primary forest
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
AB  - Tropical forests hold most of Earth's biodiversity. Their continued loss through deforestation and agriculture is the main threat to species globally, more than disease, invasive species, and climate change. However, not all tropical forests have the same ability to sustain biodiversity. Those that have been disturbed by humans, including forests previously cleared and regrown (secondary growth), have lower levels of species richness compared with undisturbed (primary) forests. The difference is even greater considering extinctions that will later emanate from the disturbance (extinction debt). Here, we find that Haiti has less than 1% of its original primary forest and is therefore among the most deforested countries. Primary forest has declined over three decades inside national parks, and 42 of the 50 highest and largest mountains have lost all primary forest. Our surveys of vertebrate diversity (especially amphibians and reptiles) on mountaintops indicates that endemic species have been lost along with the loss of forest. At the current rate, Haiti will lose essentially all of its primary forest during the next two decades and is already undergoing a mass extinction of its biodiversity because of deforestation. These findings point to the need, in general, for better reporting of forest cover data of relevance to biodiversity, instead of "total forest" as defined by the United Nation's Food and Agricultural Organization. Expanded detection and monitoring of primary forest globally will improve the efficiency of conservation measures, inside and outside of protected areas.

TI  - A machine learning approach to mapping canopy gaps in an indigenous tropical submontane forest using WorldView-3 multispectral satellite imagery
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Selective logging in tropical forests may lead to deforestation and forest degradation, so accurate mapping of it will assist in forest restoration, among other ecological applications. This study aimed to track canopy tree loss due to illegal logging of the important hardwood tree Ocotea usambarensis in a closed-canopy submontane tropical forest by evaluating the mapping potential of the very-high-resolution WorldView-3 multispectral dataset using random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) with radial basis function kernel classifiers. The results show average overall accuracies of 92.3 +/- 2.6% and 94.0 +/- 2.1% for the RF and SVM models, respectively. Average kappa coefficients were 0.88 +/- 0.03 for RF and 0.90 +/- 0.02 for SVM. The user's and producer's accuracies for both classifiers were in the range of 84-100%. This study further indicates that vegetation indices derived from bands 5 and 6 helped detect canopy gaps in the study area. Both variable importance measurement in the RF algorithm and pairwise feature selection proved useful in identifying the most pertinent variables in the classification of canopy gaps. These findings could allow forest managers to improve methods of detecting canopy gaps at larger scales using remote sensing data and relatively little additional fieldwork.

TI  - Human Activities Attract Harmful Mosquitoes in a Tropical Urban Landscape
T2  - ECOHEALTH
AB  - Knowledge of the interrelationship of mosquito communities and land use changes is of paramount importance to understand the potential risk of mosquito disease transmission. This study examined the effects of land use types in urban, peri-urban and natural landscapes on mosquito community structure to test whether the urban landscape is implicated in increased prevalence of potentially harmful mosquitoes. Three land use types (park, farm, and forest nested in urban, peri-urban and natural landscapes, respectively) in Klang Valley, Malaysia, were surveyed for mosquito larval habitat, mosquito abundance and diversity. We found that the nature of human activities in land use types can increase artificial larval habitats, supporting container-breeding vector specialists such as Aedes albopictus, a dengue vector. In addition, we observed a pattern of lower mosquito richness but higher mosquito abundance, characterised by the high prevalence of Ae. albopictus in the urban landscape. This was also reflected in the mosquito community structure whereby urban and peri-urban landscapes were composed of mainly vector species compared to a more diverse mosquito composition in natural landscape. This study suggested that good environmental management practices in the tropical urban landscape are of key importance for effective mosquito-borne disease management.

TI  - Contrasting responses of plant herbivory and disease to local and landscape drivers
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
AB  - Aim Plant herbivory and disease, which are often associated with each other but subject to different processes, are pivotal in biodiversity maintenance and ecosystem function. Although drivers of plant herbivory and disease have been widely studied separately, their relationships, patterns and determinants remain unclear in fragmented landscapes. Methods We surveyed incidence and severity of foliar herbivory and disease of 2,027 adult trees within 30 sites in 17 tropical forest fragments in Xishuangbanna, southwestern China. We aim to explore the relationship of plant herbivory and disease, and effects of local environmental variables (forest type, plant richness, elevation, slope, soil properties) and landscape environmental variables (patch size, edge distance, isolation). Results We found that incidence, but not severity of disease was positively correlated with that of herbivory. Herbivory severity and incidence were more associated with local variables; both increased with plant richness but decreased with soil nutrients and pH. In contrast, the landscape variable isolation was the dominant driver of disease, with lower severity and incidence in contiguous forests than forest fragments. Conclusion In summary, we show that herbivory and disease are associated with drivers at different scales in fragmented landscapes. Herbivory is mainly driven by local-scale variables, while disease is mainly driven by landscape-scale variables. To control plant herbivory and disease in fragmented landscapes, increasing landscape connectivity and conserving different forest types are urgently required to maintain ecosystem functions under global land use change.

TI  - Quantifying Changes on Forest Succession in a Dry Tropical Forest Using Angular-Hyperspectral Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - The tropical dry forest (TDF) is one the most threatened ecosystems in South America, existing on a landscape with different levels of ecological succession. Among satellites dedicated to Earth observation and monitoring ecosystem succession, CHRIS/PROBA is the only satellite that presents quasi-simultaneous multi-angular pointing and hyperspectral imaging. These two characteristics permit the study of structural and compositional differences of TDFs with different levels of succession. In this paper, we use 2008 and 2014 CHRIS/PROBA images from a TDF in Minas Gerais, Brazil to study ecosystem succession after abandonment. Using a -55 degrees angle of observation; several classifiers including spectral angle mapper (SAM), support vector machine (SVM), and decision trees (DT) were used to test how well they discriminate between different successional stages. Our findings suggest that the SAM is the most appropriate method to classify TDFs as a function of succession (accuracies similar to 80 for % for late stage, similar to 85% for the intermediate stage, similar to 70% for early stage, and similar to 50% for other classes). Although CHRIS/PROBA cannot be used for large-scale/long-term monitoring of tropical forests because of its experimental nature; our results support the potential of using multi-angle hyperspectral data to characterize the structure and composition of TDFs in the near future.

TI  - Infestation dynamics of <i>Triatoma dimidiata</i> in highly deforested tropical dry forest regions of Guatemala
T2  - MEMORIAS DO INSTITUTO OSWALDO CRUZ
AB  - BACKGROUND Deforestation, driven by anthropogenic change in land use, influences the behaviour and abundance of vectorborne diseases. For various species of Chagas disease vectors, there is evidence that change in land use affects population density and abundance. Triatoma dimidiata is the most important Chagas vector in Guatemala, and at least one million people live in T. dimidiata endemic areas; however, infestation dynamics vary among regions, from high infestation with all life stages to low seasonal infestation by sylvatic adults.
   OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to evaluate how land-use, combined with domiciliary risk factors, influences the infestation dynamics of T. dimidiata for four villages in a dry forest region with a strong deforestation history.
   METHODS Land use, measured with drone and satellite images, was classified into four categories (houses, monocultures and pastures, woodland and shrubland, and bare soil). Domiciliary risk factors and infestation were assessed through entomological surveys. Statistical analyses compared infestation indices and the ability of land use and domiciliary risk factors to explain infestation.
   FINDINGS Two villages had significantly higher infestation (26 and 30% vs. 5 and 6%), yet all villages had high colonisation (71-100% of infested houses had immature insects), with no significant difference among them. Because of the high level of deforestation across the study area, land use was not related to infestation; however, domiciliary risk factors were. A model based on four weighted domiciliary risk factors (adobe or bajareque walls, intradomicile animals, intradomicile clutter, and dirt floors) explains the infestation risk.
   MAIN CONCLUSIONS Because almost all infested houses have reproducing populations in this deforested dry forest region and statistical analysis identified the domiciliary risk factors for infestation, intermediate and long-term control of Chagas disease vectors in this region requires management of these risk factors.

TI  - Development of a subgenomic clone system for Kyasanur Forest disease virus
T2  - TICKS AND TICK-BORNE DISEASES
AB  - Emerging tropical viruses pose an increasing threat to public health because social, economic and environmental factors such as global trade and deforestation allow for their migration into previously unexposed populations and ecological niches. Among such viruses, Kyasanur Forest disease virus (KFDV) deserves particular recognition because it causes hemorrhagic fever. This work describes the completion of an antiviral testing platform (subgenomic system) for KFDV that could be used to quickly and safely screen compounds capable of inhibiting KFDV replication without the requirement for high containment, as the structural genes have been replaced with a luciferase reporter gene precluding the generation of infectious particles. The coordination of KFDV kinetics with the replication characteristics of the subgenomic system has provided additional insight into the timing of flavivirus replication events, as the genetically engineered KFDV genome began replication as early as 2 h post cellular entry. Possession of such antiviral testing platforms by public health agencies should accelerate the testing, of antiviral drugs against emerging or recently emerged viruses mitigating the effects of their disease and transmission.

TI  - Effective gene flow patterns across a fragmented landscape in southern Costa Rica for <i>Symphonia globulifera</i> (Clusiaceae); a species with mobile seed and pollen dispersers
T2  - REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL
AB  - In tropical trees, forest fragmentation has been shown to affect mating and gene flow patterns. Mobile dispersal vectors should be less sensitive to fragmented landscapes and may ameliorate the genetic effects of forest fragmentation on plant populations. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed gene flow patterns in Symphonia globulifera, a tropical tree species with highly mobile pollinators and seed dispersers in the Osa Peninsula in southern Costa Rica. We used microsatellites to study genetic diversity and realized gene flow patterns between a continuous forest and a forest fragment. We found high levels of genetic diversity in adults and seedlings at both sites. Parentage analyses suggest near-neighbor matings and frequent long-distance gene flow events. Half the progeny beneath an adult was not sired by that tree and the majority of established seedlings were the result of long-distance gene dispersal. Gene flow from the forest into the fragment was more common than from the fragment into the continuous forests. Despite long distance gene flow events, seedling spatial genetic structure was stronger and extended further in the forest fragment likely due to limited seed dispersal. We conclude that fragmentation affects gene flow in this tropical tree and may compromise its genetic diversity in forest fragments even for a species with mobile pollen and seed vectors.

TI  - Long-term rain forest succession and landscape change in Hawai'i: The 'Maui Forest Trouble' revisited
T2  - JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE
AB  - Because of their isolation and geographical position, and in contrast to the multi-species tree canopies of tropical rain forests on the continents, the Hawaiian Islands have only two native dominant canopy species in their rain forests, Acacia koa and Metrosideros polymorpha. The wetter forest ecosystems are dominated by only the latter. In 1905, a dieback of lowland tropical Metrosideros rain forest was observed over a 35 km stretch on the lower east slope of Haleakala Mountain on Maui Island. This was dubbed 'The Maui Forest Trouble.' Although the synchronous decline of so many trees was initially believed to be caused by an epidemic disease, a decade of research yielded no pathogen. The conclusion was that the Hawaiian flora consisted primarily of colonizer species that were unable to continue growing on aging soils. Although this made ecological sense at that time, it was a rather limited and thereby unfortunate conclusion. Further research has shown that the Maui Forest Trouble was a 'bog-formation dieback', a process of vegetation dynamics not only related to soil aging but more broadly to geomorphic aging and fundamental landscape change. This process is clearly a marginal-site syndrome, but a natural process of profound consequence for biological conservation. This will be further explained as a paradigm for vegetation ecology.

TI  - Landscape-scale Variation in Pathogen-suppressive Bacteria in Tropical Dry Forest Soils of Costa Rica
T2  - BIOTROPICA
AB  - Bacteria in the genus Streptomyces are ubiquitous in soil and are well-known for their production of diverse secondary metabolites, including antibiotics that can inhibit soil-borne plant pathogens and suppress disease. Pathogen-suppressive soil bacteria have the potential to influence plant community composition and diversity, but remain relatively unexplored in tropical forest soils. To estimate the potential for disease suppression among Streptomyces communities in tropical dry forests, we cultured soil-borne Streptomyces from plots in two forests in northwestern Costa Rica (Santa Rosa and Palo Verde) and quantified antibiotic-mediated pathogen inhibition against three plant pathogens. The potential for pathogen inhibition and disease suppression by Streptomyces was highly variable across the landscape. Densities of pathogen-suppressive Streptomyces varied by over ten-fold and were correlated with soil nutrients across the plots. In particular, Streptomyces communities became more pathogen-suppressive as labile soil P decreased. Inhibitor densities were significantly higher in Santa Rosa than Palo Verde, which may be related to differences in soil texture and/or plant community composition between the two forests. Our findings suggest potential differences in the degree and specificity of antibiotic-mediated disease suppression in tropical dry forest soils of Costa Rica, and highlight the need for further studies on the drivers of pathogen-suppressive phenotypes as well as the consequences of spatially variable pathogen inhibition for plant community composition in tropical forest ecosystems.
   Resumen Las bacterias del genero Streptomyces son ubicuas en el suelo y son conocidas por su capacidad de producir diversos metabolitos secundarios. Estos incluyen antibioticos que pueden inhibir fitopatogenos del suelo y disminuir enfermedades. Las bacterias que suprimen el crecimiento de patogenos pueden influir en la composicion y la diversidad de comunidades de plantas, pero han sido poco estudiadas en suelos de bosques tropicales. Para estimar el potencial de supresion de enfermedades de diferentes comunidades de Streptomyces en el bosque tropical seco, cultivamos Streptomyces de muestras de suelo colectadas en parcelas en dos bosques en la region Noroeste de Costa Rica, y cuantificamos la frecuencia e intensidad de inhibicion de tres patogenos vegetales. El potencial de inhibicion de patogenos y supresion de enfermedad de Streptomyces fue muy variable entre sitios. Las densidades de Streptomyces supresoras de patogenos variaron mas de diez veces y se observo una correlacion entre la densidad de bacterias y la concentracion de nutrientes en el suelo de las parcelas. Especificamente, hubo mayor supresion de patogenos en suelos con bajas concentraciones de fosforo labil. Las densidades de inhibidores fueron significativamente mayores en Santa Rosa que en Palo Verde, lo que puede estar relacionado con las diferencias en la textura del suelo y/o diferencias en la composicion de las comunidades vegetales entre los dos sitios. Nuestros resultados sugieren que existen diferencias en el grado y la especificidad de la supresion de enfermedades mediada por antibioticos en suelos del bosque tropical seco de Costa Rica, y resaltan la necesidad de mas estudios acerca de los factores que influyen en la presencia de diferentes fenotipos supresores de patogenos, asi como las consecuencias de la variacion espacial de la inhibicion de patogenos para la composicion de las comunidades vegetales en ecosistemas de bosques tropicales.

TI  - El Nino drought and tropical forest conversion synergistically determine mosquito development rate
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - Extreme warming events can profoundly alter the transmission dynamics of mosquito-borne diseases by affecting mosquito life-history traits (e.g. survival, growth and reproduction). At local scales, temperatures are determined largely by vegetation structure and can be dramatically altered by drivers of land-use change (e.g. forest conversion). Disturbance activities can also hinder the buffering capacity of natural habitats, making them more susceptible to seasonal climate variation and extreme weather events (e.g. droughts). In experiments spanning three years, we investigated the interactive effects of tropical forest conversion and climate on fine-scale temperature, and the consequences for mosquito larval development. This study was conducted in the northern Malaysian Bornean state of Sabah using local Aedes albopictus mosquitoes; important vectors of dengue, chikungunya and Zika viruses. We demonstrate that variation in temperatures due to forest conversion dramatically increases development rates in Ae. albopictus mosquitoes. However, this effect was mediated by an El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) drought event. In normal years, mean temperatures did not differ between land-use types, however mosquitoes reared in oil palm plantations typically emerged 2-3 days faster than in logged forests. During an ENSO drought, mean temperatures did differ between land-use types, but surprisingly this did not result in different mosquito development rates. Driving this idiosyncratic response may be the differences in daily temperature fluctuations between the land-use types that either push mosquito larvae towards optimal development, or over the thermal optimum, thereby reducing fitness. This work highlights the importance of considering the synergistic effects of land-use and seasonal climate variations for predicting the thermal response of a key mosquito life-history trait driving disease transmission dynamics.

CP  - 23rd International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS 2003)
AB  - Twenty six texture measures (derived from local statistics, grey-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), sum and difference histogram (SADH) and varingrams) were calculated for simulated images and their ability to discriminate image texture independently of image contrast was determined. The seven texture measures able to discriminate texture independently of contrast (and therefore able to estimate biomass independently of backscatter) were entropy (derived from local statistics), contrast, entropy, correlation and chi-square (derived from the GLCM), mean of sum vector (derived from the SADA) and range (derived form the variogram). These measures were calculated for Japanese Earth Resources Satellite (JERS-1) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images and related to the biomass of regenerating forest and mature forest plots from two study areas in Brazilian Amazonia. It was hypothesised that texture (a measure of both biomass and canopy unevenness) could be related to tropical forest biomass up to and beyond the saturation of the backscatter/biomass relationship. The results showed that only GLCM derived contrast increased the correlation between backscatter and biomass. The combination of GLCM contrast with backscatter has the potential to increase the accuracy of biomass estimation over the use of backscatter alone.

AB  - The Swiss Development Cooperation, Canada's International Development Research Centre, the Swiss Tropical Public Health Institute, and the UNICEF/United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)/World Bank/World Health Organization (WHO) Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR) collaborated on a project to review, understand and promote the use of multisectoral approaches (MSAs) in the prevention and control of vector-borne diseases (VBDs). The objectives of the project were to support a landscape analysis of how MSAs have been used in the prevention and control of VBDs; to develop a theoretical framework for guiding the implementation of interventions; and to test the recommendations in real-life conditions. To realize these objectives, the project supported several activities, including commissioning a series of scientific reviews on MSAs in 5 thematic areas, sharing the key findings of these reviews in workshops and events, and developing a guidance framework for the implementation of MSAs. These activities have produced the theoretical framework that will be tested in real-life conditions through the support of case studies. The collaboration on implementing multisectoral activities against VBDs will continue among TDR, the Swiss Tropical Public Health Institute, and new partners such as the WHO Water Sanitation and Hygiene Group, UNDP, and UN-Habitat, in order to face the challenges identified and propose solutions tailored to specific contexts. The prevention and control of VBDs require strong and adapted MSAs with the full participation of all relevant sectors.

TI  - YEASTS ASSOCIATED WITH DROSOPHILA IN TROPICAL FORESTS OF RIO-DE-JANEIRO, BRAZIL
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - The distribution and diversity of yeast species vectored by and from the crop of eight species groups of Drosophila is described for two rain forest sites and an urban wooded area in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The typical forest Drosophila groups guarani, tripunctata, and willistoni showed a higher diversity of yeasts than the cosmopolitan melanogaster species group, suggesting different strategies of utilization of substrates. Apiculate yeasts, including Kloeckera apis, Kloeckera javanica, and Kloeckera japonica, were the prevalent species. Geotrichum spp. and Candida citrea were also frequent isolates in the forest sites. Similarities between the yeasts from the external surfaces and crops of Drosophila suggested that the feeding substrates were the main source of the yeasts vectored by these flies. Most of the yeasts were strong fermenters and assimilated few compounds, usually sucrose, cellobiose, and glycerol. This indicated a preference of the flies for food sources such as fruits. Some yeasts were primarily isolated from one group of Drosophila; for example, Kloeckera javanica from the melanogaster group, Debaryomyces vanrijiae var. yarrowii from the tripunctata group, and Kluyveromyces delphensis from the willistoni group. These associations and differences in the yeast communities among the fly groups suggested a differentiation of diets and specialization of the yeast-Drosophila association in the tropical forests.

T2  - DECADE OF TRANS-EUROPEAN REMOTE SENSING COOPERATION
CP  - 20th Annual Symposium of the European-Association-of-Remote-Sensing-Laboratories (EARSeL)
AB  - Land use and land cover change is presently a topic of wide concern, as it is one reason behind global climate change. Tropical forest cover change is now highly concentrated as a research and political issue. The current study focuses on the evaluation of tropical deforestation during the past decades in southern Chittagong, Bangladesh using Landsat Landsat TM data of 1990 and 1997. The gee-coded imagery is visually interpreted. The classification scheme follows the definition given by the TREES II project. Aerial photographs, vegetation maps, ground inventory support the interpretation process. Digitizing the interpretation result creates the vector polygon layers. Overlay the vector layers determines the changes of forest cover during 1990-1997. The result is quite useful to detect and predict the patterns of tropical forest cover change in a densely populated environment and contributes to understand the global climate change.

CP  - 5th International Symposium on Multispectral Image Processing and Pattern Recognition
AB  - The tropical forest change of Xishaungbanna in P.R. of China was studied here, which includes several steps. Firstly, The LANDSAT TM images acquired respectively on March 26, 1987, February 10, 1997, and March 6, 2000 were geometrically corrected, matched, and radiantly corrected. Secondly, the Normal Different Vegetation Index (NDVI) was formulated for the three periods. Thirdly, the false color composition images were achieved respectively for the three periods, which were used for visually interpreting forest and non-forest. Fourthly, the forest areas of the three periods were extracted semi-automatically from NDVI of the three periods by their suitable threshold. Fifthly, the forest areas of the three periods were changed into vector form. Sixthly, the extracted forest area of the three periods in vector form superposes their false color composition images for evaluating their accuracies. Finally, the map of forest change among the three periods was made, and the forest change area was calculated. The research shows: The decreased tropical forest area between 1987 and 1997 is 234558 hectares, accounted for 19 percent of the tropical forest area in 1987. The decreased tropical forest area between 1997 and 2000 is 41237 hectares, accounted for 4.2 percent of the tropical forest area in 1997.

TI  - A Review of Zoonotic Infection Risks Associated with the Wild Meat Trade in Malaysia
T2  - ECOHEALTH
AB  - The overhunting of wildlife for food and commercial gain presents a major threat to biodiversity in tropical forests and poses health risks to humans from contact with wild animals. Using a recent survey of wildlife offered at wild meat markets in Malaysia as a basis, we review the literature to determine the potential zoonotic infection risks from hunting, butchering and consuming the species offered. We also determine which taxa potentially host the highest number of pathogens and discuss the significant disease risks from traded wildlife, considering how cultural practices influence zoonotic transmission. We identify 51 zoonotic pathogens (16 viruses, 19 bacteria and 16 parasites) potentially hosted by wildlife and describe the human health risks. The Suidae and the Cervidae families potentially host the highest number of pathogens. We conclude that there are substantial gaps in our knowledge of zoonotic pathogens and recommend performing microbial food safety risk assessments to assess the hazards of wild meat consumption. Overall, there may be considerable zoonotic risks to people involved in the hunting, butchering or consumption of wild meat in Southeast Asia, and these should be considered in public health strategies.

TI  - Discrimination of tropical forest types, dominant species, and mapping of functional guilds by hyperspectral and simulated multispectral Sentinel-2 data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
AB  - To answer new scientific and ecological questions and monitor multiple forest changes, a fine scale characterization of these ecosystems is needed, and could imply the mapping of specific species, of detailed forest types, and of functional composition. This characterization can be now provided by the novel Earth Observation tools. This study aims to contribute to understanding the innovation in forest and ecological research that can be brought in by advanced remote sensing instruments, and proposes the guild mapping approach as a tool to efficiently monitor the varied tropical forest resources. We evaluated, in tropical Ghanaian forests, the ability of airborne hyperspectral and simulated multispectral Sentinel-2 data, and derived vegetation indices and textures, to: distinguish between two different forest types; to discriminate among selected dominant species; and to separate trees species grouped according to their functional guilds: Pioneer, Non Pioneer Light Demanding, and Shade Bearer. We then produced guild classification maps for each area using hyperspectral data. Our results showed that with both hyperspectral and simulated Sentinel-2 data these discrimination tasks can be successfully accomplished. Results also stressed the importance of texture features, especially if using the lower spectral and spatial Sentinel-2 resolution data, and highlighted the important role of the new Sentinel-2 data for ecological monitoring. Classification results showed a statistically significant improvement in overall accuracy using Support Vector Machine, over Maximum Likelihood approach. We proposed the functional guilds mapping as an innovative approach to: (i) monitor compositional changes, especially with respect to the effects of global climate change on forests, and particularly in the tropical biome where the occurrence of hundreds of species prevents mapping activities at species level; (ii) support large-scale forest inventories. The imminent Sentinel-2 data could serve to open the road for the development of new concepts and methods in forestry and ecological research. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Mapping infectious disease landscapes: unmanned aerial vehicles and epidemiology
T2  - TRENDS IN PARASITOLOGY
AB  - The potential applications of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), or drones, have generated intense interest across many fields. UAVs offer the potential to collect detailed spatial information in real time at relatively low cost and are being used increasingly in conservation and ecological research. Within infectious disease epidemiology and public health research, UAVs can provide spatially and temporally accurate data critical to understanding the linkages between disease transmission and environmental factors. Using UAVs avoids many of the limitations associated with satellite data (e.g., long repeat times, cloud contamination, low spatial resolution). However, the practicalities of using UAVs for field research limit their use to specific applications and settings. UAVs fill a niche but do not replace existing remote-sensing methods.

TI  - Long-term erosion of tree reproductive trait diversity in edge-dominated Atlantic forest fragments
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Habitat loss and fragmentation promote relatively predicable shifts in the functional signature of tropical forest tree assemblages, but the full extent of cascading effects to biodiversity persistence remains poorly understood. Here we test the hypotheses that habitat fragmentation (a) alters the relative contribution of tree species exhibiting different reproductive traits; (b) reduces the diversity of pollination systems: and (c) facilitates the functional convergence of reproductive traits between edge-affected and early-secondary forest habitats (5-32 years old). This study was carried out in a severely fragmented 670-km(2) forest landscape of the Atlantic forest of northeastern Brazil. We assigned 35 categories of reproductive traits to 3552 trees (DBH >= 10 cm) belonging to 179 species, which described their pollination system, floral biology, and sexual system. Trait abundance was calculated for 55 plots of 0.1 ha across four habitats: forest edges, small forest fragments (3.4-83.6 ha). second-growth patches, and core tracts of forest interior within the largest available primary forest fragment (3500 ha) in the region. Edge-affected and secondary habitats showed a species-poor assemblage of trees exhibiting particular pollination systems, a reduced diversity of pollination systems, a higher abundance of reproductive traits associated with pollination by generalist diurnal vectors, and an elevated abundance of hermaphroditic trees. As expected, the reproductive signature of tree assemblages in forest edges and small fragments (edge-affected habitats), which was very similar to that of early second-growth patches, was greatly affected by both habitat type and plot distance to the nearest forest edge. In hyper-fragmented Atlantic forest landscapes, we predict that narrow forest corridors and small fragments will become increasingly dominated by edge-affected habitats that can no longer retain the full complement of tree life-history diversity and its attendant mutualists.

TI  - Effect of spatial scale and latitude on diversity-disease relationships
T2  - ECOLOGY
AB  - Natural ecosystems provide humans with different types of ecosystem services, often linked to biodiversity. The dilution effect (DE) predicts a negative relationship between biodiversity and risk of infectious diseases of humans, other animals, and plants. We hypothesized that a stronger DE would be observed in studies conducted at smaller spatial scales, where biotic drivers may predominate, compared to studies at larger spatial scales where abiotic drivers may more strongly affect disease patterns. In addition, we hypothesized a stronger DE in studies from temperate regions at mid latitudes than in those from subtropical and tropical regions, due to more diffuse species interactions at low latitudes. To explore these hypotheses, we conducted a meta-analysis of observational studies of diversity-disease relationships for animals across spatial scales and geographic regions. Negative diversity-disease relationships were significant at small (combined site and local), intermediate (combined landscape and regional), and large (combined continental and global) scales and the effect did not differ depending on size of the study areas. For the geographic region analysis, a strongly negative diversity-disease relationship was found in the temperate region while no effect was found in the subtropical and tropical regions. However, no overall effect of absolute latitude on the strength of the dilution effect was detected. Our results suggest that a negative diversity-disease relationship occurs across scales and latitudes and is especially strong in the temperate region. These findings may help guide future management efforts in lowering disease risk.

TI  - Native bees mediate long-distance pollen dispersal in a shade coffee landscape mosaic
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
AB  - Coffee farms are often embedded within a mosaic of agriculture and forest fragments in the world's most biologically diverse tropical regions. Although shade coffee farms can potentially support native pollinator communities, the degree to which these pollinators facilitate gene flow for native trees is unknown. We examined the role of native bees as vectors of gene flow for a reproductively specialized native tree, Miconia affinis, in a shade coffee and remnant forest landscape mosaic. We demonstrate extensive cross-habitat gene flow by native bees, with pollination events spanning more than 1,800 m. Pollen was carried twice as far within shade coffee habitat as in nearby forest, and trees growing within shade coffee farms received pollen from a far greater number of sires than trees within remnant forest. The study shows that shade coffee habitats support specialized native pollinators that enhance the fecundity and genetic diversity of remnant native trees.

T2  - 2014 IEEE INTERNATIONAL GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING SYMPOSIUM (IGARSS)
CP  - IEEE Joint International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS) / 35th Canadian Symposium on Remote Sensing
AB  - This study aims to evaluate the contribution of textural analysis from high spatial resolution TerraSAR-X images for tropical forests mapping.
   This study evaluates the potential of the High resolution Spotlight TerraSAR-X image (HS), with a spatial resolution of 0.6 meter in Range and 1.1 meter in Azimuth, for the classification of tropical forest plantation of native species. Indeed, the contribution of the analysis of textural information for classification has been emphasized through the analysis of Haralick textural parameters, a second order statistic parameters computed in a certain direction with a distance (d) and window size (w). The retained algorithm of classification is SVM (Support Vector Machine as it allows taking into account numerous parameters, which can be heterogeneous with respect to their physical dimension. To resolve the issue of class heterogeneity in the context of high resolution image, a post classification has been applied by the mean of a majority filter. In this case, the majority filter was weighted by integrating a shape of different plots containing the label of the tree planted species.

TI  - Mosquito community composition in dynamic landscapes from the Atlantic Forest biome (Diptera, Culicidae)
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ENTOMOLOGIA
AB  - Mosquito community composition in dynamic landscapes from the Atlantic Forest biome (Diptera, Culicidae). Considering that some species of Culicidae are vectors of pathogens, both the knowledge of the diversity of the mosquito fauna and how some environment factors influence in it, are important subjects. In order to address the composition of Culicidae species in a forest reserve in southern Atlantic Forest, we compared biotic and abiotic environmental determinants and how they were associated with the occurrence of species between sunset and sunrise. The level of conservation of the area was also considered. The investigation was carried out at Reserva Natural do Morro da Mina, in Antonina, state of Parana, Brazil. We performed sixteen mosquito collections employing Shannon traps at three-hour intervals, from July 2008 to June 2009. The characterization of the area was determined using ecological indices of diversity, evenness, dominance and similarity. We compared the frequency of specimens with abiotic variables, i.e., temperature, relative humidity and pluviosity. Seven thousand four hundred ten mosquito females were captured. They belong to 48 species of 12 genera. The most abundant genera were Anopheles, Culex, Coquillettidia, Aedes and Runchomyia. Among the species, the most abundant was Anopheles cruzii, the primary vector of Plasmodium spp. in the Atlantic Forest. Results of the analyses showed that the abiotic variables we tested did not influence the occurrence of species, although certain values suggested that there was an optimum range for the occurrence of culicid species. It was possible to detect the presence of species of Culicidae with different epidemiologic profiles and habitat preference.

TI  - Change Detection of Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon Using Landsat Data and Convolutional Neural Networks
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Mapping deforestation is an essential step in the process of managing tropical rainforests. It lets us understand and monitor both legal and illegal deforestation and its implications, which include the effect deforestation may have on climate change through greenhouse gas emissions. Given that there is ample room for improvements when it comes to mapping deforestation using satellite imagery, in this study, we aimed to test and evaluate the use of algorithms belonging to the growing field of deep learning (DL), particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to this end. Although studies have been using DL algorithms for a variety of remote sensing tasks for the past few years, they are still relatively unexplored for deforestation mapping. We attempted to map the deforestation between images approximately one year apart, specifically between 2017 and 2018 and between 2018 and 2019. Three CNN architectures that are available in the literature-SharpMask, U-Net, and ResUnet-were used to classify the change between years and were then compared to two classic machine learning (ML) algorithms-random forest (RF) and multilayer perceptron (MLP)-as points of reference. After validation, we found that the DL models were better in most performance metrics including the Kappa index, F1 score, and mean intersection over union (mIoU) measure, while the ResUnet model achieved the best overall results with a value of 0.94 in all three measures in both time sequences. Visually, the DL models also provided classifications with better defined deforestation patches and did not need any sort of post-processing to remove noise, unlike the ML models, which needed some noise removal to improve results.

TI  - Two Decades Progress on the Application of Remote Sensing for Monitoring Tropical and Sub-Tropical Natural Forests: A Review
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Forest covers about a third of terrestrial land surface, with tropical and subtropical zones being a major part. Remote sensing applications constitute a significant approach to monitoring forests. Thus, this paper reviews the progress made by remote sensing data applications to tropical and sub-tropical natural forest monitoring over the last two decades (2000-2020). The review focuses on the thematic areas of aboveground biomass and carbon estimations, tree species identification, tree species diversity, and forest cover and change mapping. A systematic search of articles was performed on Web of Science, Science Direct, and Google Scholar by applying a Boolean operator and using keywords related to the thematic areas. We identified 50 peer-reviewed articles that studied tropical and subtropical natural forests using remote sensing data. Asian and South American natural forests are the most highly researched natural forests, while African natural forests are the least studied. Medium spatial resolution imagery was extensively utilized for forest cover and change mapping as well as aboveground biomass and carbon estimation. In the latest studies, high spatial resolution imagery and machine learning algorithms, such as Random Forest and Support Vector Machine, were jointly utilized for tree species identification. In this review, we noted the promising potential of the emerging high spatial resolution satellite imagery for the monitoring of natural forests. We recommend more research to identify approaches to overcome the challenges of remote sensing applications to these thematic areas so that further and sustainable progress can be made to effectively monitor and manage sustainable forest benefits.

TI  - Comparison of malaria incidence rates and socioeconomic-environmental factors between the states of Acre and Rondonia: a spatio-temporal modelling study
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
AB  - Background Plasmodium falciparum malaria is a threat to public health, but Plasmodium vivax malaria is most prevalent in Latin America, where the incidence rate has been increasing since 2016, particularly in Venezuela and Brazil. The Brazilian Amazon reported 193,000 cases in 2017, which were mostly confirmed as P. vivax (similar to 90%). Herein, the relationships among malaria incidence rates and the proportion of accumulated deforestation were contrasted using data from the states of Acre and Rondonia in the south-western Brazilian Amazon. The main purpose is to test the hypothesis that the observed difference in incidence rates is associated with the proportion of accumulated deforestation. Methods An ecological study using spatial and temporal models for mapping and modelling malaria risk was performed. The municipalities of Acre and Rondonia were the spatial units of analysis, whereas month and year were the temporal units. The number of reported malaria cases from 2009 until 2015 were used to calculate the incidence rate per 1000 people at risk. Accumulated deforestation was calculated using publicly available satellite images. Geographically weighted regression was applied to provide a local model of the spatial heterogeneity of incidence rates. Time-series dynamic regression was applied to test the correlation of incidence rates and accumulated deforestation, adjusted by climate and socioeconomic factors. Results The malaria incidence rate declined in Rondonia but remained stable in Acre. There was a high and positive correlation between the decline in malaria and higher proportions of accumulated deforestation in Rondonia. Geographically weighted regression showed a complex relationship. As deforestation increased, malaria incidence also increased in Acre, while as deforestation increased, malaria incidence decreased in Rondonia. Time-series dynamic regression showed a positive association between malaria incidence and precipitation and accumulated deforestation, whereas the association was negative with the human development index in the westernmost areas of Acre. Conclusion Landscape modification caused by accumulated deforestation is an important driver of malaria incidence in the Brazilian Amazon. However, this relationship is not linearly correlated because it depends on the overall proportion of the land covered by forest. For regions that are partially degraded, forest cover becomes a less representative component in the landscape, causing the abovementioned non-linear relationship. In such a scenario, accumulated deforestation can lead to a decline in malaria incidence.

TI  - Rubber's inclusion in zero-deforestation legislation is necessary but not sufficient to reduce impacts on biodiversity
T2  - CONSERVATION LETTERS
AB  - Agricultural commodity production is a major driver of tropical deforestation and biodiversity loss. Natural rubber from Hevea brasiliensis, a valuable commodity without viable substitutes, has recently been included in the European Union (EU) deforestation regulation that aims to halt imports of goods containing embedded deforestation. Sustained growth in demand for rubber is driven by increasing tire production, caused by rising transport flows and personal car ownership. We show that average natural rubber yields remain static, meaning 2.7-5.3 million ha of additional plantations could be needed by 2030 to meet demand. A systematic literature search identified 106 case studies concerning transitions to and from rubber, revealing that substantial rubber plantation area expansion since 2010 has occurred at the expense of natural forest. Eliminating deforestation from rubber supply chains requires support for millions of smallholder growers to maintain or increase production from existing plantations, without land or water degradation. Supply chain traceability efforts offer opportunities to deliver such support. While the inclusion of rubber in EU legislation is a positive step, it is critical to ensure that smallholders are not marginalized to avoid exacerbating poverty, and that other markets follow suit to avoid displacement of rubber-driven deforestation to unregulated markets.

TI  - DETER-R: An Operational Near-Real Time Tropical Forest Disturbance Warning System Based on Sentinel-1 Time Series Analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Continuous monitoring of forest disturbance on tropical forests is a fundamental tool to support proactive preservation actions and to stop further destruction of native vegetation. Currently most of the monitoring systems in operation are based on optical imagery, and thus are flaw-prone on areas with frequent cloud cover. As this, several Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)-based systems have been developed recently, aiming all-weather disturbance detection. This article presents the main aspects and the results of the first year of operation of the SAR based Near Real-Time Deforestation Detection System (DETER-R), an automated deforestation detection system focused on the Brazilian Amazon. DETER-R uses the Google Earth Engine platform to preprocess and analyze Sentinel-1 SAR time series. New images are treated and analyzed daily. After the automated analysis, the system vectorizes clusters of deforested pixels and sends the corresponding polygons to the environmental enforcement agency. After 12 months of operational life, the system has produced 88,572 forest disturbance warnings. Human validation of the warning polygons showed a extremely low rate of misdetections, with less than 0.2% of the detected area corresponding to false positives. During the first year of operation, DETER-R provided 33,234 warnings of interest to national monitoring agencies which were not detected by its optical counterpart DETER in the same period, corresponding to an area of 105,238.5 ha, or approximately 5% of the total detections. During the rainy season, the rate of additional detections increased as expected, reaching 8.1%.

TI  - Combination of SAR Polarimetric Parameters for Estimating Tropical Forest Aboveground Biomass
T2  - POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
AB  - There is a demand for better information on forest biomass in tropical regions for use in carbon accounting. This needs robust above-ground biomass (AGB) estimation in different forest types. Our study sought to improve biomass estimation by selecting the best regression models based on observations of the contribution of radar signals to AGB in five forest types in Vietnam. Data from PALSAR and PALSAR-2, which covered the forest area, were used to extract 16 polarimetric radar (PolSAR) parameters in 2007 and 2016. This study was designed as a comparative experiment of four regression models: linear, polynomial, support vector machine (SVR) and random forest. First, the contribution of PolSAR data to AGB estimation was evaluated using two approaches: the sample data from all forest types, and the five individual forest types (rich, medium, poor, restoration and bamboo forest). Second, we examined the improvement of AGB prediction by selecting the important variables and assessing the best models for different forest types. The results showed an improvement in the value of R-squared and RMSE using the five individual forest types compared to the combined forest types. In particular, using a multivariate model, RMSE values were enhanced by 9-18% for the rich forest, and by 80-85% for the remaining forest types in all models. SVM provided the best performance for medium and poor forest (RMSE of 8.27 tons ha(-1) and 12.38 tons ha(-1,) respectively), random forest for bamboo (RMSE of 23.18 tons ha(-1)), and the polynomial regression for the restoration forest (RMSE of 10.11 tons ha(-1)). Further research is required to derive a more robust AGB estimation model for the rich forest.

TI  - Configurational changes of patchy landscapes dynamics
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
AB  - This paper introduces dynamic configurational changes for patchy mosaics, parameterizable dilation and/or erosion processes of units in a vectorial landscape. Patchy-based models are rare although this conceptual framework could yield insights to the functioning and dynamics of agricultural and natural landscapes. Compared to common raster-based models, they are more parsimonious and intuitive, but their algorithmic computations are challenging. The aim of this study is to implement polygon dilation throughout Minkowski sum on polygons, along with their associated formal grammar, in the DYPAL modeling platform. This computation is a challenging open-problem and this paper provides a first working approach along with the methodology for a generic implementation framework. As an example, this paper illustrates configurational changes on a complex forest-savannah dynamics in a tropical biodiversity hotspot, New Caledonia. Finally, perspectives for configurational changes in landscape modeling are discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - The Ecology and Natural History of Foliar Bacteria with a Focus on Tropical Forests and Agroecosystems
T2  - BOTANICAL REVIEW
AB  - Leaves of higher plants comprise perhaps the largest bacterial substrate on earth, yet we know very little about the bacteria that occupy these spaces. In this review, we first examine the ecology and behavior of bacteria that reside on leaf surfaces. Next, we discuss the ecological implications of foliar bacteria that reside in interior portions of leaf tissues. Later, we consider the studies on foliar bacteria in tropical habitats to date. Finally, we examine evidence regarding the potential roles of foliar bacteria in structuring tropical plant communities. Bacteria colonize the phyllosphere via animal vectors or passively from soil, wind, or rain, though there are too few data to determine the relative contributions of these sources to the phyllosphere. Additionally, the degree to which parent plants transmit bacteria to offspring via seed remains unknown. We predict that high temperature, high humidity, low UV radiation, and leaf architecture in the tropical understory enable tropical leaves to support more abundant and diverse bacterial communities compared to temperate leaves. While the extent of competitive interactions among bacteria remains poorly resolved, evidence from agricultural crop species and Arabidopsis thaliana suggests that these interactions cause niche partitioning based on carbon use. The degree to which phyllobacteria and endophytes of tropical plants are pathogenic versus mutualistic or neutral remains unexplored. We hypothesize, however, that the detrimental impact of bacterial pathogens ultimately increases as the abundance of single host tree species increases, which can promote and maintain plant diversity in tropical forests.

TI  - Effects of landscape composition on bee communities and coffee pollination in <i>Coffea arabica</i> production forests in southwestern Ethiopia
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Agricultural expansion and intensification threaten pollinator populations worldwide, potentially jeopardizing crop pollination. Although the highest rates of cropland expansion are currently found within the tropics, quantifying effects of landscape composition on tropical pollinator communities and the provided pollination services to crops has received relatively limited attention. Here, we studied the relationship between land use in the landscape matrix surrounding Ethiopian coffee production forests and their bee communities and coffee pollination services. We used pan traps to collect bees from 20 plots located in small-scale coffee (Coffea arabica) production forests of varying size in a major Arabica coffee production zone in southwestern Ethiopia. To estimate the provided coffee pollination services, we performed pollinator exclusion experiments and calculated yield stability across three years. We collected 595 bees belonging to 27 species, with the honeybee (Apis mellifera) as dominant species. We found a significant convex parabolic relationship between the non-Apis bee diversity within coffee production forests and the proportion of open agricultural land in the surrounding landscape. Pollinator exclusion resulted in a significantly lower initial, but not final, fruit set. Whereas initial fruit set was not affected by the composition of the bee community, our results indicated a positive relation between non-Apis bee diversity and temporal coffee yield stability. High proportions of fruit drop suggested that physiological stress factors may have abrogated the potential benefits of insect pollination in the final fruit set. We conclude that the agricultural land and homesteads surrounding the coffee production forests still support sufficient nesting and feeding resources for non-Apis bees, hence providing a source of potential coffee pollinators. Increasing human population in the region and the increasing demand for food may present future challenges to reconcile the required increased agricultural production with the conservation of pollinator species and pollination services.

TI  - The road to recovery: a synthesis of outcomes from ecosystem restoration in tropical and sub-tropical Asian forests
T2  - PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB  - Current policy is driving renewed impetus to restore forests to return ecological function, protect species, sequester carbon and secure livelihoods. Here we assess the contribution of tree planting to ecosystem restoration in tropical and sub-tropical Asia; we synthesize evidence on mortality and growth of planted trees at 176 sites and assess structural and biodiversity recovery of co-located actively restored and naturally regenerating forest plots. Mean mortality of planted trees was 18% 1 year after planting, increasing to 44% after 5 years. Mortality varied strongly by site and was typically ca 20% higher in open areas than degraded forest, with height at planting positively affecting survival. Size-standardized growth rates were negatively related to species-level wood density in degraded forest and plantations enrichment settings. Based on community-level data from 11 landscapes, active restoration resulted in faster accumulation of tree basal area and structural properties were closer to old-growth reference sites, relative to natural regeneration, but tree species richness did not differ. High variability in outcomes across sites indicates that planting for restoration is potentially rewarding but risky and context-dependent. Restoration projects must prepare for and manage commonly occurring challenges and align with efforts to protect and reconnect remaining forest areas.The abstract of this article is available in Bahasa Indonesia in the electronic supplementary material.This article is part of the theme issue 'Understanding forest landscape restoration: reinforcing scientific foundations for the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration'.

TI  - Response of Understory Bird Feeding Groups to Deforestation Gradient in a Tropical Rainforest of Cameroon
T2  - TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE
AB  - Birds are crucial in maintaining the balance of many ecosystems and provide various ecological services. Understanding their sensitivity to human disturbances should be prioritized in understudy areas for effective conservation practices. Using mist nets, this study characterized mostly understory bird communities (insectivorous, frugivorous, granivorous, and nectarivorous birds) in three habitat types (pristine forest, selectively logged forest, and young oil palm plantation) in the Talangaye rainforest, Southwest Cameroon. A total of 845 birds belonging to 27 families and 85 species were recorded in the three habitats after 294 h of mist netting. Overall, the mist-netted community was largely dominated by insectivores, followed by frugivores, nectarivores, granivores, and carnivores. Although mean species richness, abundance, and Simpson diversity index did not vary significantly among habitat types, mean species abundance and diversity index decreased in selectively logged forest and young oil palm plantation and species richness increased in both habitats. The species richness, abundance, and diversity index for insectivorous and frugivorous birds were lowest in the young oil palm plantations. For granivores, species richness and abundance increased following selective logging and the establishment of oil palm plantation. The highest mean species richness and diversity index in nectarivores were recorded in the young oil palm plantations. The study showed that selective logging and establishment of oil palm plantation had variable effects on the bird communities in the Talangaye rainforest. Also, the frugivorous birds appeared to be more sensitive to both types of disturbances, while the insectivores were more sensitive to habitat loss/conversion.

TI  - Epidemiological considerations of rodent community composition in fragmented landscapes in Panama
T2  - JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY
AB  - We predicted that more-fragmented habitats are associated with lower diversity of small mammals and higher densities of populations of rodents that are hosts of hantaviruses. We compared diversity and distribution of small mammals that are either hosts or nonhosts of hantaviruses in 6 Panamanian national parks and adjacent areas with varying degree of human impacts. We sampled forest, edge, and anthropogenically disturbed habitats. The generalist rodents Oligoryzomys fulvescens (reservoir of Choclo virus) and Zygodontomys brevicauda (reservoir of Calabazo virus) were more abundant in disturbed habitats, especially in smaller and more isolated patches, where population density and diversity of other rodent species was lowest. In contrast, these 2 species had lower abundances in larger forested areas with more nonreservoir species of small mammals. Our results suggest that the change in the natural environment resulting from tropical deforestation is increasing the abundance and distribution of species that are reservoirs for hantaviruses. Therefore, it is likely that forest fragmentation has contributed to recent outbreaks of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in tropical areas. Conservation of natural resources becomes all the more imperative, not only for protecting fauna and flora but also for human health.

TI  - Mixed tropical forests canopy height mapping from spaceborne LiDAR GEDI and multisensor imagery using machine learning models
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Spatial mapping of forests canopy height (Hcanopy) provides an opportunity to assess above-ground biomass, net primary productivity, carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration, biodiversity conservation and forest fire risks. This study incorporated a continuous coverage of multi-spectral optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) along with sparsely global ecosystem dynamics investigation (GEDI) spaceborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data in the machine learning (ML) models for mapping Hcanopy in the mixed tropical forests of Shoolpaneshwar wildlife sanctuary (SWLS), Gujarat, India. We trained seven ML models, including quantile random forest (QRF), support vector machine (SVM), Bayesian regularization for feed-forward neural networks (BRNN), conditional inference random forest (Cforest), Extreme gradient boosting (Xgbtree), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) using GEDI_02A extracted Hcanopy as training data. We used predictors which were extracted from LiDAR (GEDI metrics), multispectral optical (Landsat-8, Sentinel-2), and SAR (ALOS-2/PALSAR-2, Sentinel-1). A 10-fold cross-validation (CV) resampling was used to avoid overfitting or underfitting. The comparison of the models performances shows that the BRNN model has the highest satisfactory accuracy metrics, such as root mean square error (RMSE) of 4.686 m, R-squared (R-2) of 0.49 and mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.66 m. Low training samples of tall canopies (> 25 m), presence of mixed vegetation, geometric and structural variability and sloppy terrain of SWLS possibly restricted models from performing well. Field validation shows an R(2 )of 0.55, satisfactory for mixed tropical forests using spaceborne LiDAR. The present work provides insights into using spaceborne LiDAR GEDI data with optical and SAR data for Hcanopy mapping through ML models, which help to manage SWLS and further implications of forest Hcanopy mapping over large spatial scales.

TI  - Changing gears during succession: shifting functional strategies in young tropical secondary forests
T2  - OECOLOGIA
AB  - Adaptations to resource availability strongly shape patterns of community composition along successional gradients in environmental conditions. In the present study, we examined the extent to which variation in functional composition explains shifts in trait-based functional strategies in young tropical secondary forests during the most dynamic stage of succession (0-20 years). Functional composition of two size classes in 51 secondary forest plots was determined using community-weighted means of seven functional traits, which were intensively measured on 55 woody plant species (n = 875-1,761 individuals). Along the successional gradient in forest structure, there was a significant and consistent shift in functional strategies from resource acquisition to resource conservation. Leaf toughness and adult plant size increased significantly, while net photosynthetic capacity (A (mass)) decreased significantly during succession. Shifts in functional strategies within size classes for A (mass) and wood density also support the hypothesis that changes in functional composition are shaped by environmental conditions along successional gradients. In general, 'hard' functional traits, e.g., A (mass) and leaf toughness, linked to different facets of plant performance exhibited greater sensitivity to successional changes in forest structure than 'soft' traits, such as leaf mass area and leaf dry matter content. Our results also suggested that stochastic processes related to previous land-use history, dispersal limitation, and abiotic factors explained variation in functional composition beyond that attributed to deterministic shifts in functional strategies. Further data on seed dispersal vectors and distance and landscape configuration are needed to improve current mechanistic models of succession in tropical secondary forests.

TI  - Association of Anthropogenic Land Use Change and Increased Abundance of the Chagas Disease Vector <i>Rhodnius pallescens</i> in a Rural Landscape of Panama
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Anthropogenic disturbance is associated with increased vector borne infectious disease transmission in wildlife, domestic animals, and humans The objective of this study was to evaluate how disturbance of a tropical forest landscape impacts abundance of the triatomine bug Rhodnuis pallescens, a vector of Chagas disease, in the region of the Panama Canal in Panama Rhodnius pallescens was collected (n = 1,186) from its primary habitat, the palm Attalea butyracea in five habitat types reflecting a gradient of anthropogenic disturbance There was a high proportion of palms infested with R pallescens across all habitat types (range = 77 1-91 4%) Results show that disturbed habitats are associated with increased vector abundance compared with relatively undisturbed habitats Bugs collected in disturbed sites, although in higher abundance tended to be in poor body condition compared with bugs captured in protected forest sites Abundance data suggests that forest remnants may be sources for R pallescens populations within highly disturbed areas of the landscape

TI  - Emerging and threatening vector-borne zoonoses in the world and in Europe: a brief update
T2  - PATHOGENS AND GLOBAL HEALTH
AB  - Climatic changes, landscape management, massive human, animal and commodity transportation represent important factors which are contributing to the spread of zoonotic diseases. The environmental and socioeconomic factors affecting the incidence of vector-borne zoonoses and possibilities for the reduction of disease impacts are discussed in the article. The most important zoonoses with expanding area of incidence and/or increasing occurrence are summarized, with special emphasis on the European region. While some diseases and their respective pathogens are indigenous to Europe (e.g. Lyme disease), others have been introduced to Europe from tropical areas (e.g. chikungunya or dengue fever). These emerging diseases may represent a serious threat in near future and better understanding of their spreading mechanisms, pathogenesis and consequent treatment is very important.

TI  - A descriptive study of zoonotic disease risk at the human-wildlife interface in a biodiversity hot spot in South Western Uganda
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Zoonotic diseases pose a significant health challenge at the human-wildlife interface, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa where ecosystem services contribute significantly to local livelihoods and individual well-being. In Uganda, the fragmented forests of Hoima district, form part of a "biodiversity and emerging infectious disease hotspot" composed of communities with high dependency on this wildlife protected areas, unaware of the associated health risks. We conducted a cross-sectional mixed methods study from March to May 2017 and interviewed 370 respondents, using a semi-structured questionnaire from eight villages neighbouring forest fragments in Hoima District, Uganda. Additionally, a total of ten (10) focus group discussions (FGDs) consisting of 6-10 men or women were conducted to further explore the drivers of hunting and perception of zoonotic disease risks at community level. Qualitative and quantitative data were analysed using content analysis and STATA version 12 respectively. We found twenty-nine percent (29.0%, CI: 24.4-33.9) of respondents were engaged in hunting of wildlife such as chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) and 45.8% (CI: 40.6-51.0), cane rats (Thryonomyidae spp). Acquisition of animal protein was among the main reasons why communities hunt (55.3%, CI: 50.1-60.4), followed by "cultural" and "medicinal" uses of wildlife and or its parts (22.7%, CI: 18.6-27.4). Results further revealed that hunting and bushmeat consumption is persistent for other perceived reasons like; bushmeat strengthens the body, helps mothers recover faster after delivery, boosts one's immunity and hunting is exercise for the body. However, respondents reported falling sick after consumption of bushmeat at least once (7.9%, CI: 5.3-11.1), with 5.3% (CI: 2.60-9.60) reporting similar symptoms among some family members. Generally, few respondents (37.0%, CI: 32.1-42.2) were aware of diseases transmissible from wildlife to humans, although 88.7% (CI: 85.0-92.0) had heard of Ebola or Marburg without context. Hunting non-human primate poses a health risk compared to edible rats (cane rats) and wild ruminants (cOR = 0.4, 95% CI = 0.1-0.9) and (cOR = 0.7, 95% CI = 0.2-2.1) respectively. Study suggests some of the pathways for zoonotic disease spillover to humans exist at interface areas driven by livelihoods, nutrition and cultural needs. This study offers opportunities for a comprehensive risk communication and health education strategy for communities living at the interface of wildlife and human interactions.
   Author summary
   Zoonotic diseases are increasingly becoming an emerging public health threat, partially due to the risk of spillover events at the human-wildlife interface. This cross -sectional study was carried out among high-risk communities around forest fragments of Hoima District, Uganda, to describe activities that could lead to disease spillover in humans in order to inform public health practitioners of the potential risks at community level for preparedness and response efforts. The study also sought to gain an understanding of the community's perception of the risk of zoonotic diseases, what activities could expose them to zoonoses, and whether the healthcare services are adequate to identify such diseases at community level. We found that most people were not aware of zoonotic diseases transmissible from wildlife to humans and this can partly be explained attributed by lack of information filtering through to the grass root. It is important to note however, that the interaction between wildlife and humans, largely driven by communities' struggle to survive and meet their livelihood needs making it difficult to predict under what circumstances disease could emerge in the community. We need to remind ourselves that all major outbreaks have started at community level and well as the health experts are fast to diagnose the disease in question, some communities are hearing these diseases for the very first time. Quite often these outbreaks are putting the available alternative livelihood in question and demanding for quick unstainable changes that communities are quick to abandon once the outbreaks are over. We recommend that this is the time to invest in health education and create awareness about zoonotic diseases among communities at the human-wildlife interface. Health promotion and or livelihood-based intervention programs should use existing evidence and case studies implemented in collaboration with government agencies and partners.

TI  - Interaction of ectoparasites-small mammals in tropical rainforest of Malaysia
T2  - COMMUNITY ECOLOGY
AB  - The literature regarding the diversity of ectoparasites and their interaction with their hosts remains largely inadequate in Malaysian tropical rainforest. We investigate the interaction patterns and specialization of ectoparasites infesting terrestrial small mammals (rodents and scandents) in Peninsular and Malaysian Borneo from samples made in 16 localities between 2008 and 2010. A total of 3,235 individuals of ectoparasites were collected during field surveys, resulting in an interaction network involving 47 ectoparasites that were distributed on 23 species of small mammals. The overall specialization index H-2' of all ectoparasites and host species was 0.67 which was considered moderate. Ticks appeared to be generalist with specialization index (H-2' = 0.35) while lice showed higher specialization (H-2' = 1) in selecting host species. The most diverse parasite assemblage was found on S. muelleri (H-s_w = 1.96). Specialization indices among ectoparasite species (d(p)) ranged from 0.03 to 1 while the indices among host species (d(h)) ranged from 0.20 to 1. Incomplete field data may have contributed to the high specialization indices. This study is significant as it can enhance our understanding the emergence and management of potential zoonotic diseases in Malaysia.

TI  - Shifts from native to invasive small mammals across gradients from tropical forest to urban habitat in Borneo
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - Urbanization has paved the way for the spread of commensal rodents at global scale. However, it is largely unknown how these species use tropical anthropogenic landscapes originally covered with forests and inhabited by diverse small mammal assemblages. We surveyed non-flying small mammals in various urban and suburban habitat types and adjacent forest in the tropical town of Kota Kinabalu in Borneo. We used occupancy and polynomial regression models to determine variation in species occurrences along gradients of land-use intensity. Muller's sundamys (Sundamys muelleri) was the only native small mammal species found in urban and suburban landscapes with a continuous decrease in occurrence probability from forests to urban habitats. The invasive Asian black rat (Rattus rattus species complex) and the invasive Asian house shrew (Suncus murinus) had the highest occurrence probabilities in habitats of intermediate land-use intensity, but Asian black rats are also likely to occasionally invade forested habitats and occupied urban habitats in sympatry with the Norway rat (Rattus norvegicus). In urban and suburban habitats, fallow land possibly favoured the occurrence of S. muelleri and S. murinus. Other native small mammal species (Muridae, Sciuridae, Tupaiidae) were found only in forested areas. Our study shows that native small mammals found in forest are largely replaced by invasive species in urban and suburban habitats. Due to their occurrence in habitats of various land use intensities, S. muelleri and R. rattus comprise central links between forest wildlife and urban species, an association that is important to consider in studies of parasite and disease transmission dynamics.

TI  - Modeling Aboveground Biomass in Tropical Forests Using Multi-Frequency SAR Data-A Comparison of Methods
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
AB  - In the context of climate change mitigation mechanisms for avoiding deforestation, i.e., reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+), comprehensive forest monitoring, especially in tropical regions, is of high relevance. A precise determination of forest carbon stocks or above-ground biomass (AGB) for large areas is of special importance.
   This study analyzes and compares three different methods for retrieving AGB in Indonesia's peat swamp forests from multi-frequency SAR backscatter data. Field inventory AGB data were related to LiDAR measurements allowing plentiful accurate AGB estimations. These estimatedAGB data provided a powerful basis for SAR based AGB model calibration and validation. Multivariate linear regression (MLR), artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector regression (SVR) were examined for their performance to retrieve AGB on the basis of multi-temporal TerraSAR-X and ALOS PALSAR imagery.
   The MLR model resulted in lower coefficients of determination and higher error measures than the other two approaches and showed significant overestimations in the high biomass range. The SVR modeled AGB was more accurate than ANN modeled AGB in terms of independent validation, but showed less variation in the spatial distribution of AGB and saturated at approximately 260 t/ha. The ANN model showed a superior performance for modeling AGB up to 650 t/ha without a saturation in the lower biomass ranges.
   For the needs of REDD+, it is very important to know the possibilities, constraints and uncertainties of AGB retrieval based on satellite imagery.

TI  - Frugivory and habitat use by fruit-eating birds in a fragmented landscape of southeast Brazil
T2  - ORNITOLOGIA NEOTROPICAL
CP  - 7th Neotropical Ornithological Congress
AB  - To investigate the movement of seeds transported by fruit-eating birds in an agricultural, fragmented landscape of the Atlantic forest of southeast Brazil, I asked which bird species are the main seed dispersers in such environment, and how they use the available habitats (small forest fragments, forest thickets, live fences, isolated trees, and active pastures) where they are most likely to drop the seeds they swallow The relative importance of fruit-eating birds as seed vectors was evaluated based on the number of fruit species eaten, the number of visits, and visitation rate to fruiting plants. Habitat use was accessed by recording the habitats where birds were seen or heard during walks conducted throughout the study area. Sixteen plant species were observed during 308.3 plant-hours. Forty-one bird species were observed eating fruits in a total of 830 visits to fruiting plants. Sayaca Tanagers (Thraupis sayaca) and Pale-breasted Thrushes (Turdus leucomelas) ate the greatest number of fruit species, were the most frequent plant visitors in terms of number and rate of visits, and had a broad range of habitat use. These two species and the Rusty-margined Guan (Penelope superciliaris), which is able to swallow large fruits with large seeds that smaller bird species cannot cat, likely have a great contribution to the movement of seeds throughout this highly degraded landscape.

TI  - Vector compositions change across forested to deforested ecotones in emerging areas of zoonotic malaria transmission in Malaysia
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - In lowland areas of Malaysia, Plasmodium knowlesi infection is associated with land use change and high proportions of the vector Anopheles balabacensis. We conducted a 15-month study in two Malaysian villages to determine the effect of habitat on vector populations in understudied high-altitude, high-incidence districts. Anopheles mosquitoes were sampled in human settlements, plantations and forest edges, and screened for Plasmodium species by PCR. We report the first An. donaldi positive for P. knowlesi. This potential vector was associated with habitat fragmentation measured as disturbed forest edge:area ratio, while An. balabacensis was not, indicating fragmented land use could favour An. donaldi. Anopheline species richness and diversity decreased from forest edge, to plantation, to human settlement. Greater numbers of An. balabacensis and An. donaldi were found in forest edges compared to human settlements, suggesting exposure to vectors and associated zoonoses may be greater for people entering this habitat.

TI  - PATTERNS OF FRUGIVORE SPECIES RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE IN FOREST ISLANDS AND IN AGRICULTURAL HABITATS AT LOS-TUXTLAS, MEXICO
T2  - VEGETATIO
AB  - Destruction and fragmentation of tropical rain forest result in a loss of species and of generating capacity of the ecosystem via animal vectors such as seed dispersal agents. To gather quantitative data regarding this ecological problem, birds and mammals were censused in 30 forest fragments, 15 agricultural islands representing five types of vegetation (coffee, cacao, citrus, pepper and mixed-crops) and in three pastures in Los Tuxtlas, southern Veracruz, Mexico. More than 6000 animals of 257 species were detected thus suggesting the existence of a rich species pool in the fragmented landscape. Frugivores accounted for 60% of species, for 72% of individuals censured and for 85% of the total animal biomass recorded. Clusters of small forest fragments (< 100 ha) were richer in species and individuals than clusters of large area (> 100 ha) forest islands. Pastures were especially poor in forest birds and mammals. While the agricultural islands studied contributed to only 1% of the total area of vegetation sampled, they contained 58% of all species detected and 34% of all individual birds and mammals censured. Recaptures indicated inter-island movements of forest birds and mammals. Forty percent of the species were detected in forest habitats only, the rest were detected in forest and in agricultural habitats. Seeds of forest interior plants dispersed by birds and bats were detected in the agricultural habitats. The value of agricultural islands as landscape features providing some degree of biotic connectivity among fragmented animal populations is discussed.

TI  - A canker disease of seedlings and saplings of Tetragastris panamensis (Burseraceae) caused by Botryosphaeria dothidea in a lowland tropical forest
T2  - PLANT DISEASE
AB  - Infection by Botryosphaeria dothidea was associated with stem canker and dieback of seedlings and small saplings of Tetragastris panamensis (Burseraceae) in the lowland tropical moist forest of Barro Colorado Island, Panama. Experimental inoculations in the field resulted in canker formation, reduced plant growth, and increased plant mortality. However, canker development was not a good indicator of the likelihood of mortality, as many inoculated plants died without forming cankers, and plants with cankers that resulted from either natural or experimental infection suffered less mortality than did canker-free plants.

TI  - Deforestation, host community structure, and amphibian disease risk
T2  - BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - Habitat disturbances and the emergence of the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) are linked to accelerated amphibian declines. Deforestation can directly alter amphibian community structure through abiotic and biotic mechanisms including shifts in local microclimates and species interactions. Changes in amphibian community attributes, in turn, potentially impact Bd transmission dynamics, and thus also have an indirect role in biodiversity persistence. Here, we tested whether deforestation influences Bd infections through shifts in amphibian community structure, including species richness, community composition, total host density, and host biomass. We surveyed 22 temperate and tropical amphibian communities across gradients of deforestation in the U.S. and Brazil, and we experimentally exposed a representative subsample of each amphibian community to standardized Bd zoospore loads in mesocosms under controlled microclimate. We found that denser temperate amphibian communities commonly found at pristine sites showed higher Bd loads when microclimates were held constant. In contrast, tropical amphibian communities found at pristine forest sites carried lower Bd infection loads in the absence of variable microclimates, likely due to their host species composition. Previous host exposure to the pathogen in tropical communities also played an important role in determining infection loads; we identified a negative association between Bd infection loads observed in the wild and in the laboratory. Our results highlight that deforestation can have cascading biotic effects on disease risk, and that quantifying the net contribution of host community attributes to Bd infections will help us identify specific drivers of disease and inform conservation strategies.

TI  - Spatiotemporal evolution of tropical forest degradation and its impact on ecological sensitivity: A case study in Jinghong, Xishuangbanna, China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Due to rapid urbanization and a growing population, the tropical forest in southwestern China has experienced a dramatic shrinkage, which threatens its biodiversity and imposes limitations to sustainable development. Spatiotemporal change analysis and ecological sensitivity assessment are the important prerequisites for investigating the relationship between eco-environmental quality and human activities. In this study, the tropical forest and other land cover types in Jinghong, China were firstly classified by a machine learning classification algorithm (support vector machine, SVM) with 7 pairs of remote sensing (RS) data (from 1989 to 2018). Then the spatiotemporal change patterns were analyzed. The ecological sensitivity was evaluated based on an index system method (ISM) in which a weighted combination of eleven indicators were produced using an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method and GIS. Meanwhile four individual sensitivity indicators, including biodiversity sensitivity (BS), water resources sensitivity (WRS), geological hazard sensitivity (GHS) and soil erosion sensitivity (SES) were assessed respectively to create a multi-perspective understanding of the entire ecological sensitivity. The results suggest that the tropical forest experienced a continual decrease from 5631.78 km(2) in 1999 to 4216.23 km(2) in 2018 with an average change rate of -1.49%. The decreased area was mainly encroached on by human settlements and agriculture, particularly in the south of Jinghong. Furthermore, it could be seen that urbanization is the key driver for the changes to ecological sensitivity with both positive and negative impacts. In Jinghong, the region covered by a tropical forest has a relatively higher comprehensive ecological sensitivity (CES) than that of an urban area. This work shows RS and GIS to be powerful tools providing profound insights to researchers with regard to the spatiotemporal evolution of tropical forests and ecological sensitivity. The results are significant for improving policies in order to keep a sustainable balance in regional ecosystem management. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - A review of malaria transmission dynamics in forest ecosystems
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
AB  - Malaria continues to be a major health problem in more than 100 endemic countries located primarily in tropical and sub-tropical regions around the world. Malaria transmission is a dynamic process and involves many interlinked factors, from uncontrollable natural environmental conditions to man-made disturbances to nature. Almost half of the population at risk of malaria lives in forest areas. Forests are hot beds of malaria transmission as they provide conditions such as vegetation cover, temperature, rainfall and humidity conditions that are conducive to distribution and survival of malaria vectors. Forests often lack infrastructure and harbor tribes with distinct genetic traits, socio-cultural beliefs and practices that greatly influence malaria transmission dynamics. Here we summarize the various topographical, entomological, parasitological, human ecological and socio-economic factors, which are crucial and shape malaria transmission in forested areas. An in-depth understanding and synthesis of the intricate relationship of these parameters in achieving better malaria control in various types of forest ecosystems is emphasized.

TI  - Mapping tropical dry forest age using airborne waveform LiDAR and hyperspectral metrics
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
AB  - Tropical dry forest (TDF) regeneration has been extensively characterized as three deterministic successional stages, i.e., early, intermediate, and late, for the past few decades. This deterministic definition, however, ignores many biophysical and biochemical processes in the forest regeneration. This study mapped a second TDF as a function of regeneration age at the Santa Rosa National Park (SRNP) Environmental Monitoring Super Site, Costa Rica, using an airborne full-waveform LiDAR (Laser Vegetation Imaging Sensor or LVIS), a hyperspectral dataset (Hyperspectral MAPper or HyMap) and three advanced machine learning methods. We defined five age groups (0-10 years, 10-20 years, 20-30 years, 30-50 years, 50 + years) based on historical forest cover maps, and analyzed their effective LiDAR waveforms and cumulative return energy curves (derived from LVIS) and their reflectance (derived from the HyMap). Then, nine LVIS metrics and eleven HyMap indices were calculated and their abilities to differentiate the age groups were evaluated using Multiple Comparison Analysis (MCA). We found that six of the LVIS metrics which describe the vertical structure of the forests can significantly differentiate all age groups. None of HyMap metrics can differentiate all age groups, but some of them can identify certain age groups. Selected LVIS metrics and HyMap indices were used to map TDF age, through Support Vector Machine, Artificial Neural Network and Random Forest (RF). We found LVIS plus HyMap metrics generally produced more accurate forest age maps than either LVIS metrics or HyMap indices and RF better performed than other two classifiers. We finally proposed a method to synthesize different forest age maps into one age map which had the highest accuracy for all age groups. Our study highlighted the importance to consider the forest regeneration as a continuous stochastic phenomenon, and also highlighted the advantages to incorporate multiple remote sensing techniques to describe the forest regeneration. Our method to synthesize the forest age map can also benefit other researchers who need to take advantage of multiple mapping results.

TI  - Effects of mycorrhizae and nontarget organisms on restoration of a seasonal tropical forest in Quintana Roo, Mexico:: Factors limiting tree establishment
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
AB  - We initiated a study of the effects of mycorrhizal fungal community composition on the restoration of tropical dry seasonal forest trees. Tree seedlings were planted in a severely burned experimental site (1995 fire) during the growing season of 1998 at the El Eden Ecological Reserve, in north Quintana Roo, Mexico. Seedlings of Leucaena leucocephala, Guazuma ulmifolia, Caesalpinia violacea, Piscidia piscipula, Gliricidia sepium, and Cochlospermum vitifolium were germinated in steam-sterilized soil and either remained uninoculated (nonmycorrhizal at transplanting) or were inoculated with mycorrhizal fungi in soils from early-seral (recently burned) or late-seral (mature forest) inoculum. Inoculum from the early-seral soil was largely Glomus spp., whereas a diverse community of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi were reintroduced from the mature forest including species of Scutellospora, Gigaspora, Glomus, Sclerocystis, and Acaulospora. Plants grew better when associated with the mature forest inoculum, unlike a previous experiment in which plants grew taller with the early-seral inoculum. Reasons for the different responses include a less-intense burn resulting in more residual organic matter. In addition to mycorrhizal responses, plants were severely affected by deer browsing. One tree species, C. vitifolium found in the region but not in the reserve, was eliminated by a resident fungal facultative pathogen. Several practical conclusions for restoration can be made. The common nursery practice of soil sterilization may be detrimental because it eliminates beneficial mycorrhizal fungi; species not native to the site may not survive because they may not be adapted to the local pathogens; and herbivory can be severe depending on the landscape context of the restoration.

TI  - Policy and Science for Global Health Security: Shaping the Course of International Health
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE
AB  - The global burden of infectious diseases and the increased attention to natural, accidental, and deliberate biological threats has resulted in significant investment in infectious disease research. Translating the results of these studies to inform prevention, detection, and response efforts often can be challenging, especially if prior relationships and communications have not been established with decision-makers. Whatever scientific information is shared with decision-makers before, during, and after public health emergencies is highly dependent on the individuals or organizations who are communicating with policy-makers. This article briefly describes the landscape of stakeholders involved in information-sharing before and during emergencies. We identify critical gaps in translation of scientific expertise and results, and biosafety and biosecurity measures to public health policy and practice with a focus on One Health and zoonotic diseases. Finally, we conclude by exploring ways of improving communication and funding, both of which help to address the identified gaps. By leveraging existing scientific information (from both the natural and social sciences) in the public health decision-making process, large-scale outbreaks may be averted even in low-income countries.

TI  - Dispersal of spores of mycorrhizal fungi in scats of native mammals in tropical forests of northeastern Australia
T2  - BIOTROPICA
AB  - One hundred and thirty-eight seat (faecal) samples From 17 mammal species native to forests of northeastern Queensland were examined for the presence of spores of both ectomycorrhizal and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Spores of mycorrhizal fungi were found in 57 percent of scar samples representing 12 animal species (Aepyprymnus rufescens, Antechinus godmani, Bettongia tropica, Hypsiprymnodon moschatus, Isoodon macrourus, Melomys crevinipes, Perameles nasuta, Rattus fuscipes, R. tunneyi, Thylogale stigmatica, Trichosurus vulpecula, Uromys caudimaculatus). Spores were absent in seats of Antechinus stuartii, Dasyurus hallucatus, Dendrolagus lumholtzi, Petaurus australis and Mesembriomys gouldii. Spores of ectomycorrhizal fungi occurred in 38 percent of seats, and all hut one of these samples were from Eucalyptus-dominated sclerophyll forests. Based on the frequency and abundance of spores in seats, five mammals were active considered active consumers of hypogeous mycorrhizal sporocarps in sclerophyll Forests (A. rufescens, B. tropica, I. macrourus, P. nasuta, and U. caudimaculattus). Individual seats of these animals generally contained a range of distinctive spore types. Spores of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi were Found in low abundance in almost 40 percent of seat samples collected, from both sclerophyll forest and rainforest habitats. We suggest that the majority of these spores were acquired incidentally through ingestion of soil during foraging activities on the forest floor. Glasshouse inoculation experiments in which seedlings of Eucalyptus grandis and Sorghum bicolor were inoculated with scat material from several species of mammal demonstrated that the spores of ectomycorrhizal and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi retained some viability and colonized the roots of host-plant seedlings. Insufficient information is known of the ecology of mycorrhizal fungi in Australia's tropical forests to speculate as to the implications of these findings for forest conservation and rehabilitation.

TI  - Forest Disturbance Detection with Seasonal and Trend Model Components and Machine Learning Algorithms
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Forest disturbances reduce the extent of natural habitats, biodiversity, and carbon sequestered in forests. With the implementation of the international framework Reduce Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+), it is important to improve the accuracy in the estimation of the extent of forest disturbances. Time series analyses, such as Breaks for Additive Season and Trend (BFAST), have been frequently used to map tropical forest disturbances with promising results. Previous studies suggest that in addition to magnitude of change, disturbance accuracy could be enhanced by using other components of BFAST that describe additional aspects of the model, such as its goodness-of-fit, NDVI seasonal variation, temporal trend, historical length of observations and data quality, as well as by using separate thresholds for distinct forest types. The objective of this study is to determine if the BFAST algorithm can benefit from using these model components in a supervised scheme to improve the accuracy to detect forest disturbance. A random forests and support vector machines algorithms were trained and verified using 238 points in three different datasets: all-forest, tropical dry forest, and temperate forest. The results show that the highest accuracy was achieved by the support vector machines algorithm using the all-forest dataset. Although the increase in accuracy of the latter model vs. a magnitude threshold model is small, i.e., 0.14% for sample-based accuracy and 0.71% for area-weighted accuracy, the standard error of the estimated total disturbed forest area was 4352.59 ha smaller, while the annual disturbance rate was also smaller by 1262.2 ha year(-1). The implemented approach can be useful to obtain more precise estimates in forest disturbance, as well as its associated carbon emissions.

TI  - Low-intensity logging and hunting have long-term effects on seed dispersal but not fecundity in Afrotropical forests
T2  - AOB PLANTS
AB  - Hunting and logging, ubiquitous human disturbances in tropical forests, have the potential to alter the ecological processes that govern population recruitment and community composition. Hunting-induced declines in populations of seed-dispersing animals are expected to reduce dispersal of the tree species that rely on them, resulting in potentially greater distance- and density-dependent mortality. At the same time, selective logging may alter competitive interactions among tree species, releasing remaining trees from light, nutrient or space limitations. Taken together, these disturbances may alter the community composition of tropical forests, with implications for carbon storage, biodiversity conservation and ecosystem function. To evaluate the effects of hunting and logging on tree fecundity and seed dispersal, we use 3 years of seed rain data from a large-scale observational experiment in previously logged, hunted and protected forests in northern Republic of Congo (Brazzaville). We find that low-intensity logging had a meaningful long-term effect on species-specific seed dispersal distances, though the direction and magnitude varied and was not congruent within dispersal vector. Tree fecundity increased with tree diameter, but did not differ appreciably across disturbance regimes. The species-specific dispersal responses to logging in this study point towards the long-lasting toll of disturbance on ecological function and highlight the necessity of conserving intact forest.

TI  - Automatic Updating of an Object-Based Tropical Forest Cover Classification and Change Assessment
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
AB  - The TREES-3 project of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre is producing estimates of tropical forest cover changes for two time periods: 1990-2000 and 2000-2010. This paper presents the method developed for the automatic change detection and classification of year 2010 imagery integrating the existing segmentation and classification results of the period 1990-2000. The year 2010 imagery is processed in three automatic steps: segmentation, change detection and object spectral classification. The validated maps of forest cover for the years 1990 and 2000 are integrated as thematic input layer into the image segmentation and classification process for the year 2010 data. An object-based change detection technique is applied using Tasseled Cap components and spectral Euclidean distances. Objects detected as changed are classified in two steps: parametric classification based on membership functions and change vector analysis for the remaining unclassified objects. All objects identified as 'unchanged' are used as training areas for parametric classification and spectral signatures are extracted from 2010 imagery. The change vectors are defined according to the validated land cover classification of the year 2000. The segmentation approach was tested on 568 sample units spread over Brazil. The segmentation results for year 2010 demonstrated consistency with the segmentation of imagery for the period 1990-2000. The resulting overall accuracy of the automatic classification was calculated for the 281 sample units of the Brazilian Amazon biome and for 201 sample units of three more complex Brazilian biomes, Caatinga, Cerrado and Pantanal, at 92% and 91% respectively.

TI  - An Integrated Smart Surveillance System for Diseases Monitoring in Tropical Plantation Forests
T2  - 2017 17TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY (ICCT 2017)
CP  - IEEE 17th International Conference on Communication Technology (ICCT)
AB  - The plantation forests are more susceptible to damage by pest and diseases than are natural forest. Monitoring of plantation forest is critical input to the Integrated Pest Management (IPM) process. This study proposes an integrated smart surveillance system for diseases monitoring in tropical plantation forests. The system, called Dismon, is an online and mobile application for monitoring and diseases identification in plantation forests. The application contains three components: digital library, monitoring system and disease identification system. In this work we build the intelligent system for disease monitoring by developing computer vision technology for disease identification through digital image processing. We have examined 1766 leaf samples containing five diseases: leaf spot, leaf blight, leaf curl, phyllode rust and anthracnose leaf spot. In this work, we train Support Vector Machine (SVM) for leaf diseases identification. The experimental results show that the proposed system obtained accuracy of 91% in differentiating healthy leaves and acacia leaf diseases. The ROC curve of acacia leaf identification indicates that the system is reliable to distinguish the leaf diseases. The resulting surveillance system is promising for plantation forests. This application can help surveyors, forest rangers or public users for gathering information, record observation and diseases identification in forest plantation.

TI  - Habitat impacts the abundance and network structure within tick (Acari: Ixodidae) communities on tropical small mammals
T2  - TICKS AND TICK-BORNE DISEASES
AB  - Ticks of small mammals pose a significant risk to public health but these hazards are poorly understood in the tropics due to the paucity of information on the disease ecology of ticks in these regions. Mapping and quan-tifying the diversity of small mammal/tick networks and the effects of habitat on these medically important systems is key to disease prevention. Singapore represents a microcosm of much of tropical Asia as it has a diverse, though poorly studied, community of ticks and small mammals. Singapore also has a range of terrestrial habitats exhibiting a gradient of degradation. Small mammals and their ticks were sampled across the island in four main habitat types (old secondary forest, young secondary forest, scrubland, urban) across 4.5 years. Four tick species were collected (Amblyomma helvolum, Dermacentor auratus, Haemaphysalis semermis, Ixodes gran-ulatus) from 10 small mammal species. Habitat was found to have a significant effect on both the abundance and structure of tick communities on small mammals. Old secondary forest communities had the highest tick abundance, comparatively high connectance, niche overlap (among ticks), linkage density, and were the preferred habitat of the zoonotic tick I. granulatus. Therefore, future disease spillover is likely to emerge from small mammal-tick communities in old secondary forests.

TI  - Human exposure to zoonotic malaria vectors in village, farm and forest habitats in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - The zoonotic malaria parasite,Plasmodium knowlesi, is now a substantial public health problem in Malaysian Borneo. Current understanding ofP.knowlesivector bionomics and ecology in Sabah comes from a few studies near the epicentre of human cases in one district, Kudat. These have incriminatedAnopheles balabacensisas the primary vector, and suggest that human exposure to vector biting is peri-domestic as well as in forest environments. To address the limited understanding of vector ecology and human exposure risk outside of Kudat, we performed wider scale surveillance across four districts in Sabah with confirmed transmission to investigate spatial heterogeneity in vector abundance, diversity and infection rate. Entomological surveillance was carried out six months after a cross-sectional survey ofP.knowlesiprevalence in humans throughout the study area; providing an opportunity to investigate associations between entomological indicators and infection. Human-landing catches were performed in peri-domestic, farm and forest sites in 11 villages (3-4 per district) and paired with estimates of humanP.knowlesiexposure based on sero-prevalence.Anopheles balabacensiswas present in all districts but only 6/11 villages. The mean density ofAn.balabacensiswas relatively low, but significantly higher in farm (0.094/night) and forest (0.082/night) than peri-domestic areas (0.007/night). Only oneAn.balabacensis(n = 32) was infected withP.knowlesi.Plasmodium knowlesisero-positivity in people was not associated withAn.balabacensisdensity at the village-level however post hoc analyses indicated the study had limited power to detect a statistical association due low vector density. Wider scale sampling revealed substantial heterogeneity in vector density and distribution between villages and districts. Vector-habitat associations predicted from this larger-scale surveillance differed from those inferred from smaller-scale studies in Kudat; highlighting the importance of local ecological context. Findings highlight potential trade-offs between maximizing temporal versus spatial breadth when designing entomological surveillance; and provide baseline entomological and epidemiological data to inform future studies of entomological risk factors for humanP.knowlesiinfection.

TI  - Assessing the Utility of Sentinel-1 Coherence Time Series for Temperate and Tropical Forest Mapping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - This study tested the ability of Sentinel-1 C-band to separate forest from other common land use classes (i.e., urban, low vegetation and water) at two different sites. The first site is characterized by temperate forests and rough terrain while the second by tropical forest and near-flat terrain. We trained a support vector machine classifier using increasing feature sets starting from annual backscatter statistics (average, standard deviation) and adding long-term coherence (i.e., coherence estimate for two acquisitions with a large time difference), as well as short-term (six to twelve days) coherence statistics from annual time series. Classification accuracies using all feature sets was high (>92% overall accuracy). For temperate forests the overall accuracy improved by up to 5% when coherence features were added: long-term coherence reduced misclassification of forest as urban, whereas short-term coherence statistics reduced the misclassification of low vegetation as forest. Classification accuracy for tropical forests showed little differences across feature sets, as the annual backscatter statistics sufficed to separate forest from low vegetation, the other dominant land cover. Our results show the importance of coherence for forest classification over rough terrain, where forest omission error was reduced up to 11%.

TI  - Liana canopy cover mapped throughout a tropical forest with high-fidelity imaging spectroscopy
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Increasing size and abundance of lianas relative to trees are pervasive changes in Neotropical forests that may lead to reduced forest carbon stocks. Yet the liana growth form is chronically understudied in large-scale tropical forest censuses, resulting in few data on the scale, cause, and impact of increasing lianas. Satellite and airborne remote sensing provide potential tools to map and monitor lianas at much larger spatial and rapid temporal scales than are possible with plot-based forest censuses. We combined high-resolution airborne imaging spectroscopy and a ground-based tree canopy census to investigate whether tree canopies supporting lianas could be discriminated from tree canopies with no liana coverage. Using support vector machine algorithms, we achieved accuracies of nearly 90% in discriminating the presence-absence of lianas, and low error (15.7% RMSE) when predicting liana percent canopy cover. When applied to the full image of the study site, our model had a 4.1% false-positive error rate as validated against an independent plot-level dataset of liana canopy cover. Using the derived liana cover classification map, we show that 6.1%-10.2% of the 1823 ha study site has high-to-severe (50-100%) liana canopy cover. Given that levels of liana infestation are increasing in Neotropical forests and can result in high tree mortality, the extent of high-to-severe liana canopy cover across the landscape may have broad implications for ecosystem function and forest carbon storage. The ability to accurately map landscape-scale liana infestation is crucial to quantifying their effects on forest function and uncovering the mechanisms underlying their increase.

TI  - Parasites and Other Infectious Agents in Non-human Primates of Argentina
T2  - CURRENT TROPICAL MEDICINE REPORTS
AB  - Purpose of Review In Argentina, there are five non-human primate (NHP) species: Sapajus nigritus cucullatus, Sapajus cay, Alouatta caraya, Alouatta guariba clamitans, and Aotus azarae. All of them inhabit protected and non-protected areas and face severe threats due anthropization. We aim to summarize the information available about parasites and infectious diseases of these NHPs and suggest further research on primate diseases in Argentina. Recent Findings NHPs of Argentina are hosts of several parasites and pathogens important for conservation as well as public health. Alouatta species are lethally susceptible to yellow fever virus, which makes them suitable health sentinels of possible outbreaks. For other primate species, few parasite surveys have been carried out. Assessing the presence of infectious diseases and long-term surveillance on NHP allow the development of strategies to help in the early detection of pathogens that may threat public health. Increasing the knowledge about parasites and infectious diseases and their consequences in NHP of Argentina is needed, considering a One Health approach.

TI  - The Role of Ecological Linkage Mechanisms in <i>Plasmodium knowlesi</i> Transmission and Spread
T2  - ECOHEALTH
AB  - Defining the linkages between landscape change, disease ecology and human health is essential to explain and predict the emergence of Plasmodium knowlesi malaria, a zoonotic parasite residing in Southeast Asian macaques, and transmitted by species of Anopheles mosquitos. Changing patterns of land use throughout Southeast Asia, particularly deforestation, are suggested to be the primary drivers behind the recent spread of this zoonotic parasite in humans. Local ecological changes at the landscape scale appear to be increasing the risk of disease in humans by altering the dynamics of transmission between the parasite and its primary hosts. This paper will focus on the emergence of P. knowlesi in humans in Malaysian Borneo and the ecological linkage mechanisms suggested to be playing an important role.

TI  - Veterinary aspects of ecological monitoring: the natural history of emerging infectious diseases of humans, domestic animals and wildlife
T2  - TROPICAL ANIMAL HEALTH AND PRODUCTION
AB  - Proliferation of disease pathogens capable of affecting humans, domestic livestock and wildlife increasingly threatens environmental security and biodiversity. Livestock and wild animals in proximity to human beings are often in the chain of transmission and infection. Globalization of industrial livestock production (especially poultry upon which so much of the burgeoning human population depends) often permits transcontinental disease spread. Rapidly expanding (and often illegal) international trade in wild and domestic animals and their products are increasingly involved in the emergence of new diseases that may have the ability to transmit among humans, livestock and wildlife. Rapidly increasing urbanization has led in many places to overcrowded townships that rely on "bushmeat" for sustenance and has contributed to the emergence of virulent zoonotic pathogens. The emergence and proliferation of pathogens are exacerbated by anthropogenic transformation of natural landscapes in order to increase agricultural and livestock production. This paper posits that data gathered by veterinary ecologists should be interpreted and used by other disciplines. The importance of a thorough knowledge of the "natural history" (ecology) of the disease agent and its human, domestic and wild hosts is stressed.

TI  - <i>Plasmodium</i> infection in <i>Kerteszia cruzii</i> (Diptera: Culicidae) in the Atlantic tropical rain forest, southeastern Brazil
T2  - INFECTION GENETICS AND EVOLUTION
AB  - In Southeastern Brazil, Kerteszia cruzii (former Anopheles cruzii), a bromeliad mosquito species, is considered an efficient human Plasmodium spp. vector. In this region, recent studies showed asymptomatic or sub-patent Plasmodium falciparum infection. In areas of the Atlantic coast in Rio de Janeiro, Plasmodium simium infection was recently reported in both human and howler monkey. Considering that (1) few malaria cases are reported each year in areas across the tropical Atlantic rain forest in southeastern Brazil; (2) malaria elimination in Atlantic forest is challenged by circulation of P. falciparum and P. simium in humans; (3) the complexity of malaria epidemiology in this region; and (4) the public health importance of Kerteszia cruzii as a sylvatic vector; the major goal of this study is to evaluate Plasmodium infection in Ke. cruzii. Mosquito sampling collections were conducted in Esteiro do Morro and Sitio Itapuan, in Cananeia municipality, and Tapirai municipality in Ribeira Valley, southeastern Sao Paulo state, Brazil. Influence of climate and landscape factors in Plasmodium infection in Ke. cruzii was addressed. Among the 1719 mosquitoes tested, 3 females collected in Sitio Itapuan and three from Tapirai were found infected with either P. vivax or P. simium. Results of statistical analyses did not demonstrate association between Plasmodium infection in mosquito and the landscape. Mosquito infection was found in two landscape clusters, with Plasmodium detected in forest fringe mosquitoes. This finding shows that Ke. cruzii can facilitate transmission among human and non-human primates. Plasmodium falciparum was not identified in the samples analyzed. Spatiotemporal variation in local malaria incidence, low prevalence of Plasmodium, variations in humidity and temperature can explain the absence of mosquitoes infected with P. falciparum in the study.

TI  - Influence of land use and host species on parasite richness, prevalence and co-infection patterns
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY
AB  - Tropical forests are experiencing increasing impacts from a multitude of anthropogenic activities such as logging and conversion to agricultural use. These perturbations are expected to have strong impacts on ecological interactions and on the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases. To date, no clear picture of the effects of deforestation on vector-borne disease transmission has emerged. This is associated with the challenge of studying complex systems where many vertebrate hosts and vectors co-exist. To overcome this problem, we focused on an innately simplified system - a small oceanic island (Sao Tome, Gulf of Guinea). We analyzed the impacts of human land-use on host-parasite interactions by sampling the bird community (1735 samples from 30 species) in natural and anthropogenic land use at different elevations, and screened individuals for haemosporidian parasites from three genera (Plasmodium, Haemoproteus, Leucocytozoon). Overall, Plasmodium had the highest richness but the lowest prevalence, while Leucocytozoon diversity was the lowest despite having the highest prevalence. Interestingly, co-infections (i.e. intra-host diversity) involved primarily Leucocytozoon lineages (95%). We also found marked differences between bird species and habitats. Some bird species showed low prevalence but harbored high diversity of parasites, while others showed high prevalence but were infected with fewer lineages. These infection dynamics are most likely driven by host specificity of parasites and intrinsic characteristics of hosts. In addition, Plasmodium was more abundant in disturbed habitats and at lower elevations, while Leucocytozoon was more prevalent in forest areas and at higher elevations. These results likely reflect the ecological requirements of their vectors: mosquitoes and black flies, respectively. (C) 2020 Australian Society for Parasitology. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - FOREST ECOSYSTEM DYNAMICS ASSESSMENT AND PREDICTIVE MODELLING IN EASTERN HIMALAYA
T2  - ISPRS BHOPAL 2011 WORKSHOP EARTH OBSERVATION FOR TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEM
CP  - ISPRS Bhopal Workshop on Earth Observation for Terrestrial Ecosystem
AB  - This study focused on the forest ecosystem dynamics assessment and predictive modelling deforestation and forest cover prediction in a part of north-eastern India i.e. forest areas along West Bengal, Bhutan, Arunachal Pradesh and Assam border in Eastern Himalaya using temporal satellite imagery of 1975, 1990 and 2009 and predicted forest cover for the period 2028 using Cellular Automata Markov Modedel (CAMM). The exercise highlighted large-scale deforestation in the study area during 1975-1990 as well as 1990-2009 forest cover vectors. A net loss of 2,334.28 km(2) forest cover was noticed between 1975 and 2009, and with current rate of deforestation, a forest area of 4,563.34 km(2) will be lost by 2028. The annual rate of deforestation worked out to be 0.35 and 0.78% during 1975-1990 and 1990-2009 respectively. Bamboo forest increased by 24.98% between 1975 and 2009 due to opening up of the forests. Forests in Kokrajhar, Barpeta, Darrang, Sonitpur, and Dhemaji districts in Assam were noticed to be worst-affected while Lower Subansiri, West and East Siang, Dibang Valley, Lohit and Changlang in Arunachal Pradesh were severely affected. Among different forest types, the maximum loss was seen in case of sal forest (37.97%) between 1975 and 2009 and is expected to deplete further to 60.39% by 2028. The tropical moist deciduous forest was the next category, which decreased from 5,208.11 km(2) to 3,447.28 (33.81%) during same period with further chances of depletion to 2,288.81 km(2) (56.05%) by 2028. It noted progressive loss of forests in the study area between 1975 and 2009 through 1990 and predicted that, unless checked, the area is in for further depletion of the invaluable climax forests in the region, especially sal and moist deciduous forests. The exercise demonstrated high potential of remote sensing and geographic information system for forest ecosystem dynamics assessment and the efficacy of CAMM to predict the forest cover change.

TI  - Tree Species Discrimination in Tropical Forests Using Airborne Imaging Spectroscopy
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
AB  - We identify canopy species in a Hawaiian tropical forest using supervised classification applied to airborne hyperspectral imagery acquired with the Carnegie Airborne Observatory-Alpha system. Nonparametric methods (linear and radial basis function support vector machine, artificial neural network, and k-nearest neighbor) and parametric methods (linear, quadratic, and regularized discriminant analysis) are compared for a range of species richness values and training sample sizes. We find a clear advantage in using regularized discriminant analysis, linear discriminant analysis, and support vector machines. No unique optimal classifier was found for all conditions tested, but we highlight the possibility of improving support vector machine classification with a better optimization of its free parameters. We also confirm that a combination of spectral and spatial information increases accuracy of species classification: we combine segmentation and species classification from regularized discriminant analysis to produce a map of the 17 discriminated species. Finally, we compare different methods to assess spectral separability and find a better ability of Bhattacharyya distance to assess separability within and among species. The results indicate that species mapping is tractable in tropical forests when using high-fidelity imaging spectroscopy.

TI  - Response to Valle and Zorello Laporta: Clarifying the Use of Instrumental Variable Methods to Understand the Effects of Environmental Change on Infectious Disease Transmission
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Identifying the effects of environmental change on the transmission of vectorbome and zoonotic diseases is of fundamental importance in the face of rapid global change. Causal inference approaches, including instrumental variable (IV) estimation, hold promise in disentangling plausibly causal relationships from observational data in these complex systems. Valle and Zorello Laporta recently critiqued the application of such approaches in our recent study of the effects of deforestation on malaria transmission in the Brazilian Amazon on the grounds that key statistical assumptions were not met. Here, we respond to this critique by 1) deriving the IV estimator to clarify the assumptions that Valle and Zorello Laporta conflate and misrepresent in their critique, 2) discussing these key assumptions as they relate to our original study and how our original approach reasonably satisfies the assumptions, and 3) presenting model results using alternative instrumental variables that can be argued more strongly satisfy key assumptions, illustrating that our results and original conclusion-that deforestation drives malaria transmission-remain unchanged.

TI  - Soil Metagenome of Tropical White Sand Heath Forests in Borneo: What Functional Traits Are Associated with an Extreme Environment Within the Tropical Rainforest?
T2  - PEDOSPHERE
AB  - White sand heath forests (WS) or kerangas, an unusual variant of tropical forests in Borneo, characterized by open scrubby vegetation, low productivity, and distinctive plant species composition and soil microbial community, are regarded as a stressful lowpH and/or nutrient environment. We investigated whether the functional soil metagenome also shows a predicted set of indicators of stressful conditions in WS. Based on stress-tolerant strategies exhibited by larger organisms, we hypothesized that genes for stress tolerance, dormancy, sporulation, and nutrient processing are more abundant in the soil microbiota of WS. We also hypothesized that there is less evidence of biotic interaction in white sand soils, with lower connectivity and fewer genes related to organismic interactions. In Brunei, we sampled soils from a WS and a normal primary dipterocarp forest, together with an inland heath, an intermediate forest type. Soil DNA was extracted, and shotgun sequencing was performed using Illumina HiSeq platform, with classification by the Metagenomics Rapid Annotation using Subsystem Technology (MG-RAST). The results, on one hand, supported our hypothesis (on greater abundance of dormancy, virulence, and sporulation-related genes). However, some aspects of our results showed no significant difference (specifically in stress tolerance, antibiotic resistance, viruses, and clustered regularly interspaced short palindrome repeats (CRISPRs)). It appears that in certain respects, the extreme white sand environment produces the predicted strategy of less biotic interaction, but exhibits high soil microbiota connectivity and functional diversity.

TI  - Extremely Low Prevalence of <i>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</i> in Frog Populations from Neotropical Dry Forest of Costa Rica Supports the Existence of a Climatic Refuge from Disease
T2  - ECOHEALTH
AB  - Population declines and extinctions of numerous species of amphibians, especially stream-breeding frogs, have been linked to the emerging infectious disease chytridiomycosis, caused by the chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. In Central America, most of the 34 species of the Craugastor punctariolus species group have disappeared in recent years in high- and low-elevation rainforests. Distribution models for B. dendrobatidis and the continuous presence of the extirpated stream-dwelling species, Craugastor ranoides, in the driest site of Costa Rica (Santa Elena Peninsula), suggest that environmental conditions might restrict the growth and development of B. dendrobatidis, existing as a refuge from chytridiomycosis-driven extinction. We conducted field surveys to detect and quantify the pathogen using Real-time PCR in samples from 15 species of frogs in two locations of tropical dry forest. In Santa Elena Peninsula, we swabbed 310 frogs, and only one sample of the species, C. ranoides, tested positive for B. dendrobatidis (prevalence < 0.1%). In Santa Rosa Station, we swabbed 100 frogs, and nine samples from three species tested positive (prevalence = 9.0%). We failed to detect signs of chytridiomycosis in any of the 410 sampled frogs, and low quantities of genetic equivalents (between 0 and 1073) were obtained from the ten positive samples. The difference in the prevalence between locations might be due not only to the hotter and drier conditions of Santa Elena Peninsula but also to the different compositions of species in both locations. Our results suggest that B. dendrobatidis is at the edge of its distribution in these dry and hot environments of tropical dry forest. This study supports the existence of climatic refuges from chytridiomycosis and highlights the importance of tropical dry forest conservation for amphibians in the face of epidemic disease.

TI  - Mosquito (Diptera: Culicidae) Diversity of a Forest-Fragment Mosaic in the Amazon Rain Forest
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - To study the impact of Amazonian forest fragmentation on the mosquito fauna, an inventory of Culicidae was conducted in the upland forest research areas of the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project located 60 km north of Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil. The culicid community was sampled monthly between February 2002 and May 2003. CDC light traps, flight interception traps, manual aspiration, and net sweeping were used to capture adult specimens along the edges and within forest fragments of different sizes (1, 10, and 100 ha), in second-growth areas surrounding the fragments and around camps. We collected 5,204 specimens, distributed in 18 genera and 160 species level taxa. A list of mosquito taxa is presented with 145 species found in the survey, including seven new records for Brazil, 16 new records for the state of Amazonas, along with the 15 morphotypes that probably represent undescribed species. No exotic species [Aedes aegypti (L.) and Aedes albopictus (Skuse)] were found within the sampled areas. Several species collected are potential vectors of Plasmodium causing human malaria and of various arboviruses. The epidemiological and ecological implications of mosquito species found are discussed, and the results are compared with other mosquito inventories from the Amazon region.

TI  - Mechanistic insights into landscape genetic structure of two tropical amphibians using field-derived resistance surfaces
T2  - MOLECULAR ECOLOGY
AB  - Conversion of forests to agriculture often fragments distributions of forest species and can disrupt gene flow. We examined effects of prevalent land uses on genetic connectivity of two amphibian species in northeastern Costa Rica. We incorporated data from field surveys and experiments to develop resistance surfaces that represent local mechanisms hypothesized to modify dispersal success of amphibians, such as habitat-specific predation and desiccation risk. Because time lags can exist between forest conversion and genetic responses, we evaluated landscape effects using land-cover data from different time periods. Populations of both species were structured at similar spatial scales but exhibited differing responses to landscape features. Litter frog population differentiation was significantly related to landscape resistances estimated from abundance and experiment data. Model support was highest for experiment-derived surfaces that represented responses to microclimate variation. Litter frog genetic variation was best explained by contemporary landscape configuration, indicating rapid population response to land-use change. Poison frog genetic structure was strongly associated with geographic isolation, which explained up to 45% of genetic variation, and long-standing barriers, such as rivers and mountains. However, there was also partial support for abundance- and microclimate response-derived resistances. Differences in species responses to landscape features may be explained by overriding effects of population size on patterns of differentiation for poison frogs, but not litter frogs. In addition, pastures are likely semi-permeable to poison frog gene flow because the species is known to use pastures when remnant vegetation is present, but litter frogs do not. Ongoing reforestation efforts will probably increase connectivity in the region by increasing tree cover and reducing area of pastures.

TI  - Disaggregating Tropical Disease Prevalence by Climatic and Vegetative Zones within Tropical West Africa
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Tropical infectious disease prevalence is dependent on many socio-cultural determinants. However, rainfall and temperature frequently underlie overall prevalence, particularly for vector-borne diseases. As a result these diseases have increased prevalence in tropical as compared to temperate regions. Specific to tropical Africa, the tendency to incorrectly infer that tropical diseases are uniformly prevalent has been partially overcome with solid epidemiologic data. This finer resolution data is important in multiple contexts, including understanding risk, predictive value in disease diagnosis, and population immunity. We hypothesized that within the context of a tropical climate, vector-borne pathogen prevalence would significantly differ according to zonal differences in rainfall, temperature, relative humidity and vegetation condition. We then determined if these environmental data were predictive of pathogen prevalence. First we determined the prevalence of three major pathogens of cattle, Anaplasma marginale, Babesia bigemina and Theileria spp, in the three vegetation zones where cattle are predominantly raised in Ghana: Guinea savannah, semi-deciduous forest, and coastal savannah. The prevalence of A. marginale was 63%, 26% for Theileria spp and 2% for B. bigemina. A. marginale and Theileria spp. were significantly more prevalent in the coastal savannah as compared to either the Guinea savanna or the semi-deciduous forest, supporting acceptance of the first hypothesis. To test the predictive power of environmental variables, the data over a three year period were considered in best subsets multiple linear regression models predicting prevalence of each pathogen. Corrected Akaike Information Criteria (AICc) were assigned to the alternative models to compare their utility. Competitive models for each response were averaged using AICc weights. Rainfall was most predictive of pathogen prevalence, and EVI also contributed to A. marginale and B. bigemina prevalence. These findings support the utility of environmental data for understanding vector-borne disease epidemiology on a regional level within a tropical environment.

TI  - Movements of Indian Flying Fox in Myanmar as a Guide to Human-Bat Interface Sites
T2  - ECOHEALTH
AB  - Frugivorous bats play a vital role in tropical ecosystems as pollinators and seed dispersers but are also important vectors of zoonotic diseases. Myanmar sits at the intersection of numerous bioregions and contains habitats that are important for many endangered and endemic species. This rapidly developing country also forms a connection between hotspots of emerging human diseases. We deployed Global Positioning System collars to track the movements of 10 Indian flying fox (Pteropus giganteus) in the agricultural landscapes of central Myanmar. We used clustering analysis to identify foraging sites and high-utilization areas. As part of a larger viral surveillance study in bats of Myanmar, we also collected oral and rectal swab samples from 29 bats to test for key emerging viral diseases in this colony. There were no positive results detected for our chosen viruses. We analyzed their foraging movement behavior and evaluated selected foraging sites for their potential as human-wildlife interface sites.

Restoration of ecosystem health and productivity has generally relied on abandonment of land and subsequent natural forest succession. In recent years there has been consideration of management options to accelerate recovery and restore productivity, biodiversity and other values. The use of tree plantations to catalyze restoration of degraded forests and lands in the tropics was addressed at a symposium in Washington DC in June 1996. The conclusions and suggestions for future research to develop appropriate management options are reported. There is strong evidence that plantations can facilitate forest succession in their understories through modification of both physical and biological site conditions. Changes in light, temperature and moisture at the soil surface enable germination and growth of seeds transported to the site by wildlife and other vectors from adjacent forest remnants. Development and design of management options to assist this process are required, taking into account socio-economic realities, development priorities and conservation goals.

TI  - Mosquito (Diptera: Culicidae) diversity and medical importance in Koh Kong mangrove forests, Cambodia
T2  - ASIAN BIOMEDICINE
AB  - Background Mangroves are an ecosystem interface between land and sea, forming distinctive shallow-water marine communities in tropical and subtropical waters. The mangrove forest surface in Cambodia is being reduced due to deforestation. Because the mangrove type of ecosystem generally hosts a great diversity of mosquitoes, the urbanization of these ecosystems will increase interactions between humans and wild mosquitoes, and might thus serve as a potential source of new infectious diseases. Understanding mosquito diversity and analyzing their virome is critical to estimate the risk of emergence or future outbreaks of mosquito-borne diseases. Objective To understand the mosquito diversity of mangrove forests of Koh Kong province (Cambodia). Methods In 2019, the mosquito fauna was sampled for 3 consecutive days using BG-Sentinel and light traps, in 3 locations in the mangrove forests of Koh Kong province (Cambodia) during both dry and rainy seasons. Results A total of 3107 samples were collected, belonging to 10 genera for 34 species. The Culex genus was the most diverse, accounting for 10 species. One species, Culex sitiens, represented over 60% of all collected mosquitoes. A total of 12 medically important species were recorded, 2 species, Aedes (Stegomyia) albopictus and Culex vishnui, were collected in all sites and during both the dry and rainy seasons, highlighting a potential risk of these species acting as bridge vectors. Conclusions If new arboviruses were to be recorded in this peculiar area, it would indicate that the mosquito species found have the potential to act as a bridge between sylvatic and anthropogenic arboviruses.

TI  - The effects of climate change on tropical birds
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Birds are among the most widely studied organisms on earth and represent an important indicator group for learning about the effects of climate change - particularly in regard to the effects of climate change on tropical ecosystems. In this review, we assess the potential impacts of climate change on tropical birds and discuss the factors that affect species' ability to adapt and survive the impending alterations in habitat availability. Tropical mountain birds, species without access to higher elevations, coastal forest birds, and restricted-range species are especially vulnerable. Some birds may be especially susceptible to increased rainfall seasonality and to extreme weather events, such as heat waves, cold spells, and tropical cyclones. Birds that experience limited temperature variation and have low basal metabolic rates will be the most prone to the physiological effects of warming temperatures and heat waves. Mostly unknown species' interactions, indirect effects, and synergies of climate change with other threats, such as habitat loss, emerging diseases, invasive species, and hunting will exacerbate the effects of climate change on tropical birds. In some models habitat loss can increase bird extinctions caused by climate change by 50%. 3.5 degrees C surface warming by the year 2100 may result in 600-900 extinctions of land bird species, 89% of which occur in the tropics. Depending on the amount of future habitat loss, each degree of surface warming could lead to approximately 100-500 additional bird extinctions. Protected areas will be more important than ever, but they need to be designed with climate change in mind. Although 92% of currently protected areas are likely to become climatically unsuitable in a century, for example only 7 or 8 priority species' preferred climatic envelopes are projected to be entirely lost from the African Important Bird Area network. Networks of protected areas need to incorporate extensive topographical diversity, cover wide elevational ranges, have high connectivity, and integrate human-dominated landscapes into conservation schemes. Most tropical bird species vulnerable to climate change are not currently considered threatened with extinction, often due to lack of knowledge; systematically and regularly gathering information on the ecology, and current and future distributions of these species is an urgent priority. Locally based, long-term tropical bird monitoring and conservation programs based on adaptive management are essential to help protect birds against climate change.

TI  - The seedling community of tropical rain forest edges and its interaction with herbivores and pathogens
T2  - BIOTROPICA
AB  - Edge effects alter biotic interactions and forest regeneration. We investigated whether edge creation affected the seedling community and its interactions with herbivores and leaf-fungal pathogens. In forest edges and interior sites in Chiapas Mexico, we counted all woody seedlings and species (10-100 cm tall) present in 1-m(2) plots, measured their size (height and leaf number), and examined them for the occurrence of herbivory and pathogen damage. We investigated relationships between levels of damage and size, species richness and density. Species composition and biotic damage varied greatly among sites and habitats (edge vs interior). Late-successional species dominated the community, but richness was lower in interior sites and species similarity was greater among edges than among interiors. Nearly all species (95%) present at edges and interiors showed herbivory damage, whereas 76 percent of the species in edge plots and 68 percent in interior plots showed pathogen damage. Although leaf area damaged by herbivores was similar between habitats (average 9.2%), pathogen damage was three times greater in edge plots (1.85%) than in interior plots (0.57%). Size was positively related to biotic damage at both habitats. Relationships between herbivory and pathogen damage and between pathogen damage and leaf number were significant only for edges. Biotic damage was not related to density or species richness. Overall, plant community structure was similar between habitats, but biotic damage was enhanced at edges. Thus, disease spread at edges may arise as a threat to tropical rain forest vegetation.

TI  - Hunting of flying foxes and perception of disease risk in Indonesian Borneo
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Widespread hunting of flying foxes has generated concern regarding population declines and the spread of emerging infectious diseases. To investigate the potential impacts of this trade, we conducted questionnaires in 45 settlements across 12 population centres within Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, a region previously identified as a hunting hotspot. By combining results from 63 hunter and 88 vendor interviews, we highlight two population centres (Palangka Raya and Buntok/Tamiang Layang) with higher hunting rates than other areas, which act as flying fox trading hubs. Flying fox populations were perceived to be declining province-wide: declines in captures and sales were reported by 81% of hunters and 60% of market vendors, who also reported availability as the key factor underlying temporal variations in trade. There was substantial risk of zoonotic disease transmission between bats, hunters and traders: the vast majority of respondents were unaware that flying foxes carry potentially fatal viruses, and so few people protected themselves from physical contact. Moreover, both hunters and vendors were frequently bitten and the majority of bites drew blood. Most hunters (58%) also reported unintentional by-catches that included keystone bird species and slow lorises. The scale of hunting over Central Kalimantan represents a serious threat to the long-term viability of flying fox populations (and potentially those of other species), and could have serious public health implications. Reducing or eliminating hunting and trade would mitigate the risk of disease transmission, while maintaining the economic and ecosystem benefits that flying foxes provide, in terms of pollination and seed dispersal.

TI  - Microbial nutrient limitation in tropical forest soils determined using the V-T model contradicts the traditional view that C is the major limiting element
T2  - TROPICS
AB  - Traditionally, microbial activity in tropical forest soils has been thought to be limited predominantly by carbon (C) availability, prompting investigations of whether phosphorus (P) is a stronger limiting factor (next to C) than other nutrients. However, a recently developed enzyme vector model has sometimes shown that P or nitrogen (N), but not C, is the predominant limiting factor, likely due to biased C vs. N vs. P limitation thresholds. In the latest update of this approach (the V-T model) this problem was addressed by revising the threshold, or balance point, that represents the enzymatic ratio at which microbial metabolism is not limited by nutrients. However, it remains unclear whether results obtained using the V-T model are consistent with the traditional view that C is the predominant limiting element for soil microbial activity. In this short note, I analyzed the microbial resource limitations of tropical forest soils using the V-T model approach based on previously published global data, and discussed the consistency of the results with the traditional view. The V-T model results showed that up to 78 % of the data indicated that P, and not C, was the limiting element, contradicting the traditional view. This finding may have been the result of a bias in the balance point toward C limitation (i.e., the balance point, or threshold, used for determining microbial nutrient limitation is under C-limited condition, rather than under no nutrient limitation), resulting in underestimation of C limitation. The present study suggest that the V-T model requires further improvement; however, the traditional view of C limitation of soil microbial activity is also poorly supported, and further direct observation is needed.

TI  - AN EXAMINATION OF TROPICAL RAIN-FOREST MICROCLIMATE USING GIS MODELING
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY LETTERS
AB  - Singapore's evolution to a city state has involved the removal of 95% of the original tropical rain forest cover, leaving only a total of 2700 hectares under primary and secondary forest. This area in the centre of the island is protected as water catchment and nature reserves in spite of intense pressure for development.
   The paper describes the utilization of thermal imagery recorded by the Landsat Thematic Mapper for the mapping of forest canopy temperature in Singapore's forested nature reserves as an indication of ecological conditions as they relate to forest microclimate.
   Landsat digital data were converted to surface temperature in degrees Celsius and input into a vector Geographic Information System for overlay with existing data layers representing high forest, water bodies, and a digital elevation model (DEM), enabling the examination of the spatial characteristics of forest canopy temperatures. The spatial patterns are observed to correspond to ecological parameters which have relevance for forest conservation assessment. Thus the main environmental factors affecting canopy temperature appear to be topology, aspect and soil moisture availability.

TI  - Impact of foot-and-mouth disease status on deforestation in Brazilian Amazon and <i>cerrado</i> municipalities between 2000 and 2010
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMICS AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon released approximately 5.7 billion tons of CO2 to the atmosphere between 2000 and 2010, and 50-80% of this deforestation was for pasture. Most assume that increasing demand for cattle products produced in Brazil caused this deforestation, but the empirical work to-date on cattle documents only correlations between cattle herd size, pasture expansion, cattle prices, and deforestation. This paper uses panel data on deforestation and foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) status-an exogenous demand shifter-to estimate whether changes in FMD status caused new deforestation in municipalities in the Brazilian Amazon and cerrado biomes during the 2000-2010 period. Results suggest that, on average, becoming certified as FMD-free caused a temporary spike in deforestation in the 2 years after a municipality became FMD-free, but caused subsequent deforestation to decline relative to infected municipalities during the 2000-2010 period.

TI  - Relating species richness to the structure of continuous landscapes: alternative methodological approaches
T2  - ECOSPHERE
AB  - Numerous studies have focused on the relationship between landscape structure and plant diversity based on the patch-mosaic landscape paradigm, by deriving structural data from classified images. Since the use of discrete classes poses limitations for predicting biodiversity patterns in complex, low human-impacted ecosystems, two alternative methods have been used to analyze changes of landscape attributes in a continuum: moving-window metrics and surface metrics (image texture). Here, we compare these two approaches for predicting richness of all plant species, legume species, legume trees, legume shrubs, legume forbs, and legume climbers across a tropical landscape in Mexico, based on the records of vascular plants in 250 10 x 10m plots. Multiple regression and variance partitioning methods were used to analyze the effects of the two landscape descriptors (moving-window and surface metrics), scale (400- and 200-m moving-window sides), and space (based on the extraction of principal coordinates of neighbor matrices' vectors) on species richness. The predictive power of all metrics was relatively small for total species richness, but generally higher for legume species. For legume forbs, surface metrics-based models indicated a direct association between species richness and landscape homogeneity. Moving-window metrics were highly sensitive to the biological group and to spatial scale, likely due to a leftover effect of image classification procedures. Conversely, surface metrics were more independent from scale and taxonomy. Attempts to predict species richness in highly diverse, low human-impacted tropical ecosystems more rapidly and accurately should better rely on surface metrics rather than on moving-window metrics, in line with the continuous landscape paradigm.

TI  - Enhanced land use/cover classification of heterogeneous tropical landscapes using support vector machines and textural homogeneity
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
AB  - Land use/cover classification is a key research field in remote sensing and land change science as thematic maps derived from remotely sensed data have become the basis for analyzing many socio-ecological issues. However, land use/cover classification remains a difficult task and it is especially challenging in heterogeneous tropical landscapes where nonetheless such maps are of great importance. The present study aims at establishing an efficient classification approach to accurately map all broad land use/cover classes in a large, heterogeneous tropical area, as a basis for further studies (e.g., land use/cover change, deforestation and forest degradation). Specifically, we first compare the performance of parametric (maximum likelihood), non-parametric (k-nearest neighbor and four different support vector machines - SVM), and hybrid (unsupervised-supervised) classifiers, using hard and soft (fuzzy) accuracy assessments. We then assess, using the maximum likelihood algorithm, what textural indices from the gray-level co-occurrence matrix lead to greater classification improvements at the spatial resolution of Landsat imagery (30 m), and rank them accordingly. Finally, we use the textural index that provides the most accurate classification results to evaluate whether its usefulness varies significantly with the classifier used. We classified imagery corresponding to dry and wet seasons and found that SVM classifiers outperformed all the rest. We also found that the use of some textural indices, but particularly homogeneity and entropy, can significantly improve classifications. We focused on the use of the homogeneity index, which has so far been neglected in land use/cover classification efforts, and found that this index along with reflectance bands significantly increased the overall accuracy of all the classifiers, but particularly of SVM. We observed that improvements in producer's and user's accuracies through the inclusion of homogeneity were different depending on land use/cover classes. Early-growth/degraded forests, pastures, grasslands and savanna were the classes most improved, especially with the SVM radial basis function and SVM sigmoid classifiers, though with both classifiers all land use/cover classes were mapped with producer's and user's accuracies of similar to 90%. Our classification approach seems very well suited to accurately map land use/cover of heterogeneous landscapes, thus having great potential to contribute to climate change mitigation schemes, conservation initiatives, and the design of management plans and rural development policies.

TI  - The Effect of Habitat Fragmentation and Species Diversity Loss on Hantavirus Prevalence in Panama
T2  - Animal Biodiversity and Emerging Diseases: Prediction and Prevention
CP  - 9th Biennial Conference on Animal Biodiversity and Emerging Diseases - Prediction and Prevention
AB  - Habitat fragmentation and diversity loss due to increased conversion of natural habitats to agricultural uses influence the distribution and abundance of wildlife species and thus may change the ecology of pathogen transmission. We used hantaviruses in Panama as a research model to determine whether anthropogenic environmental change is associated with changes in the dynamics of viral transmission. Specifically, we wanted to determine whether hantavirus infection was correlated with spatial attributes of the landscape at both large and small scales or whether these changes are mediated by changes in community composition. When analyzed at coarse spatial scales, hantavirus reservoirs were more commonly found in disturbed habitats and edge habitats than in forested areas. At local scales, reservoir species dominance was significantly correlated with the slope of the terrain. To evaluate the effect of small-mammal diversity loss on infection dynamics, we implemented an experiment with selective species removal at experimental sites. Seroprevalence of hantavirus was higher in the community of small mammals and increased through time in the experimental sites. The higher seroprevalence in experimental plots suggests that greater diversity likely reduces encounter rates between infected and susceptible hosts. Our studies suggest that habitat loss and fragmentation and species diversity loss are altering hantavirus infection dynamics in Panama. Our work represents a multidisciplinary approach toward disease research that includes biodiversity concerns such as environmental change and degradation, human settlement patterns, and the ecology of host and nonhost species, work that may be especially important in tropical countries.

TI  - Comparison of Statistical Modelling Approaches for Estimating Tropical Forest Aboveground Biomass Stock and Reporting Their Changes in Low-Intensity Logging Areas Using Multi-Temporal LiDAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Accurately quantifying forest aboveground biomass (AGB) is one of the most significant challenges in remote sensing, and is critical for understanding global carbon sequestration. Here, we evaluate the effectiveness of airborne LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) for monitoring AGB stocks and change (Delta AGB) in a selectively logged tropical forest in eastern Amazonia. Specifically, we compare results from a suite of different modelling methods with extensive field data. The calibration AGB values were derived from 85 square field plots sized 50 x 50 m field plots established in 2014 and which were estimated using airborne LiDAR data acquired in 2012, 2014, and 2017. LiDAR-derived metrics were selected based upon Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and used to estimate AGB stock and change. The statistical approaches were: ordinary least squares regression (OLS), and nine machine learning approaches: random forest (RF), several variations of k-nearest neighbour (k-NN), support vector machine (SVM), and artificial neural networks (ANN). Leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) was used to compare performance based upon root mean square error (RMSE) and mean difference (MD). The results show that OLS had the best performance with an RMSE of 46.94 Mg/ha (19.7%) and R-2 = 0.70. RF, SVM, and ANN were adequate, and all approaches showed RMSE <= 54.48 Mg/ha (22.89%). Models derived from k-NN variations all showed RMSE >= 64.61 Mg/ha (27.09%). The OLS model was thus selected to map AGB across the time-series. The mean (+/- sd-standard deviation) predicted AGB stock at the landscape level was 229.10 (+/- 232.13) Mg/ha in 2012, 258.18 (+/- 106.53) in 2014, and 240.34 (sd +/- 177.00) Mg/ha in 2017, showing the effect of forest growth in the first period and logging in the second period. In most cases, unlogged areas showed higher AGB stocks than logged areas. Our methods showed an increase in AGB in unlogged areas and detected small changes from reduced-impact logging (RIL) activities occurring after 2012. We also detected that the AGB increase in areas logged before 2012 was higher than in unlogged areas. Based on our findings, we expect our study could serve as a basis for programs such as REDD+ and assist in detecting and understanding AGB changes caused by selective logging activities in tropical forests.

TI  - Ross River virus and Barmah Forest virus infections: A review of history, ecology, and predictive models, with implications for tropical northern Australia
T2  - VECTOR-BORNE AND ZOONOTIC DISEASES
AB  - The purpose of the present article is to present a review of the Ross River virus (RRV) and Barmah Forest virus (BFV) literature in relation to potential implications for future disease in tropical northern Australia. Ross River virus infection is the most common and most widespread arboviral disease in Australia, with an average of 4,800 national notifications annually. Of recent concern is the sudden rise in BFV infections; the 2005-2006 summer marked the largest BFV epidemic on record in Australia, with 1,895 notifications. Although not life-threatening, infection with either virus can cause arthritis, myalgia, and fatigue for 6 months or longer, resulting in substantial morbidity and economic impact. The geographic distribution of mosquito species and their seasonal activity is determined in large part by temperature and rainfall. Predictive models can be useful tools in providing early warning systems for epidemics of RRV and BFV infection. Various models have been developed to predict RRV outbreaks, but these appear to be mostly only regionally valid, being dependent on local ecological factors. Difficulties have arisen in developing useful models for the tropical northern parts of Australia, and to date no models have been developed for the Northern Territory. Only one model has been developed for predicting BFV infections using climate and tide variables. It is predicted that the exacerbation of current greenhouse conditions will result in longer periods of high mosquito activity in the tropical regions where RRV and BFV are already common. In addition, the endemic locations may expand further within temperate regions, and epidemics may become more frequent in those areas. Further development of predictive models should benefit public health planning by providing early warning systems of RRV and BFV infection outbreaks in different geographical locations.

TI  - Machine Learning Classification of Endangered Tree Species in a Tropical Submontane Forest Using WorldView-2 Multispectral Satellite Imagery and Imbalanced Dataset
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Accurate maps of the spatial distribution of tropical tree species provide valuable insights for ecologists and forest management. The discrimination of tree species for economic, ecological, and technical reasons is usually necessary for achieving promising results in tree species mapping. Most of the data used in tree species mapping normally have some degree of imbalance. This study aimed to assess the effects of imbalanced data in identifying and mapping trees species under threat in a selectively logged sub-montane heterogeneous tropical forest using random forest (RF) and support vector machine with radial basis function (RBF-SVM) kernel classifiers and WorldView-2 multispectral imagery. For comparison purposes, the original imbalanced dataset was standardized using three data sampling techniques: oversampling, undersampling, and combined oversampling and undersampling techniques in R. The combined oversampling and undersampling technique produced the best results: F1-scores of 68.56 +/- 2.6% for RF and 64.64 +/- 3.4% for SVM. The balanced dataset recorded improved classification accuracy compared to the original imbalanced dataset. This research observed that more separable classes recorded higher F1-scores. Among the species, Syzygium guineense and Zanthoxylum gilletii were the most accurately mapped whereas Newtonia buchananii was the least accurately mapped. The most important spectral bands with the ability to detect and distinguish between tree species as measured by random forest classifier, were the Red, Red Edge, Near Infrared 1, and Near Infrared 2.

The disease is called Kyasanur Forest Disease [KFD] and the causal organism is Kyasanur Forest Disease Virus [KFDV], a flavivirus. KFD is classified as a tick-borne viral hemorrhagic fever, reporting 400 to 500 cases per year with a mortality rate of 2-10%. The virus exhibits genetic and clinical similarity with documented Alkhurma virus in Saudi Arabia, Russian encephalitis, Osmak hemorrhagic fever, documented in China as Nanjianyin virus. During year 2010, it open casted around the Egypt-Sudan region and It was found that this fever was also carried by arachnoid of Ornithodorids and other genera, and which parasitise sheep and camels. Despite the similarity with other viruses, KFDV remains endemic to Southwestern parts of India, especially to the Karnataka region of Malandu. however, having observed at recent cases reported in states such as Goa, Kerala, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu, the health and science departments have been keen to conduct further research on KFDV. The proposed research work is an attempt to spread the evidence-based knowledge and awareness of the disease and related research in the field.

TI  - Forest fragmentation and bacterial transmission among nonhuman primates, humans, and livestock, Uganda
T2  - EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB  - We conducted a prospective study of bacterial transmission among humans, nonhuman primates (primates hereafter), and livestock in western Uganda. Humans living near forest fragments harbored Escherichia coli bacteria that were approximate to 75% more similar to bacteria from primates in those fragments than to bacteria from primates in nearby undisturbed forests. Genetic similarity between human/ livestock and primate bacteria increased approximate to 3-fold as anthropogenic disturbance within forest fragments increased from moderate to high. Bacteria harbored by humans and livestock were approximately twice as similar to those of redtailed guenons, which habitually enter human settlements to raid crops, than to bacteria of other primate species. Tending livestock, experiencing gastrointestinal symptoms, and residing near a disturbed forest fragment increased genetic similarity between a participant's bacteria and those of nearby primates. Forest fragmentation, anthropogenic disturbance within fragments, primate ecology, and human behavior all influence bidirectional, interspecific bacterial transmission. Targeted interventions on any of these levels should reduce disease transmission and emergence.

TI  - Capture of <i>Alouatta guariba clamitans</i> for the surveillance of sylvatic yellow fever and zoonotic malaria: Which is the best strategy in the tropical Atlantic Forest?
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY
AB  - Howler monkey capture is an arduous and expensive task requiring trained and specialized professionals. We compared strategies and methods to most efficiently capture Alouatta guariba clamitans in remnants of the Atlantic Forest in Rio de Janeiro and its bordering states of Minas Gerais and Sao Paulo. We tested whether or not the success of expeditions in the forest with anesthetic darts, nets, and baited traps differed with and without the support of an information network, a contact chain built with key institutions and inhabitants to continuously monitor howler monkey presence. The influence of forest conditions (vegetation type and fragment size) upon darting success was also evaluated. We captured 24 free-living A. guariba clamitans. No howler monkey was caught with traps, probably due to the predominantly folivore feeding to high local plant diversity providing a great variety of food options. Captures based on an information network were significantly more efficient in terms of numbers of caught monkeys than without it. Captures with darts were considerably more efficient when performed in semideciduous forests and small forest fragments as opposed to ombrophilous forests or large woods. Although we walked great distances within the forest searching for howler monkeys, all but one animal were captured at the forest fringes. Hindrances to search and the darting method in the Atlantic Forest, for example, the steep terrain, high tree canopies, hunt pressure, and low A. guariba clamitans population density, were mitigated with the use of the information network in this monkey capture. Moreover, the information network enhanced the surveillance of zoonotic diseases, which howler monkeys and other nonhuman primates are reservoirs in Brazil, such as malaria and yellow fever.

TI  - Phylogenetic ecology applied to enrichment planting of tropical native tree species
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Enrichment planting within established plantations or secondary forests is a common strategy to enhance forest recovery, given that later successional forest species tend to have low dispersal and limited recruitment into these sites. It is difficult, however, to predict how species of seedlings will perform when planted under different overstory species. The field of phylogenetic ecology offers tools to help guide the selection of seedlings, drawing on the evolutionary conservatism of important functional traits. We evaluated the survival, growth, foliar disease, and herbivory of various native tropical tree seedlings at different evolutionary distances from monospecific stands of trees beneath which they were planted. We expected that seedlings planted under conspecific overstory trees would have low survival and growth and high percent foliar damage (as predicted by the Janzen-Connell Hypothesis), and that seedling performance would improve steadily with phylogenetic distance between seedling and overstory species. We found that seedlings planted under conspecific canopies had lower survivorship, reduced growth, and greater foliar damage than seedlings planted under canopies of different tree species. An overall increase in seedling performance with greater phylogenetic distance between seedling and overstory species was dominated by the contrast in performance between conspecific pairs and seedlings planted beneath extra-familial overstory species; but lack of available congeneric pairing limited inference about interactions among close relatives. Most pathogenic fungi isolated from enrichment-planted seedlings also caused disease when inoculated on the overstory tree species where the seedlings had been planted; this is consistent with overstory trees being an important reservoir of pathogens that affect seedlings. We conclude that enrichment planting with species more distantly related to those that dominate the canopy should enhance seedling's performance. Closer analysis at the congeneric level is warranted because of expected strong biotic interactions at close phylogenetic distances. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Tropical Cyclones Intensity Estimation by Feature Fusion and Random Forest Classifier Using Satellite Images
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Tropical cyclones (TCs) are natural threats that cause huge damage in coastal regions and adjacent areas. Prior indication of TC intensity can prevent this loss. Hence, the intensity estimation of TC became an important task to reduce the risk. This paper proposes features fusion and classification techniques using infrared satellite images for intensity estimation. Features of TC images are extracted from Gray Level Cooccurrence Matrix, Muli-Block Local Binary Pattern, and Geometric features. These feature extraction techniques are applied on labeled TC images of the North Indian Ocean to generate features vector. The size of the feature vector is reduced to 93% using a correlation-based feature subset selection mechanism. Further, these reduced feature vectors are fused to generate a fused feature vector by the information gain-based feature selection method and Min-Max normalization. The Random Forest classifier is used on this final fused feature vector to classify TC images above 93% accuracy.

TI  - Pervasive interactions between foliar microbes and soil nutrients mediate leaf production and herbivore damage in a tropical forest
T2  - NEW PHYTOLOGIST
AB  - Producing and retaining leaves underlie the performance and survivorship of seedlings in deeply shaded tropical forests. These habitats are characterized by conditions ideal for foliar bacteria, which can be potent plant pathogens. Leaf production, retention and susceptibility to enemies may ultimately depend upon interactions among soil nutrients and foliar microbes, yet this has never been tested.
   We experimentally evaluated the degree that foliar bacteria and soil resource supply mediate leaf dynamics for five common tree species (five different families) in a Panamanian forest. We reduced foliar bacteria with antibiotics for 29 months and measured leaf production, retention and damage for seedlings nested within a replicated 15-yr factorial nutrient enrichment experiment (nitrogen, N; phosphorus, P; potassium, K).
   Our results demonstrate that when we applied antibiotics, soil nutrients - particularly N - always regulated seedling leaf production (and to a lesser extent herbivore damage) for all five tree species. In addition, it was common for two macronutrients together to negate or completely reverse the impact of applying either one alone.
   Our findings of frequent plant-microbe-nutrient interactions are novel and suggest that these interactions may reinforce plant species-environment associations, thereby creating a fairly cryptic and fine-scale dimension of niche differentiation for coexisting tree species.

TI  - Incidence of Fungal Necrotrophic and Biotrophic Pathogens in Pioneer and Shade-tolerant Tropical Rain Forest Trees
T2  - BIOTROPICA
AB  - This study assessed the hypothesis that plant life history traits determine the incidence of fungal biotrophic and necrotrophic pathogens in pioneer vs. shade-tolerant tropical plant species. Considering that pioneer species mainly invest in induced defenses, we expected a negative relationship between the incidence of biotrophic and necrotrophic pathogens; in contrast, as shade-tolerant species invest heavily in constitutive defenses, we expected to find no correlation between the incidence of biotrophic and necrotrophic pathogens. These ideas were evaluated by assessing standing levels of fungal damage in a set of pioneer and shade-tolerant species from the Lacandona tropical rain forest (Mexico). The results showed that among pioneer plant species, leaves with biotrophic lesions were between 34 and 44 percent more abundant than those with necrotic lesions. In contrast, among shade-tolerant species, the proportions of leaves with necrotic lesions were 17-23 percent higher than those of leaves with injuries caused by biotrophic pathogens. Our study suggests that tropical tree species might present different defense strategies depending on the life-style of the pathogens that attack them, and the life history strategy of the attacked host plant species. Thus, the host constitutive and induced defenses, as well as the mechanisms used by different types of pathogens to circumvent those defenses maybe responsible for the patterns of attack observed in perennial tropical plants.

TI  - Closely related tree species support distinct communities of seed-associated fungi in a lowland tropical forest
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
AB  - Previous theoretical work has highlighted the potential for natural enemies to mediate the coexistence of species with similar life histories via density-dependent effects on survivorship. For plant pathogens to play this role, they must differ in their ability to infect or induce disease in different host plant species. In tropical forests characterized by high diversity, these effects must extend to phylogenetically closely related species pairs. Mortality at the seed and seedling stage strongly influences the abundance and distribution of tropical tree species, but the host preferences and spatial distributions of fungi are rarely determined.
   We examined how host species identity, relatedness and seed viability influence the composition of fungal communities associated with seeds of four co-occurring pioneer trees (Cecropia insignis, C. longipes, C. peltata and Jacaranda copaia). Seeds were buried in mesh bags in five common gardens in the understorey of a lowland tropical forest in Panama and retrieved at intervals from 1 to 30 months. A subset of the seeds in each bag was used to determine germination success. One half of each remaining seed was tested for viability; and the other half was used to culture and identify seed-infecting fungi.
   Seeds were infected by fungi after burial. Although fungal communities differed in viable versus dead seeds, and across burial locations, community composition primarily varied as a function of plant species identity (30.7% of variation in community composition vs. 4.5% for viability and location together), even for congeneric Cecropia species. Phylogenetic reconstruction showed that relatedness of fungi mostly reflected differences between Jacaranda (Bignoniaceae) and Cecropia (Urticaceae).
   Although the proportion of germinable seeds decreased gradually over time for all species, intraspecific variation in survival was high at the same location (e.g. ranging from 0% to 100% for C. peltata) suggesting variable exposure or susceptibility to seed pathogens.
   Synthesis. Our study provides evidence under field conditions that congeneric tree species with similar life history traits differ markedly in seed-associated fungal communities when exposed to the same soil-borne fungi. This is a critical first step supporting pathogen-mediated coexistence of closely related tree species.

TI  - MONITORING TROPICAL RAIN-FOREST MICROCLIMATE
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Singapore's original tropical rain forest cover has largely been removed, leaving only a total of 2700 hectares, or 5 percent of the island, under primary and secondary forest. This area in the center of the island is protected as water catchment and nature reserves in spite of intense pressure for development.
   The paper investigates the application of Landsat TM thermal data to surface temperature mapping in the vicinity of Singapore's forested central catchment area as an indication of the relative degree of disturbance to the original rainforest microclimate. This will assist in the designation of priority conservation status to areas which remain structurally and microclimatically viable as primary rain forest.
   Apparent temperatures were corrected for emissivity differences of different land-cover types. Pixel data were then input into a vector GIS and overlaid with existing coverages representing High Forest, Water, Urban Areas, and Elevation in order to examine the thermal characteristics of each land-cover type. Distinct spatial variations in thermal characteristics are observed to correspond to land-cover differences and to parameters of forest conservation value.

TI  - Diversity, distribution, abundance, and feeding pattern of tropical ornithophilic mosquitoes
T2  - JOURNAL OF VECTOR ECOLOGY
AB  - Bird-biting mosquitoes act as bridge vectors of diverse pathogens of emerging infectious diseases. In this study, we report for the first time the abundance, diversity, distribution, and feeding pattern of bird-biting mosquitoes on an island where avifaunal diversity is rich. Monthly mosquito collections were done at six different habitats in three different climatic zones using bird-baited traps over a year. Collected mosquitoes were identified using morphological and molecular tools. A total of 2,655 bird-biting mosquitoes of eight genera and 25 species were identified. Of these, 52% were Culex species, which represents 35% of the Culex species in the country. The most abundant species were Culex sitiens, Cx. pseudovishnui, Cx. nigropunctatus and Cx. quinquefasciatus, whereas the latter two were common to all habitats. The highest abundance was reported in lowland forests (49.6%), while it was lowest in highland forests (22.3%). Highest species similarity was reported from highland forests. Seasonal variations of the most abundant species were significantly different in selected habitats (p< 0.05). Two distinct biting peaks were identified, from 06:00 to 21:00 and 22:00 to 02:00. The biting nature of identified ornithophilic mosquitoes suggests the potential vector status of these mosquitoes.

TI  - Patterns of infection by intestinal parasites in sympatric howler monkey (<i>Alouatta palliata</i>) and spider monkey (<i>Ateles geoffroyi</i>) populations in a tropical dry forest in Costa Rica
T2  - PRIMATES
AB  - In primate populations, endoparasite species richness and prevalence are associated with host traits such as reproductive and social status, age, sex, host population density, and environmental factors such as humidity. We analyzed the species richness and prevalence of intestinal parasites in two sympatric primate populations, one of Alouatta palliata and one of Ateles geoffroyi, found in a tropical dry forest in Costa Rica. We identified three species of intestinal parasites (Controrchis sp., Trypanoxyuris sp., and Strongyloides sp.) in these two primate species. We did not find any differences in species richness between the primate species. However, the prevalences of Controrchis sp. and Trypanoxyuris sp. were higher in Alouatta palliata. Similarly, males and lactating females of Alouatta palliata showed higher Controrchis sp. prevalences. We did not observe any differences in parasite richness and prevalence between seasons. Infectious diseases in endangered primate populations must be considered in conservation strategies, especially when defining protected areas.

T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Accurate prediction of zoonotic spillover events requires a detailed understanding of baseline pathogens circulating in differing global environments. By characterizing the diversity and determining the natural baseline of pathogens in a given biological system, any perturbations to this balance can be detected, leading to estimates of risk for emerging diseases. As epidemics and probability for pandemics increase, there is a fundamental need for building global collaborations to fill gaps in the surveillance effort, especially to build remote in-county capacity and standardize timely sample processing and data analysis. To this point, a new consortium, the Remote Emerging Disease Intelligence-NETwork (REDI-NET) has been established to enhance surveillance approaches and characterize natural pathogens in temperate, tropical forest, and tropical grassland biomes. The REDI-NET is envisioned to be a long-term, phased initiative. All phases will integrate accompanying training resources such as videos reflecting SOPs and Quick Reference Guides. Routine bio- and xenosurveillance will facilitate the characterization of ecological parameters, enhance the accuracy of vector species identification using artificial intelligence technology, and guide the establishment of epidemiological risk thresholds critical for mitigating disease outbreaks in a timely manner. A key deliverable of the REDI-NET is a custom-designed electronically merged (e-MERGE) data pipeline and alert dashboard that integrates remotely captured data with state-of-the-art metagenomic next-generation sequencing technology. This pipeline incorporates data generated from field and laboratory best practices, to furnish health decision-makers with a centralized, timely, and rigorous database to efficiently search interdisciplinary and heterogeneous data sources necessary to alert, prepare and mitigate health threats. The e-MERGE pipeline, once fully established, will be a flexible, scalable, and expandable tool for varied health applications. Program success will result in an operational framework that addresses resource gaps in pathogen surveillance and enhances health protection with broad global applicability. The objective of this manuscript is to introduce the REDI-NET framework to anticipated stakeholders engaged in metagenomics, epidemiological surveillance, and One Health with a focus on Phase 1.

TI  - A mathematical model for zoonotic transmission of malaria in the Atlantic Forest: Exploring the effects of variations in vector abundance and acrodendrophily
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Transmission foci of autochthonous malaria caused by Plasmodium vivax-like parasites have frequently been reported in the Atlantic Forest in Southeastern and Southern Brazil. Evidence suggests that malaria is a zoonosis in these areas as human infections by simian Plasmodium species have been detected, and the main vector of malaria in the Atlantic Forest, Anopheles (Kerteszia) cruzii, can blood feed on human and simian hosts. In view of the lack of models that seek to predict the dynamics of zoonotic transmission in this part of the Atlantic Forest, the present study proposes a new deterministic mathematical model that includes a transmission compartment for non-human primates and parameters that take into account vector displacement between the upper and lower forest strata. The effects of variations in the abundance and acrodendrophily of An. cruzii on the prevalence of infected humans in the study area and the basic reproduction number (R-0) for malaria were analyzed. The model parameters are based on the literature and fitting of the empirical data. Simulations performed with the model indicate that (1) an increase in the abundance of the vector in relation to the total number of blood-seeking mosquitoes leads to an asymptotic increase in both the proportion of infected individuals at steady state and R-0; (2) the proportion of infected humans at steady state is higher when displacement of the vector mosquito between the forest strata increases; and (3) in most scenarios, Plasmodium transmission cannot be sustained only between mosquitoes and humans, which implies that non-human primates play an important role in maintaining the transmission cycle. The proposed model contributes to a better understanding of the dynamics of malaria transmission in the Atlantic Forest.
   Author summary
   The etiological agents of malaria are protozoa of the genus Plasmodium that are transmitted to humans and other vertebrate hosts by mosquitoes. In the Atlantic Forest in Southeastern and Southern Brazil, human infections by simian Plasmodium species have been detected, showing that in certain situations malaria can be transmitted zoonotically in this region. Anopheles cruzii, a sylvatic mosquito, is considered the main vector of malaria parasites in the Atlantic Forest. The fact that this species can feed on humans and monkeys reinforces the hypothesis of zoonotic transmission. Here we present a new mathematical model to explain the dynamics of zoonotic transmission of malaria in the Atlantic Forest. Simulations performed with the model showed that the prevalence of human cases and the basic reproduction number for malaria can be strongly influenced by variations in the abundance of An. cruzii and the frequency with which these mosquitoes move between the ground and the forest canopy to feed on humans and monkeys, respectively. The proposed model contributes to a better understanding of the dynamics of malaria transmission in the Atlantic Forest.

TI  - Deforestation and the spatio-temporal distribution of savannah and forest members of the <i>Simulium damnosum</i> complex in southern Ghana and south-western Togo
T2  - TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Spatio-temporal data on cytotaxonomic identifications of larvae of different members of the Simulium damnosum complex collected from rivers in southern Ghana and south-western Togo from 1975 until 1997 were analysed. When the data were combined, the percentages of savannah blackflies (S. damnosum sensu stricto and S. sirbanum) in the samples were shown to have been progressively increasing since 1975. The increases were statistically significant (P < 0.001), but the rates of increase were not linear. Further analyses were conducted according to the collection seasons and locations of the samples, to account for possible biases such as savannah flies occurring further south in the dry season or a preponderance of later samples from northern rivers having more savannah flies. These analyses showed that the increasing trend was statistically significant (P< 0.0001) only during the periods April to June and October to December. The presence of adult savannah flies carrying infective larvae (L3) indistinguishable from those of Onchocerca volvulus in the study zone was confirmed by examinations of captured flies. The percentages of savannah flies amongst the human-biting populations and the percentages with L3s in the head were higher during dry seasons than wet seasons and the savannah species were found furthest south (5degrees25'N) in the dry season. Comparisons of satellite images taken in 1973 and 1990 over a study area in south-western Ghana encompassing stretches of the Tano and Bia rivers demonstrated that there have been substantial increases in urban and savannah areas, at the expense of forest. This was so not only for the whole images but also for subsamples of the images taken at 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 km distant from sites alongside the River Tano. At every distance from the river, the percentages of pixels classified as urban or savannah have increased in 1990 compared with 1973, while those classified as degraded or dense forest have decreased. The possibility that the proportionate increases in savannah forms of the vectors of onchocerciasis, and hence in the likelihood of the transmission of savannah strains of the disease in formerly forested areas, were related to the decreases in forest cover is discussed.

TI  - Unlocking the potential of hyperspectral and LiDAR for above-ground biomass (AGB) and tree species classification in tropical forests
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
AB  - Tree species classification using a combination of airborne hyperspectral and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) can provide valuable and effective methods for forest management, such as planning and monitoring purposes. However, only a few studies have applied tree species classification using both combinations in the tropical forest. The research takes a comparative classification approach to examine several classifiers using airborne hyperspectral in the tropical forest. In addition, Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) method was applied on hyperspectral data to extract the crown of individual tree species for classification and estimation purposes. Minimum Noise Fraction Transform (MNF) was applied to reduce the data dimensionality and different training samples from the various species used in this study. The result shows that Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) achieved the highest overall accuracy above 50% compared to other classifiers in the tropical forest. Besides, LiDAR data was also used to estimate individual trees' height for all species in the study area. The multiple coefficients of determination (R-2) test result between LiDAR and field observation data in eight years gaps is 0.754. Therefore, Above-Ground Biomass (AGB) and carbon stock will estimate using a combination of LiDAR, hyperspectral, and field observation data for individual tree species. This method has proven to provide the required information for forest planning and generation in a short time, especially in tree species identification, AGB, and carbon stock estimation in tropical forests.

TI  - Synergistic evaluation of Sentinel 1 and 2 for biomass estimation in a tropical forest of India
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
AB  - Spatially explicit measurement of Above Ground Biomass (AGB) is crucial for the quantification of forest carbon stock and fluxes. To achieve this, an integration of Optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite datasets could provide an accurate estimation of forest biomass. This will also help in removing the uncertainties associated with the single sensor-based estimation approaches. Therefore, the present study attempts to integrate Sentinel-2 optical data with Sentinel-1 SAR dataset to estimate AGB in the Shoolpaneshwar Wildlife Sanctuary (SWS), Gujarat, India. In this study, two non-parametric machine learning algorithms viz Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with different kernel functions-linear, sigmoidal, radial and polynomial and Random Forest (RF) were employed for the prediction of AGB using different combinations of VV, VH, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Incidence Angle (IA). Ground based AGB was estimated through allometric equation at 35 sampling sites with the help of tree height and Diameter at Breast's Height (DBH). Standalone collinearity analysis among different parameters resulted in poor correlation of AGB with VH (r = 0.05) and IA (r = 0.015), whereas a significantly good correlation with NDVI (r = 0.80) and VV (r = 0.74) were observed. Inclusion of NDVI with VV and VH together also resulted in a better correlation (r = 0.85) than other combinations. The SVM with linear kernel utilizing parametric the combinations of VV + VH + NDVI and VV + VH + NDVI + IA were found to be best performing on the basis of evaluation metrics. The outcome of this study highlighted the significance of machine learning techniques and synergistic use of different remote data for an AGB in forests.

TI  - Reduced impact logging road issues in tropical forests
T2  - TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
AB  - Road design, construction, and maintenance practices need to be significantly improved in many logging operations being undertaken in tropical forests worldwide. Reduced impact logging is a program designed to achieve more cost-effective and sustainable logging practices through good stand inventories, sound silvicultural practices, less waste and damage in the operations, and replanting where necessary. The program also involves design and construction of improved logging roads. Many roads being constructed and used today are poorly built, poorly drained, and poorly maintained. Resulting impacts include unnecessarily high road costs, inefficient logging operations, and significant negative environmental impacts. Little consideration is given to long-term or full life-cycle costs of the roads. These are not new problems. The objectives of this paper are to identify ongoing common problems and recommend practical solutions, reiterate the need for good basic engineering practices, and highlight some of the negative impacts of poor engineering practices. Key problems that appear to cause unnecessarily high road costs and inefficient logging operations include inadequate road surface drainage, excessively wide roads and roads built under inconsistent design standards, inadequate use of available road surfacing materials, inadequate road maintenance, and poor road location and the subsequent need for road reconstruction. A variety of other road drainage, materials, and erosion control issues also need improving. Social and environmental issues related to roads and their access include colonization and development along the road corridor, illegal logging and subsequent deforestation, bush meat hunting and wildlife depletion, spread of diseases, and other land use changes. Road management and access control are needed along with improved design, construction, and maintenance practices.

TI  - Effect of habitat fragmentation on rural house invasion by sylvatic triatomines: A multiple landscape-scale approach
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - After the decrease of the relative importance of Triatoma infestans, a number of studies reported the occurrence of sylvatic triatomines dispersing actively to domestic environments in the dry western Chaco Region of Argentina. Anthropic modification of the landscape is mentioned as one of the main causes of the increase in domicile invasion. The aim of this study was to describe the occurrence and frequency of sylvatic triatomines invading rural houses, and to evaluate the effect of habitat fragmentation and other ecological factors on the invasion of rural houses in central Argentina. We hypothesized that the decrease in food sources and the loss of wild ecotopes, as a consequence of habitat fragmentation, increase the chances of invasion by triatomines. The entomological data was collected by community-based vector surveillance during fieldwork carried out between 2017-2020, over 131 houses located in fourteen rural communities in the northwest of Cordoba Province (central Argentina). We used generalized linear models to evaluate the effect of (i) the environmental anthropic disturbance in the study area, (ii) the composition and configuration of the landscape surrounding the house, (iii) the spatial arrangement of houses, (iv) and the availability of artificial refuges and domestic animals in the peridomicile, on house invasion by triatomines. We report the occurrence of seven species of triatomines invading rural houses in the study area -T. infestans, T. guasayana, T. garciabesi, T. platensis, T. delpontei, T. breyeri and P. guentheri-. Study data suggest that invasion by triatomines occurs with higher frequency in disturbed landscapes, with houses spatially isolated and in proximity to subdivided fragments of forest. The availability of domestic refuges in the peridomestic structures as well as the presence of a higher number of domestic animals increase the chances of invasion by triatomines.
   Author summary Triatoma infestans is the main vector of Trypanosoma cruzi, the causal agent of Chagas disease in the southern cone countries of South America. A number of sylvatic species of triatomines have been reported dispersing actively into man-made habitats. The study of the ecological mechanisms associated with the active dispersion of sylvatic triatomines into domestic environments becomes relevant in terms of the potential risk of T. cruzi introduction from the wild cycle into the domestic transmission cycle. Anthropic modification of the landscape is mentioned as one of the possible causes of the increase in the active dispersion, due to the negative impact of habitat fragmentation on the availability of food sources (populations of birds and mammals) and wild ecotopes for sylvatic triatomines. Before the present study there have been no evidences testing this hypothesis. Previous authors focused on determining the effect of environmental disturbance considering one geographical scale. In this article we describe the occurrence and frequency of sylvatic triatomines invasion into rural houses, and discuss the effect of habitat fragmentation considering a multiple landscape-scale approach. This approach allowed testing the effect of compositional and configurational landscape properties around the house and environmental anthropic disturbance, among other ecological factors.

TI  - Biodiversity Can Help Prevent Malaria Outbreaks in Tropical Forests
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background: Plasmodium vivax is a widely distributed, neglected parasite that can cause malaria and death in tropical areas. It is associated with an estimated 80-300 million cases of malaria worldwide. Brazilian tropical rain forests encompass host- and vector-rich communities, in which two hypothetical mechanisms could play a role in the dynamics of malaria transmission. The first mechanism is the dilution effect caused by presence of wild warm-blooded animals, which can act as dead-end hosts to Plasmodium parasites. The second is diffuse mosquito vector competition, in which vector and nonvector mosquito species compete for blood feeding upon a defensive host. Considering that the World Health Organization Malaria Eradication Research Agenda calls for novel strategies to eliminate malaria transmission locally, we used mathematical modeling to assess those two mechanisms in a pristine tropical rain forest, where the primary vector is present but malaria is absent.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: The Ross-Macdonald model and a biodiversity-oriented model were parameterized using newly collected data and data from the literature. The basic reproduction number (R-0) estimated employing Ross-Macdonald model indicated that malaria cases occur in the study location. However, no malaria cases have been reported since 1980. In contrast, the biodiversity-oriented model corroborated the absence of malaria transmission. In addition, the diffuse competition mechanism was negatively correlated with the risk of malaria transmission, which suggests a protective effect provided by the forest ecosystem. There is a non-linear, unimodal correlation between the mechanism of dead-end transmission of parasites and the risk of malaria transmission, suggesting a protective effect only under certain circumstances (e. g., a high abundance of wild warm-blooded animals).
   Conclusions/Significance: To achieve biological conservation and to eliminate Plasmodium parasites in human populations, the World Health Organization Malaria Eradication Research Agenda should take biodiversity issues into consideration.

TI  - Environmental Synergisms and Extinctions of Tropical Species
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
AB  - Environmental synergisms may pose the greatest threat to tropical biodiversity. Using recently updated data sets from the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List, we evaluated the incidence of perceived threats to all known mammal, bird, and amphibian species in tropical forests. Vulnerable, endangered, and extinct species were collectively far more likely to be imperiled by combinations of threats than expected by chance. Among 45 possible pairwise combinations of 10 different threats, 69%, 93%, and 71% were significantly more frequent than expected for threatened mammals, birds, and amphibians, respectively, even with a stringent Bonferroni-corrected probability value (p = 0.003). Based on this analysis, we identified five key environmental synergisms in the tropics and speculate on the existence of others. The most important involve interactions between habitat loss or alteration (from agriculture, urban sprawl, infrastructure, or logging) and other anthropogenic disturbances such as hunting, fire, exotic-species invasions, or pollution. Climatic change and emerging pathogens also can interact with other threats. We assert that environmental synergisms are more likely the norm than the exception for threatened species and ecosystems, can vary markedly in nature among geographic regions and taxa, and may be exceedingly difficult to predict in terms of their ultimate impacts. The perils posed by environmental synergisms highlight the need for a precautionary approach to tropical biodiversity conservation.

TI  - Tropical Forest Fire Susceptibility Mapping at the Cat Ba National Park Area, Hai Phong City, Vietnam, Using GIS-Based Kernel Logistic Regression
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - The Cat Ba National Park area (Vietnam) with its tropical forest is recognized as being part of the world biodiversity conservation by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and is a well-known destination for tourists, with around 500,000 travelers per year. This area has been the site for many research projects; however, no project has been carried out for forest fire susceptibility assessment. Thus, protection of the forest including fire prevention is one of the main concerns of the local authorities. This work aims to produce a tropical forest fire susceptibility map for the Cat Ba National Park area, which may be helpful for the local authorities in forest fire protection management. To obtain this purpose, first, historical forest fires and related factors were collected from various sources to construct a GIS database. Then, a forest fire susceptibility model was developed using Kernel logistic regression. The quality of the model was assessed using the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, area under the ROC curve (AUC), and five statistical evaluation measures. The usability of the resulting model is further compared with a benchmark model, the support vector machine (SVM). The results show that the Kernel logistic regression model has a high level of performance in both the training and validation dataset, with a prediction capability of 92.2%. Since the Kernel logistic regression model outperforms the benchmark model, we conclude that the proposed model is a promising alternative tool that should also be considered for forest fire susceptibility mapping in other areas. The results of this study are useful for the local authorities in forest planning and management.

TI  - ATLANTIC-PRIMATES: a dataset of communities and occurrences of primates in the Atlantic Forests of South America
T2  - ECOLOGY
AB  - Primates play an important role in ecosystem functioning and offer critical insights into human evolution, biology, behavior, and emerging infectious diseases. There are 26 primate species in the Atlantic Forests of South America, 19 of them endemic. We compiled a dataset of 5,472 georeferenced locations of 26 native and 1 introduced primate species, as hybrids in the genera Callithrix and Alouatta. The dataset includes 700 primate communities, 8,121 single species occurrences and 714 estimates of primate population sizes, covering most natural forest types of the tropical and subtropical Atlantic Forest of Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina and some other biomes. On average, primate communities of the Atlantic Forest harbor 2 +/- 1 species (range = 1-6). However, about 40% of primate communities contain only one species. Alouatta guariba (N = 2,188 records) and Sapajus nigritus (N = 1,127) were the species with the most records. Callicebus barbarabrownae (N = 35), Leontopithecus caissara (N = 38), and Sapajus libidinosus (N = 41) were the species with the least records. Recorded primate densities varied from 0.004 individuals/km(2) (Alouatta guariba at Fragmento do Bugre, Parana, Brazil) to 400 individuals/km(2) (Alouatta caraya in Santiago, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil). Our dataset reflects disparity between the numerous primate census conducted in the Atlantic Forest, in contrast to the scarcity of estimates of population sizes and densities. With these data, researchers can develop different macroecological and regional level studies, focusing on communities, populations, species co-occurrence and distribution patterns. Moreover, the data can also be used to assess the consequences of fragmentation, defaunation, and disease outbreaks on different ecological processes, such as trophic cascades, species invasion or extinction, and community dynamics. There are no copyright restrictions. Please cite this Data Paper when the data are used in publications. We also request that researchers and teachers inform us of how they are using the data.

TI  - Determinants of deforestation in Nepal's Central Development Region
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - The process of deforestation in the Central Development Region (CDR) of Nepal is diverse in space and time, with rapid deforestation still occurring in areas outside the national parks and wildlife reserves. This paper identifies the spatial driving forces (SDFs) of deforestation in the CDR for 1975-2000 using satellite data of 1975 (MSS), 1990 (TM), and 2000 (ETM+) along with socio-demographic and socioeconomic variables. Radiometrically calibrated satellite images are individually classified into seven distinct classes and merged together to cover the entire CDR. Classification accuracies are also assessed. Areas of land use and cover within the areas of each Village Development Committee (VDC) and municipality represented by GIS polygons are calculated from the classified images by overlaying vector files of 1845 polygons representing sections of VDCs and municipalities in 30-1199 m, 1200-2399 m, 2400-4999 m and >5000 m elevation levels. These elevation levels were estimated from the DEM compiled from 24 ASTER scenes taken on different dates. Only the first three elevation levels are used in the analysis because area >5000 m is under permanent snow cover where human related forestry activities are almost negligible. A transition matrix is generated for 1975-1990 using classified images of 1975 and 1990 and then this product is used to further develop another transition matrix for 1990-2000 with the classified ETM+ 2000 images as the final stage. The GIS polygon layer is overlaid on the transition matrices to calculate deforestation areas for 1975-1990 and 1990-2000. Biophysical and socioeconomic information collected from various sources is then brought into a GIS platform for statistical analyses. Six linear regression models are estimated using SAS; in effects two models for each elevation range representing the 1975-1990 and 1990-2000 periods of change to identify SDF influences on deforestation. These regression analyses reveal that deforestation in the CDR is related to multiple factors, such as farming population, genders of various ages, migration, elevation, road, distance from road to forest, meandering and erosion of river, and most importantly the conversion of forestland into farmland.

TI  - MULTITEMPORAL MONITORING OF THE FOREST COVER IN COTE D'IVOIRE FROM THE 1960S TO THE 2000S, USING LANDSAT SATELLITE IMAGES
T2  - 2016 IEEE INTERNATIONAL GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING SYMPOSIUM (IGARSS)
CP  - 36th IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)
AB  - The phenomenon of deforestation is a reality in Cote d'Ivoire, which dates back to the colonial period [1]. This study aims to determine the spatial and temporal evolution of dense rainforests using remote sensing data. Many previous studies have attempted to determine the area of forest cover in Cote d'Ivoire ([2], [3], [4], [5], [6] and [7]). Most of these studies were conducted from either aerial photographs or satellite images of low spatial resolutions such as NOAA/AV HRR [8]. However, through these studies, methods of estimates of the area of forest cover generally vary from one author to another, thus causing an inconsistency in the results [9].
   Remote sensing allows a better assessment of the scope and scale of the problem of deforestation. Using multi-temporal data, one can better detect and analyze changes in the forest cover. By comparing images of previous years with recent scenes, it becomes possible to effectively measure the differences in the extent of deforestation and loss of rainforests in Cote d'Ivoire ([10] and [11]). In a fIrst phase, the country' s dense forest cover of the 1960s was determined from the digitization of existing vegetation map. In a second phase, the dense forest cover of the 1980s and 2000s were obtained by processing of Landsat TM and ETM+ satellite images. First the geometric correction of the satellite images was performed. Then, series of supervised classifIcations based on the maximum likelihood method were done to generate maps of land cover, with overall accuracies of 90%. From these land cover maps, the class of dense forests was extracted and converted into a map layer in vector format. By crossing dense forests covers of the 1980s and 2000 with those of the 1960s, the specific characterizations of those forests were derived (Figure 1, 2, 3). The results show a dense humid forest cover of about 8.4 million ha in 1960, with the presence of large blocks. The 1980s and 2000s have dense forest cover of 2.6 million ha and l. 35 million ha, respectively (Tables 1, 2, 3). These latter periods are characterized by high loss and fragmentation of rainforests in Cote d'Ivoire. Thus, since its independence, the country has lost more than 80% of its forest cover. The results of this study show that clearing associated with industrial agriculture mainly cocoa, coffee and rubber farming as well as demographic pressure and abusive exploitation of valuable wood species for export are the main causes of deforestation in Cote d'Ivoire. This study advocates the restoration of forests through the implementation of an awareness policy and reforestation one hand, and an efficient monitoring and protection of national protected areas and parks.

TI  - Habitat fragmentation differentially shapes neutral and immune gene variation in a tropical bird species
T2  - HEREDITY
AB  - Habitat fragmentation is a major cause of biodiversity loss, responsible for an alteration of intraspecific patterns of neutral genetic diversity and structure. Although neutral genetic variation can be informative for demographic inferences, it may be a poor predictor of adaptive genetic diversity and thus of the consequences of habitat fragmentation on selective evolutionary processes. In this context, we contrasted patterns of genetic diversity and structure of neutral loci (microsatellites) and immune genes (i.e., toll-like receptors) in an understorey bird species, the wedge-billed woodcreeperGlyphorynchus spirurus. The objectives were (1) to investigate forest fragmentation effects on population genetic diversity, (2) to disentangle the relative role of demography (genetic drift and migration) and selection, and (3) to assess whether immunogenetic patterns could be associated with variation of ectoparasite (i.e., ticks) pressures. Our results revealed an erosion of neutral genetic diversity and a substantial genetic differentiation among fragmented populations, resulting from a decrease in landscape connectivity and leading to the divergence of distinct genetic pools at a small spatial scale. Patterns of genetic diversity observed for TLR4 and TLR5 were concordant with neutral genetic patterns, whereas those observed for TLR3 and TLR21 were discordant. This result underlines that the dominant evolutionary force shaping immunogenetic diversity (genetic drift vs. selection) may be different depending on loci considered. Finally, tick prevalence was higher in fragmented environments. We discussed the hypothesis that pathogen selective pressures may contribute to maintain adaptive genetic diversity despite the negative demographic effect of habitat fragmentation on neutral genetic diversity.

TI  - Seed Dispersal Distances and Plant Migration Potential in Tropical East Asia
T2  - BIOTROPICA
AB  - Most predictions of vegetation responses to anthropogenic climate change over the next 100 yr are based on plant physiological tolerances and do not account for the ability of plant species to migrate over the distances required in the time available, or the impact of habitat fragmentation on this ability. This review assesses the maximum routine dispersal distances achievable in tropical East Asia and their vulnerability to human impacts. Estimates for various plant-vector combinations range from < 10 m, for species dispersed by ants or mechanical means, to > 10 km for some species dispersed by wind (tiny seeds), water, fruit pigeons, large fruit bats (tiny seeds), elephants, rhinoceroses, and people. Most plant species probably have maximum dispersal distances in the 100-1000 m range, but the widespread, canopy-dominant Dipterocarpaceae and Fagaceae are normally dispersed < 100 m. Large fruit bats and fruit pigeons are particularly important for long-distance dispersal in fragmented landscapes and should be protected from hunting. The maximum seed dispersal distances estimated in this study are potentially sufficient for many plant species to track temperature changes in steep topography, but are far too small for a significant role in mitigating climate change impacts in the lowlands, where temperature and rainfall gradients are much more shallow.

TI  - Multifunctional shade-tree management in tropical agroforestry landscapes - a review
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - P>1. Agricultural intensification reduces ecological resilience of land-use systems, whereas paradoxically, environmental change and climate extremes require a higher response capacity than ever. Adaptation strategies to environmental change include maintenance of shade trees in tropical agroforestry, but conversion of shaded to unshaded systems is common practice to increase short-term yield.
   2. In this paper, we review the short-term and long-term ecological benefits of shade trees in coffee Coffea arabica, C. canephora and cacao Theobroma cacao agroforestry and emphasize the poorly understood, multifunctional role of shade trees for farmers and conservation alike.
   3. Both coffee and cacao are tropical understorey plants. Shade trees in agroforestry enhance functional biodiversity, carbon sequestration, soil fertility, drought resistance as well as weed and biological pest control. However, shade is needed for young cacao trees only and is less important in older cacao plantations. This changing response to shade regime with cacao plantation age often results in a transient role for shade and associated biodiversity in agroforestry.
   4. Abandonment of old, unshaded cacao in favour of planting young cacao in new, thinned forest sites can be named 'short-term cacao boom-and-bust cycle', which counteracts tropical forest conservation. In a 'long-term cacao boom-and-bust cycle', cacao boom can be followed by cacao bust due to unmanageable pest and pathogen levels (e.g. in Brazil and Malaysia). Higher pest densities can result from physiological stress in unshaded cacao and from the larger cacao area planted. Risk-averse farmers avoid long-term vulnerability of their agroforestry systems by keeping shade as an insurance against insect pest outbreaks, whereas yield-maximizing farmers reduce shade and aim at short-term monetary benefits.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Sustainable agroforestry management needs to conserve or create a diverse layer of multi-purpose shade trees that can be pruned rather than removed when crops mature. Incentives from payment-for-ecosystem services and certification schemes encourage farmers to keep high to medium shade tree cover. Reducing pesticide spraying protects functional agrobiodiversity such as antagonists of pests and diseases, pollinating midges determining cacao yields and pollinating bees enhancing coffee yield. In a landscape perspective, natural forest alongside agroforestry allows noncrop-crop spillover of a diversity of functionally important organisms. Knowledge transfer between farmers, agronomists and ecologists in a participatory approach helps to encourage a shade management regime that balances economic and ecological needs and provides a 'diversified food-and-cash crop' livelihood strategy.

TI  - Patent landscape of neglected tropical diseases: an analysis of worldwide patent families
T2  - GLOBALIZATION AND HEALTH
AB  - Background: "Neglected Tropical Diseases" (NTDs) affect millions of people in Africa, Asia and South America. The two primary ways of strategic interventions are "preventive chemotherapy and transmission control" (PCT), and "innovative and intensified disease management" (IDM). In the last 5 years, phenomenal progress has been achieved. However, it is crucial to intensify research effort into NTDs, because of the emerging drug resistance. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the term NTDs covers 17 diseases, namely buruli ulcer, Chagas disease, dengue, dracunculiasis, echinococcosis, trematodiasis, human African trypanosomiasis, leishmaniasis, leprosy, lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, rabies, schistosomiasis, soil-transmitted helminthes, taeniasis, trachoma, and yaws. The aim of this study is to map out research and development (R&D) landscape through patent analysis of these identified NTDs. To achieve this, analysis and evaluation have been conducted on patenting trends, current legal status of patent families, priority countries by earliest priority years and their assignee types, technological fields of patent families over time, and original and current patent assignees.
   Main body: Patent families were extracted from Patseer, an international database of patents from over 100 patent issuing authorities worldwide. Evaluation of the patents was carried out using the combination of different search terms related to each identified NTD. In this paper, a total number of 12,350 patent families were analyzed. The main countries with sources of inventions were identified to be the United States (US) and China. The main technological fields covered by NTDs patent landscape are pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, organic fine chemistry, analysis of biological materials, basic materials chemistry, and medical technology. Governmental institutions and universities are the primary original assignees. Among the NTDs, leishmaniasis, dengue, and rabies received the highest number of patent families, while human African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness), taeniasis, and dracunciliasis received the least. The overall trend of patent families shows an increase between 1985 and 2008, and followed by at least 6 years of stagnation.
   Conclusion: The filing pattern of patent families analyzed undoubtedly reveals slow progress on research and development of NTDs. Involving new players, such as non-governmental organizations may help to mitigate and reduce the burden of NTDs.

TI  - Machine learning for carbon stock prediction in a tropical forest in Southeastern Brazil
T2  - BOSQUE
AB  - The increasing awareness of global climate change has drawn attention to the role of forests as mitigators of this process as they act as carbon sinks to the atmosphere. Understanding the process of carbon storage in forests and its drivers, as well as presenting consistent models for their estimation, is a current demand. In this sense, the aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of machine learning techniques: support vector machines (SVM) and to propose a new nonlinear model extracted from the training of an artificial neural network (ANN) in the modeling of above ground carbon stock in a secondary semideciduous forest. SVM and ANN construction and training process considered independent variables selected by stepwise: minimum DBH (diameter of breast height - 1.3 m), maximum DBH, mean DBH, total height and number of trees, all by plot. SVM and the model extracted from ANN were applied to the data set intended for validation. Both techniques presented satisfactory performance in modeling carbon stock by plot, with homogeneous distribution and low dispersion of residues and predicted values close to those observed. Analysis criteria indicated superior performance of the model extracted from the artificial neural network, which presented a mean relative error of 6.94 %, while the support vector machine presented 13.52 %, combined with lower bias values and higher correlation between predictions and observations.

TI  - Tropical arthritogenic alphaviruses
T2  - REUMATOLOGIA CLINICA
AB  - Tropical alphaviruses have special tropism for bone and joint tissue. Patients can develop chronic rheumatic disorders similar to rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. The prototype is Chikungunya virus, although other lesser known viruses in our environment such as Sindbis, Ross River, Mayaro, O'nyong nyong and Barmah Forest viruses have the potential to be sped through vectors and cause chronic rheumatic disease.
   International population movements have increased the numbers of patients diagnosed with these tropical viruses in areas in which they are not endemic. Since they can leave persistent symptoms and affect the quality of life of the patients, it is important that we be aware of them. Changes in ecosystems have favored the expansion of competent mosquitoes, making fears of local transmission in southern Europe a reality.
   The objective of this review is to provide a clinical approach to the different arthritogenic tropical alphaviruses, especially those in which chronic rheumatic disease is more frequent.

TI  - Tropical diseases: the burden and its implications
T2  - SCHWEIZERISCHE MEDIZINISCHE WOCHENSCHRIFT
CP  - Annual Meeting of the Swiss-Society-of-Tropical-Medicine-and-Parasitology
AB  - The weight of disease in developing countries may be viewed as a burden? but it also provides opportunities and challenges in research, practical and altruistic action and ecological understanding. Of the classical parasitic diseases, 10 are to be found in the top 100 major diseases in the world. The burden of tropical diseases is much greater in Africa, with far fewer resources available. Infectious diseases are combined with diseases of poverty. High fertility, slow economic growth, deforestation, rapid urbanization and increased migration contribute to the recent changes in transmission and distribution of diseases observed in developing countries. The burden of diseases in tropical and developing countries remains massive. New, especially molecular, parasitological techniques and lines of research, and scientific methods for investigations and management of tropical diseases can contribute to the reduction of the burden of disease while providing a better understanding of parasites and their interactions with their hosts.

TI  - An Ethnographic Approach to Characterizing Potential Pathways of Zoonotic Disease Transmission from Wild Meat in Guyana
T2  - ECOHEALTH
AB  - The hunting, butchery, and consumption of wild meat is an important interface for zoonotic disease transmission. Despite this, few researchers have used ethnography to understand the sociocultural factors that may increase zoonotic disease transmission from hunting, particularly in Amazonia. Here, we use ethnographic methods consisting of structured, semi-structured and unstructured interviews, and participant observation to address questions pertaining to wild meat consumption, pathways of zoonotic disease transmission, food security, and the cultural identity of indigenous Waiwai in the Konashen Community Owned Conservation Area, Guyana. Our data revealed that the majority of Waiwai eat wild meat two to three times/week and 60% of respondents reported butchery-related injuries. However, semi-structured and unstructured interviews, and participant observation data indicate that the Waiwai do not perceive most cuts from butchery as injuries, despite being a potential route of pathogen exposure. Additionally, participant observation revealed that hunting is integral to Waiwai identity and the Waiwai exhibit a cultural aversion to domestic meats. These findings provide valuable insights into the interplay of hunting and wild meat consumption and disease in Amazonia and demonstrate how an ethnographic approach provides the contextual data necessary for identifying potential pathways of zoonotic transmission from wild meat.

TI  - Park isolation in anthropogenic landscapes: land change and livelihoods at park boundaries in the African Albertine Rift
T2  - REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
AB  - Landscapes are changing rapidly in regions where rural people live adjacent to protected parks and reserves. This is the case in highland East Africa, where many parks are increasingly isolated in a matrix of small farms and settlements. In this review, we synthesize published findings and extant data sources to assess the processes and outcomes of park isolation, with a regional focus on people's livelihoods at park boundaries in the Ugandan Albertine Rift. The region maintains exceptionally high rural population density and growth and is classified as a global biodiversity hotspot. In addition to the impacts of increasing numbers of people, our synthesis highlights compounding factors-changing climate, increasing land value and variable tenure, and declining farm yields-that accelerate effects of population growth on park isolation and widespread landscape change. Unpacking these processes at the regional scale identifies outcomes of isolation in the unprotected landscape-high frequency of human-wildlife conflict, potential for zoonotic disease transmission, land and resource competition, and declining wildlife populations in forest fragments. We recommend a strategy for the management of isolated parks that includes augmenting outreach by park authorities and supporting community needs in the human landscape, for example through healthcare services, while also maintaining hard park boundaries through traditional protectionism. Even in cases where conservation refers to biodiversity in isolated parks, landscape strategies must include an understanding of the local livelihood context in order to ensure long-term sustainable biodiversity protection.

TI  - Tree Species Abundance Predictions in a Tropical Agricultural Landscape with a Supervised Classification Model and Imbalanced Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Mapping species through classification of imaging spectroscopy data is facilitating research to understand tree species distributions at increasingly greater spatial scales. Classification requires a dataset of field observations matched to the image, which will often reflect natural species distributions, resulting in an imbalanced dataset with many samples for common species and few samples for less common species. Despite the high prevalence of imbalanced datasets in multiclass species predictions, the effect on species prediction accuracy and landscape species abundance has not yet been quantified. First, we trained and assessed the accuracy of a support vector machine (SVM) model with a highly imbalanced dataset of 20 tropical species and one mixed-species class of 24 species identified in a hyperspectral image mosaic (350-2500 nm) of Panamanian farmland and secondary forest fragments. The model, with an overall accuracy of 62% +/- 2.3% and F-score of 59% +/- 2.7%, was applied to the full image mosaic (23,000 ha at a 2-m resolution) to produce a species prediction map, which suggested that this tropical agricultural landscape is more diverse than what has been presented in field-based studies. Second, we quantified the effect of class imbalance on model accuracy. Model assessment showed a trend where species with more samples were consistently over predicted while species with fewer samples were under predicted. Standardizing sample size reduced model accuracy, but also reduced the level of species over- and under-prediction. This study advances operational species mapping of diverse tropical landscapes by detailing the effect of imbalanced data on classification accuracy and providing estimates of tree species abundance in an agricultural landscape. Species maps using data and methods presented here can be used in landscape analyses of species distributions to understand human or environmental effects, in addition to focusing conservation efforts in areas with high tree cover and diversity.

TI  - Effect of deforestation on prevalence of avian haemosporidian parasites and mosquito abundance in a tropical rainforest of Cameroon
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY
AB  - Habitat change caused by deforestation can modify the interactions of many biotic and abiotic factors, and in turn influence patterns of diseases in wild birds. Whether deforestation directly or indirectly affects the prevalence of avian haemosporidian parasites through their hosts and/or vectors is still not well understood. We sampled understory bird communities (insectivorous, frugivorous, granivorous and nectarivorous birds) and mosquitoes in three habitats showing a gradient of deforestation (pristine forest, fragmented forest, and young palm oil plantation), to assess the effects of habitat changes on avian haemosporidian (Plasmodium and Haemoproteus) prevalence and its relationship to bird feeding guilds and mosquito abundance. Blood samples of 845 individual birds belonging to 85 species and 27 families were collected in the three habitat types and screened using microscopy and PCR. Plasmodium infections were detected in 136 individuals (16.09%) and varied significantly among habitat types while Haemoproteus infections were detected in 98 individuals (11.60%) and did not vary significantly among habitat types. However, the prevalence of Plasmodium and Haemoproteus in bird feeding groups varied significantly among habitats. Nectarivorous and granivorous birds had the highest Plasmodium and Haemoproteus prevalence, respectively. The abundance of mosquitoes varied significantly among habitat types and the prevalence of Plasmodium significantly and positively correlated with mosquito abundance in fragmented forest. This study highlights the importance of host and mosquito determinants in the transmission dynamics of avian Plasmodium and Haemoproteus infections following habitat changes. Selective logging favored an increase in the prevalence of Plasmodium in insectivores, the prevalence of Haemoproteus in nectarivores and the abundance of female mosquitoes while, the establishment of the palm oil plantation favored an increase in the prevalence of Plasmodium in granivores and Haemoproteus in nectarivores. Species feeding behavior is also an important determinant to consider for a better understanding of patterns of parasite infections in a changing environment.

TI  - Tropical forest restoration. twenty years of academic research
T2  - INTERCIENCIA
AB  - Ecological restoration is a young discipline that focuses upon the biotic and abiotic rehabilitation of natural systems in order to restore its structure and functional properties. The study of ecological restoration in tropical forests has concentrated on identifying the barriers that limit recovery, with the aim of accelerating secondary succession. These barriers include: 1) lack of dispersal or propagules in the seed bank, 2) low germination rates, and 3) low rates of seedling recruitment due to the negative effects of diseases, predation and competition, or adverse physical conditions. Based on the analysis of literature from the last 20 years on ecological restoration in tropical forests, this work reviews the state of the art and perspectives in this area of research. The analysis indicated that 64% of the studies have been conducted in tropical rain forests, that 55% of them are mainly descriptive, and that, the experimental studies tend to evaluate only one or two limiting barriers, rather than concentrating on a long term integrative approach. Nevertheless, there is a promising future for restoration ecology; the experimental approach has grown exponentially and the social component is being included in the projects. Ecological restoration is consolidating itself as an integrative discipline, keeping in mind all the necessary aspects (ecological, social, economic) to achieve the recovery and conservation of the natural systems.

TI  - Common themes in changing vector-borne disease scenarios
T2  - TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
CP  - Meeting of the Royal-Society-of-Tropical-Medicine-and-Hygiene
AB  - The impact of climate change on disease patterns is controversial. However, global burden of disease studies suggest that infectious diseases will contribute a proportionately smaller burden of disease over the next 2 decades as non-communicable diseases emerge as public health problems. However, infectious diseases contribute proportionately more in the poorest quintile of the population. Notwithstanding the different views of the impact of global warming on vector-borne infections this paper reviews the conditions which drive the changing epidemiology of these infections and suggests that such change is linked by common themes including interactions of generalist vectors and reservoir hosts at interfaces with humans, reduced biodiversity associated with anthropogenic environmental changes, increases in Plasmodium falciparum:P. vivax ratios and well-described land use changes such as hydrological, urbanization, agricultural, mining and forest-associated impacts (extractive activities, road building, deforestation and migration) which are seen on a global scale.

TI  - Assessing spatial distribution, stand impacts and rate of <i>Ceratocystis</i> <i>fimbriata</i> induced 'ohi'a (<i>Metrosideros polymorpha</i>) mortality in a tropical wet forest, Hawai'i Island, USA
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Pests or pathogens that affect trees have the potential to fundamentally alter forest composition, structure and function. Throughout the last six years, large areas of otherwise healthy 'ohi'a (Metrosideros polymorpha) trees have been dying rapidly (typically within weeks) in lowland tropical wet forest on Hawai'i Island, USA. This mortality is quite distinct from previous well-documented 'ohi'a dieback episodes driven by cohort senescence. Ceratocystis fimbiata was identified and routinely found associated with rapidly dying individuals of 'ohi'a, Hawai'i's most widespread native tree. Pathogenicity of this fungus was proven and M. polymorpha was recorded as a new host for C. fimbiata. Mortality of 'ohi'a at this scale is of great concern as the understory in these forests is often occupied by invasive non-native plants capable of severely limiting 'ohi'a regeneration. Imagery of 'ohi'a mortality obtained in 2012 revealed large expanses of greater than expected mortality (i.e., >= 10%) across 1600 ha. By 2014 'ohi'a mortality levels >= 10% had spread to 6403 ha, or 30% of total area classified as 'ohi'a in our study area. Further, levels of 'ohi'a mortality in field plots established within the study region averaged 39%, and mortality levels were comparable across size classes and forest compositions. Results from a subset of field plots re-inventoried one year after plot establishment revealed average annual 'ohi'a mortality rates of 24% and 28% based on basal area and stem density measures, respectively; mortality rates were as high as 47% in some field plots. The dearth of 'ohi'a seedling recruitment and characteristic understory dominance of non-native species documented within our research plots, coupled with the lethality of C. fimbriata to 'ohi'a, suggest that these forests likely will be dominated by non-native species in the future.

TI  - Assessing forest canopy closure in a geospatial medium to address management concerns for tropical islands-Southeast Asia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
AB  - The present study outlines an approach to classify forest density and to estimate canopy closure of the forest of the Andaman and Nicobar archipelago. The vector layers generated for the study area using satellite data was validated with the field knowledge of the surveyed ground control points. The methodology adopted in this present analysis is three-tiered. First, the density stratification into five zones using visual interpretation for the complete archipelago. In the second step, we identified two island groups from the Andaman to investigate and compare the forest strata density. The third and final step involved more of a localised phytosociological module that focused on the North Andaman Islands. The results based on the analysis of the high-resolution satellite data show that more than 75% of the mangroves are under high- to very high-density canopy class. The framework developed would serve as a significant measure to forest health and evaluate management concerns whilst addressing issues such as gap identification, conservation prioritisation and disaster management-principally to the post-tsunami assessment and analysis.

TI  - Research on the Spatiotemporal Evolution of Mangrove Forests in the Hainan Island from 1991 to 2021 Based on SVM and Res-UNet Algorithms
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Mangrove ecosystems play a dominant role in global, tropical, and subtropical coastal wetlands. Remote sensing plays a central role in mangrove conservation, as it is the preferred tool for monitoring changes in spatiotemporal distribution. To improve correlated estimation accuracies and explore the influencing mechanisms based on the mangrove ground survey, this study used a support vector machine (SVM) machine learning and Res-UNet deep learning algorithms to identify the land area of mangrove forests and the crown surface cover area of mangrove forests in the Hainan Island from 1991 to 2021. Both classification techniques were verified by a confusion matrix, which from 1991 to 2021, revealed overall accuracies of 93.11 +/- 1.54% and 96.43 +/- 1.15% for SVM and Res-UNet, respectively. Res-UNet was more accurate in identifying the crown surface cover area, whereas SVM was more suitable for obtaining the land area. Furthermore, based on the crown surface cover area of the mangrove forests on the Hainan Island, influencing mechanisms were analyzed through dynamic changes and landscape patterns. Since 1991, the Hainan Island mangrove forest area has increased, with the center of mass moving from coastal areas to the ocean and increasing the overall landscape fragmentation. Moreover, the change in the mangrove forests area was correlated with economic development and the increasingly urban population of the entire island. Altogether, the reliable assessment of the tropical mangrove forest land area and crown surface cover provides an important research foundation for the protection and restoration plans of tropical mangrove forests.

TI  - Distance metric-based forest cover change detection using MODIS time series
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
AB  - More than 12 years of global observations are now available from NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). As this time series grows, the MODIS archive provides new opportunities for identification and characterization of land cover at regional to global spatial scales and interannual to decadal temporal scales. In particular, the high temporal frequency of MODIS provides a rich basis for monitoring land cover dynamics. At the same time, the relatively coarse spatial resolution of MODIS (250-500 m) presents significant challenges for land cover change studies. In this paper, we present a distance metric-based change detection method for identifying changed pixels at annual time steps using 500 m MODIS time series data. The approach we describe uses distance metrics to measure (1) the similarity between a pixel's annual time series to annual time series for pixels of the same land cover class and (2) the similarity between annual time series from different years at the same pixel. Pre-processing, including gap-filling, smoothing and temporal subsetting of MODIS 500 m Nadir BRDF-adjusted Reflectance (NBAR) time series is essential to the success of our method. We evaluated our approach using three case studies. We first explored the ability of our method to detect change in temperate and boreal forest training sites in North America and Eurasia. We applied our method to map regional forest change in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States, and in tropical forests of the Xingu River Basin in Mato Grosso, Brazil. Results from these case studies show that the method successfully identified pixels affected by logging and fire disturbance in temperate and boreal forest sites. Change detection results in the Pacific Northwest compared well with a Landsat-based disturbance map, yielding a producer's accuracy of 85%. Assessment of change detection results for the Xingu River Basin demonstrated that detection accuracy improves as the fraction of deforestation within a MODIS pixel increases, but that relatively small changes in forest cover were still detectable from MODIS. Annually, over 80% of pixels with >20% deforested area were correctly identified and the timing of change showed good agreement with reference data. Errors of commission were largely associated with pixels located at the edges of disturbance events and inadequate characterization of land cover changes unrelated to deforestation in the reference data. Although our case studies focused on forests, this method is not specific to detection of forest cover change and has the potential to be applied to other types of land cover change including urban and agricultural expansion and intensification.

TI  - Tropical forests can maintain hyperdiversity because of enemies
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
AB  - Explaining the maintenance of tropical forest diversity under the countervailing forces of drift and competition poses a major challenge to ecological theory. Janzen-Connell effects, in which host-specific natural enemies restrict the recruitment of juveniles near conspecific adults, provide a potential mechanism. Janzen-Connell is strongly supported empirically, but existing theory does not address the stable coexistence of hundreds of species. Here we use high-performance computing and analytical models to demonstrate that tropical forest diversity can be maintained nearly indefinitely in a prolonged state of transient dynamics due to distance-responsive natural enemies. Further, we show that Janzen-Connell effects lead to community regulation of diversity by imposing a diversity-dependent cost to commonness and benefit to rarity. The resulting species-area and rank-abundance relationships are consistent with empirical results. Diversity maintenance over long time spans does not require dispersal from an external metacommunity, speciation, or resource niche partitioning, only a small zone around conspecific adults in which saplings fail to recruit. We conclude that the Janzen-Connell mechanism can explain the maintenance of tropical tree diversity while not precluding the operation of other niche-based mechanisms such as resource partitioning.

TI  - A landscape-based model for predicting <i>Mycobacterium ulcerans</i> infection (Buruli ulcer disease) presence in benin, West Africa
T2  - ECOHEALTH
AB  - Mycobacterium ulcerans infection (Buruli ulcer [BU] disease) is an emerging tropical disease that causes severe morbidity in many communities, especially those in close proximity to aquatic environments. Research and control efforts are severely hampered by the paucity of data regarding the ecology of this disease; for example, the vectors and modes of transmission remain unknown. It is hypothesized that BU presence is associated with altered landscapes that perturb aquatic ecosystems; however, this has yet to be quantified over large spatial scales. We quantified relationships between land use/land cover (LULC) characteristics surrounding individual villages and BU presence in Benin, West Africa. We also examined the effects of other village-level characteristics which we hypothesized to affect BU presence, such as village distance to the nearest river. We found that as the percent urban land use in a 50-km buffer surrounding a village increased, the probability of BU presence decreased. Conversely, as the percent agricultural land use in a 20-km buffer surrounding a village increased, the probability of BU presence increased. Landscape-based models had predictive ability when predicting BU presence using validation data sets from Benin and Ghana, West Africa. Our analyses suggest that relatively small amounts of urbanization are associated with a decrease in the probability of BU presence, and we hypothesize that this is due to the increased availability of pumped water in urban environments. Our models provide an initial approach to predicting the probability of BU presence over large spatial scales in Benin and Ghana, using readily available land use data.

TI  - Fragmentation impacts caused by roads through rainforests
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
AB  - Fragmentation is a severe threat to tropical rainforests. However the habitat loss and less extensive fragmentation caused by roads can also be a threat, not only through allowing access to remote areas, but also through a suite of insidious associated impacts. These include abiotic and biotic edge effects adjacent to road clearings, the disturbance impacts caused by vehicle operation, invasions by weeds, feral and alien fauna and disease, and faunal mortality from vehicle collisions. In combination, these can create a significant barrier to movements of rainforest biota. Impacts can be ameliorated through clever road design and sustainable vehicle operation.

TI  - Tropical amphibian populations experience higher disease risk in natural habitats
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
AB  - Habitat loss and disease are main drivers of global amphibian declines, yet the interaction between them remains largely unexplored. Here we show that paradoxically, habitat loss is negatively associated with occurrence, prevalence, and infection intensity of the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) in amphibian populations in the tropics. At a large spatial scale, increased habitat loss predicted lower disease risk in amphibian populations across Costa Rica and eastern Australia, even after jointly considering the effect of potential biotic and abiotic correlates. Lower host-species richness and suboptimal microclimates for Bd in disturbed habitats are potential mechanisms underlying this pattern. Furthermore, we found that anthropogenic deforestation practices biased to lowlands and natural vegetation remaining in inaccessible highlands explain increased Bd occurrence at higher elevations. At a smaller spatial scale, holding constant elevation, latitude, and macroclimate, we also found a negative relationship between habitat loss, and both Bd prevalence and infection intensity in frog populations in two landscapes of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Our results indicate that amphibians will be disproportionately affected by emerging diseases in pristine environments, and that, paradoxically, disturbed habitats may act as shelters from disease, but only for the very few species that can tolerate deforestation. Thus, tropical amphibian faunas are threatened both by destruction of natural habitats as well as increased disease in pristine forests. To curb further extinctions and develop effective mitigation and restoration programs we must look to interactions between habitat loss and disease, the two main factors at the root of global amphibian declines.

TI  - Spatial pattern assessment of tropical forest fire danger at Thuan Chau area (Vietnam) using GIS-based advanced machine learning algorithms: A comparative study
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
AB  - Thuan Chau is a serious district affected by forest fire in Vietnam, especially in 2016; however, no forest fire prediction research has been conducted for this region. Thus, knowledge of spatial patterns of fire danger of the district plays a key role in forest succession and ecological implications. This study's aim was to analyze the spatial pattern of fire danger for the tropical forest of Thuan Chau district using advanced machine learning algorithms, Support Vector Machine classifier (SVMC), Random Forests (RF), and Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network (MLP-Net). For this purpose, a GIS database for the study area was established with 564 forest fire locations and ten forest fire variables. Then, Pearson correlation method was used to assess the correlation of the variables with the forest fire. In the next step, three forest fire danger models, SVMC, RF, and MLP-Net, were trained and validated. Finally, global performance of these models was assessed using the classification accuracy (ACC), Kappa statistics (KS), Area under the curve (AUC). In addition, Wilcoxon signed-rank test was employed to check the prediction performance of these models. The result shows the three models performed well; however, the MLP-Net model has the highest prediction performance (ACC = 81.7, KS = 0.633, and AUC = 0.894), followed by the RF model (ACC = 81.1, KS = 0.621, and AUC = 0.883), and the SVMC model (ACC = 80.2, KS = 0.604, and AUC = 0.867). The result in this study is useful for the local authority and forest manager in forest management and fire suppression.

TI  - Major forests and plant species discrimination in Mudumalai forest region using airborne hyperspectral sensing
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIA-PACIFIC BIODIVERSITY
AB  - The present study focused on forest type classification and major plant species assemblages in Mudumalai forest region using Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer Next Generation. The phytosociological analysis exhibited a total of 657 individuals (1095 individuals ha(-1)) of 24 tree species belonging to 22 genera and 18 families. The highest tree density was contributed by Tectona grandis (132 individuals ha(-1) and 12.05% of total tree density) followed by Anogeissus latifolia (105 individuals ha(-1) and 9.59% of total tree density). The support vector machine study showed the dominance of Southern Tropical Semi-Evergreen forests (31%) followed by Southern Tropical moist deciduous forests (26.7%) and Southern Tropical dry deciduous forests (24.8%) with a very high accuracy (92.37%). The comparative analysis of the existing forest types with Champion and Seth's (1968) classification of forests exhibited a change of 30% in forest types in terms of their structure, composition, and extent over a period of 50 years. The spectral angle mapper-based study emphasized the defining role of elevation, rainfall, and temperature in species distribution, and physiognomy with dominance of A. latifolia (similar to 19.22%). The study implies the high spectral fidelity of airborne images for forest type mapping and plant species discrimination in tropical forests.

TI  - Neurological manifestations of Kyasanur Forest disease: a retrospective cohort study from South India
T2  - TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Background Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD) is a viral zoonotic disease where patients present with febrile illness and haemorrhagic manifestations in the first phase. In a small fraction of patients, the fever may be biphasic. This study aimed to describe the neurological manifestations of patients with KFD in the first and second phases of the illness. Methods This is a retrospective cohort study of 297 patients admitted with a molecular diagnosis of KFD from December 2018 to December 2020. The case records of these patients were reviewed for evidence of neurological involvement. Results A total of 34 (11.5%) patients in the first phase and 16 (36.4%) patients in the second phase had neurological involvement. Altered sensorium, seizures and focal infarcts were common in the first phase, while cerebellar signs and leptomeningeal enhancement were common in the second phase. Conclusions Neurological involvement is seen in both phases of KFD. While in the first phase it is a result of possible encephalitis/encephalopathy, the second phase involvement is possibly due to postinfectious cerebellitis or meningitis.

TI  - Emerging infectious diseases in a globalized world
T2  - MEDICINA BALEAR
AB  - The impact that zoonoses have today worldwide on human populations is an unprecedented phenomenon. Three quarters of emerging infectious diseases that affect people have its origin in animals. This paper analyzes the conditions are necessary for an epidemic to occur: the species leap, the amplification, and the propagation.
   Currently, the natural systems are changing at an unprecedented rate and can modify the interactions between humans and reservoirs and vectors of viruses. Most of these changes have an anthropic origin and can increase the probability of species leap. One of the most important environmental changes taking place is the deforestation in tropical regions, whether to create space for new human settlements, land for pasture, crops or farming, or for commercial logging.
   The demographic increase plays an important role from an epidemiological point of view because does that the urban areas grow in inhabitant numbers and facilitates the amplification of the infection. For this reason, cities are exposed to epidemics and we must prepare them and protect them against future epidemics.
   Current mobility is unprecedented in human history and represent a critical epidemiological factor that increases the risk of disease propagations.
   Much of the emergence, amplification and propagation of the zoonosis are consequence of human actMty. In this sense, ono of the things we must learn as quickly as possible is that we need to change our relationship with the natural systems, Lecau-ie actions can have consequences - such as pandemics.

TI  - Analysis of wind damage caused by multiple tropical storm events in Japanese <i>Cryptomeria japonica</i> forests
T2  - FORESTRY
AB  - This study analyzed wind damage caused by tropical storms from 1991 to 2007 to Japanese forests mainly consisting of Cryptomeria japonica. Statistical analyses based on logistic regression and Cox regression models were conducted in relation to conditions at the forest and stand level. Known damage to forests managed by Kyusyu Rinsan Corporation (KR forests), located on the Kyushu Island, was analyzed at the forest level, using tropical storm characteristics such as air pressure, precipitation and periods when the forests were within the storm zone as predictors. Wind damage was also examined at the stand level (150 analysis points) using Cox regression models, according to stand age, site index, terrain conditions, management practices and wind velocity indicators (horizontal and vertical velocity vectors). The results indicated that at the forest level, higher maximum hourly wind speed and longer periods of 15 m s(1) of wind speed were significantly correlated to damage occurrence. At the stand level, indicators of upward vertical velocity, thinning treatments and site index were positively associated with the probability of wind damage. For instance, stands receiving higher upward vertical velocities and thinning treatment within 2 years were more likely to have reduced stability against tropical storms. Stands with higher and lower site index than average also showed lower stability in our analysis.

TI  - Distribution of pathogenic <i>Leptospira</i> in environmental water and soils of selected recreational forests in Perak, Malaysia
T2  - TROPICAL BIOMEDICINE
AB  - Leptospirosis is an emerging zoonotic disease endemic in tropical regions. Aiming at assessing the potential infection risks via recreational exposure, the molecular prevalence of pathogenic Leptospira in 14 amenity forests in five selected districts of the state of Perak was determined. Water and soil samples along streams and waterfalls were subjected to culture of leptospires and the pathogenic Leptospira spp. was detected by lipL32-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Twenty out of 154 samples (13%) that tested positive for leptospires were mostly soils and still water recorded with tolerable temperatures (22.2-26.5 degrees C) and pHs (5.73-6.70). The localised prevalence was highly varied among eight positive forests (6.7-41.7%), particularly higher in Kampar and Kinta districts which are the more populated urban areas. The importance of public health surveillance should not be underrated given the high prevalence of Leptospira spp. in forests in close proximity to indigenous settlements, even where the places are clean. Overall, this study discovered a wide distribution of pathogenic Leptospira spp. in recreational areas.

TI  - Exploring the influence of deforestation on dengue fever incidence in the Brazilian Amazonas state
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Introduction
   Dengue fever is the most prevalent arboviral disease in the Brazilian Amazon and places a major health, social and economic burden on the region. Its association with deforestation is largely unknown, yet the clearing of tropical rainforests has been linked to the emergence of several infectious diseases, including yellow fever and malaria. This study aimed to explore potential drivers of dengue emergence in the Brazilian Amazon with a focus on deforestation.
   Methods
   An ecological study design using municipality-level secondary data from the Amazonas state between 2007 and 2017 (reported rural dengue cases, incremental deforestation, socioeconomic characteristics, healthcare and climate factors) was employed. Data were transformed according to the year with the most considerable deforestation. Associations were explored using bivariate analysis and a multivariate generalised linear model.
   Results
   During the study period 2007-2017, both dengue incidence and deforestation increased. Bivariate analysis revealed increased incidences for some years after deforestation (e.g. mean difference between dengue incidence before and three years after deforestation was 55.47 cases per 100,000, p = 0.002), however, there was no association between the extent of deforestation and dengue incidence. Using a negative binomial regression model adjusted for socioeconomic, climate and healthcare factors, deforestation was not found to be related to dengue incidence. Access to healthcare was found to be the only significant predictor of dengue incidence.
   Discussion
   Previous research has shown that deforestation facilitates the emergence of vector-borne diseases. However, no significant dose-response relationships between dengue incidence and deforestation in the Brazilian Amazonas state were found in this study. The finding that access to healthcare was the only significant predictor of dengue incidence suggests that incidence may be more dependent on surveillance than transmission. Further research and public attention are needed to better understand environmental effects on human health and to preserve the world's largest rainforest.

TI  - Deforestation for oil palm increases microclimate suitability for the development of the disease vector <i>Aedes albopictus</i>
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - A major trade-off of land-use change is the potential for increased risk of infectious diseases, a.o. through impacting disease vector life-cycles. Evaluating the public health implications of land-use conversions requires spatially detailed modelling linking land-use to vector ecology. Here, we estimate the impact of deforestation for oil palm cultivation on the number of life-cycle completions of Aedes albopictus via its impact on local microclimates. We apply a recently developed mechanistic phenology model to a fine-scaled (50-m resolution) microclimate dataset that includes daily temperature, rainfall and evaporation. Results of this combined model indicate that the conversion from lowland rainforest to plantations increases suitability for A. albopictus development by 10.8%, moderated to 4.7% with oil palm growth to maturity. Deforestation followed by typical plantation planting-maturation-clearance-replanting cycles is predicted to create pulses of high development suitability. Our results highlight the need to explore sustainable land-use scenarios that resolve conflicts between agricultural and human health objectives.

TI  - Floral traits and pollination systems in the Caatinga, a Brazilian tropical dry forest
T2  - ANNALS OF BOTANY
AB  - Background and aims Pollination is a critical stage in plant reproduction and thus in the maintenance and evolution of species and communities. The Caatinga is the fourth largest ecosystem in Brazil, but despite its great extent and its importance few studies providing ecological information are available, with a notable lack of work focusing on pollination biology. Here, general data are presented regarding the frequency of pollination systems within Caatinga communities, with the aim of characterizing patterns related to floral attributes in order to make possible comparisons with data for plant communities in other tropical areas, and to test ideas about the utility of syndromes. This paper also intends to provide a reference point for further studies on pollination ecology in this threatened ecosystem.
   Methods The floral traits and the pollination systems of 147 species were analysed in three areas of Caatinga vegetation in northeastern Brazil, and compared with world-wide studies focusing on the same subject. For each species, floral attributes were recorded as form, size, colour, rewards and pollination units. The species were grouped into 12 guilds according to the main pollinator vector. Analyses of the frequencies of the floral traits and pollination systems were undertaken.
   Key Results Nectar and pollen were the most common floral resources and insect pollination was the most frequent, occurring in 69.9% of the studied species. Of the entomophilous species, 61.7% were considered to be melittophilous (43.1% of the total). Vertebrate pollination occurred in 28.1% of the species (ornithophily in 15.0% and chiropterophily in 13.1%), and anemophily was recorded in only 2.0%.
   Conclusions The results indicated that the pollination systems in Caatinga, despite climatic restrictions, are diversified, with a low percentage of generalist flowers, and similar to other tropical dry and wet forest communities, including those with high rainfall levels.

TI  - Mapping tree species in tropical seasonal semi-deciduous forests with hyperspectral and multispectral data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Accurately mapping the spatial distribution of tree species in tropical environments provides valuable insights for ecologists and forest managers. This process may play an important role in reducing fieldwork costs, monitoring changes in canopy biodiversity, and locating parent trees to collect seeds for forest restoration efforts. However, mapping tree species in tropical forests with remote sensing data is a challenge because of high floristic and spectral diversity. In this research, we discriminated and mapped tree species in tropical seasonal semi-deciduous forests (Brazilian Atlantic Forest Biome) by using airborne hyperspectral and simulated multispectral data in the 450 to 2400 nm wavelength range. After quantifying the spectral variability within and among individual tree crowns of eight species, three supervised machine learning classifiers were applied to discriminate the species at the pixel level. Linear Discriminant Analysis outperformed Support Vector Machines with Linear and Radial Basis Function (RBF-SVMs) kernels and Random Forests in almost all the tested cases. An average classification accuracy of 70% was obtained when using the visible/near-infrared (VNIR, 450-919 nm) bands. The inclusion of shortwave infrared bands (SWIR, 1045-2400 nm) increased the accuracy to 84%. Narrow-band vegetation indices (VIs) were also tested and increased the classification accuracy by up to 5% when combined with VNIR features. Furthermore, the spectral bands of the WorldView-3 (WV-3) satellite sensor were simulated for classification purposes. WV-3 VNIR bands provided an accuracy of 57.4%, which increased to 74.8% when using WV-3 SWIR bands. We also tested the production of species maps by using an object-oriented approach that integrated a novel segmentation algorithm that was tailored to delineate tree crowns and label high class membership pixels inside each object. In this scenario, RBF-SVMs produced the best species maps, correctly identifying 84.9% of crowns with hyperspectral data and 78.5% with simulated WV-3 data. The use of a reduced set of hyperspectral bands, which were selected with stepwise regression, did not significantly affect the classification accuracies but allowed us to depict the most important wavelengths to discriminate the species. These wavelengths were located around the green reflectance peak (550 nm), at the red absorption feature (650 nm) and in the SWIR range at 1200,1700, 2100 and 2300 nm. These encouraging results suggest the feasibility of the proposed approach for mapping pioneering and climax tree species in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest Biome, highlighting its potential use in forest recovery and inventory initiatives.

TI  - Calibration of spaceborne scatterometers using tropical rain forests
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Wind scatterometers are radar systems designed specifically to measure the normalized radar backscatter coefficient (sigma degrees) of the ocean's surface in order to determine the near-surface wind vector. Postlaunch calibration of a wind scatterometer can be performed with an extended-area natural target such as the Amazon tropical rain forest. Rain forests exhibit a remarkably high degree of homogeneity in their radar response over a very large area though some spatial and temporal variability exist. In this paper we present a simple technique for calibrating scatterometer data using tropical rain forests. Using a polynomial model for the rolloff of sigma degrees with incidence angle, the technique determines gain corrections to ensure consistency between different antennas and processing channels. Corrections for the time varying instrument gain are made consistent with a seasonally fixed rain forest response; however, without ground stations or aircraft flights, it is difficult to uniquely distinguish between seasonal variations in the rain forest and slow variations of the system gain. Applying the corrections, the intrinsic variability of the sigma degrees of the rain forest is estimated to be +/-0.15 dB, which is the limit of the accuracy of calibration using the rain forest. The technique is illustrated with Seasat scatterometer (SASS) data and applied to ERS-1 Active Microwave Instrument scatterometer (Escat) data. Gain corrections of up to several tenths of a decibel are estimated for SASS. Corrections for Escat data are found to be very small, suggesting that Escat data is well calibrated.

TI  - Do pathogens limit the distributions of tropical trees across a rainfall gradient?
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
AB  - 1. Organisms are adapted to particular habitats; consequently, community composition changes across environmental gradients, enhancing regional diversity. In Panama, a rainfall gradient correlates with the spatial turnover of tree species. While strong evidence suggests that tree species common in the wetter forests are excluded from the drier forests by seasonal drought, the factor(s) excluding drought-tolerant species, common in the drier forests, from the wetter forests remain ambiguous.
   2. Here, we show that seedlings were significantly more likely to suffer pathogen-caused damage and mortality in the wetter forest. While seedlings of dry-and wet-forest species were equally likely to suffer pathogen attack, seedlings of dry-forest species were significantly more likely to die when attacked and tended to suffer more pathogen-caused mortality overall. Furthermore, seedlings of dry-forest species suffered pathogen-caused mortality in the forest in which they do not naturally occur and in which conspecific and/or congeneric adults are absent or rare, indicating that some pathogens are relatively widespread and/or are capable of damaging multiple host species.
   3. Synthesis. Elevated risk of pathogen-caused damage and mortality in the wetter forests and a greater impact to host fitness from pathogen attack for seedlings of dry-forest species suggest that pathogens may enhance regional forest diversity by contributing to changes in tree species composition via the exclusion of dry-forest tree species from the wetter forests. This study highlights a potentially widespread and under explored mechanism by which pathogens shape plant communities at the landscape scale. An understanding of how species' distributions are shaped by the interplay between abiotic and biotic factors is essential for conservation biology.

TI  - Incorporating Canopy Cover for Airborne-Derived Assessments of Forest Biomass in the Tropical Forests of Cambodia
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - This research examines the role of canopy cover in influencing above ground biomass (AGB) dynamics of an open canopied forest and evaluates the efficacy of individual-based and plot-scale height metrics in predicting AGB variation in the tropical forests of Angkor Thom, Cambodia. The AGB was modeled by including canopy cover from aerial imagery alongside with the two different canopy vertical height metrics derived from LiDAR; the plot average of maximum tree height (Max_CH) of individual trees, and the top of the canopy height (TCH). Two different statistical approaches, log-log ordinary least squares (OLS) and support vector regression (SVR), were used to model AGB variation in the study area. Ten different AGB models were developed using different combinations of airborne predictor variables. It was discovered that the inclusion of canopy cover estimates considerably improved the performance of AGB models for our study area. The most robust model was log-log OLS model comprising of canopy cover only (r = 0.87; RMSE = 42.8 Mg/ha). Other models that approximated field AGB closely included both Max_CH and canopy cover (r = 0.86, RMSE = 44.2 Mg/ha for SVR; and, r = 0.84, RMSE = 47.7 Mg/ha for log-log OLS). Hence, canopy cover should be included when modeling the AGB of open-canopied tropical forests.

TI  - Human density modulates spatial associations among tropical forest terrestrial mammal species
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - The spatial aggregation of species pairs often increases with the ecological similarity of the species involved. However, the way in which environmental conditions and anthropogenic activity affect the relationship between spatial aggregation and ecological similarity remains unknown despite the potential for spatial associations to affect species interactions, ecosystem function, and extinction risk. Given that human disturbance has been shown to both increase and decrease spatial associations among species pairs, ecological similarity may have a role in mediating these patterns. Here, we test the influences of habitat diversity, primary productivity, human population density, and species' ecological similarity based on functional traits (i.e., functional trait similarity) on spatial associations among tropical forest mammals. Large mammals are highly sensitive to anthropogenic change and therefore susceptible to changes in interspecific spatial associations. Using two-species occupancy models and camera trap data, we quantified the spatial overlap of 1216 species pairs from 13 tropical forest protected areas around the world. We found that the association between ecological similarity and interspecific species associations depended on surrounding human density. Specifically, aggregation of ecologically similar species was more than an order of magnitude stronger in landscapes with the highest human density compared to those with the lowest human density, even though all populations occurred within protected areas. Human-induced changes in interspecific spatial associations have been shown to alter top-down control by predators, increase disease transmission and increase local extinction rates. Our results indicate that anthropogenic effects on the distribution of wildlife within protected areas are already occurring and that impacts on species interactions, ecosystem functions, and extinction risk warrant further investigation.

TI  - High risk for chikungunya virus to initiate an enzootic sylvatic cycle in the tropical Americas
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) has dispersed in the Americas since 2013, and its range of distribution has overlapped large forested areas. Herein, we assess vector competence of two sylvatic Neotropical mosquito species, Haemagogus leucocelaenus and Aedes terrens, to evaluate the risk of CHIKV to initiate a sylvatic cycle in the continent.
   Methodology/Principal findings
   Haemagogus leucocelaenus and Ae. terrens from the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil were orally challenged with the two CHIKV lineages circulating in the Americas. Fully engorged females were kept in incubators at 28 +/- 1 degrees C and 70 +/- 10% humidity and examined at 3 and 7 days after virus exposure. Body (thorax plus abdomen), head and saliva samples were analyzed for respectively determining infection, dissemination and transmission. Both Hg. leucocelaenus and Ae. terrens exhibited high infection and dissemination rates with both CHIKV isolates at 7 dpi, demonstrating that they are susceptible to CHIKV, regardless of the lineage. Remarkably, Hg. leucocelaenus expectorated infectious viral particles as rapidly as 3 days after the infectious blood meal, displaying higher values of transmission rate and efficiency than Ae. terrens. Nevertheless, both species were competent to experimentally transmit both CHIKV genotypes, exhibiting vector competence similar to several American Aedes aegypti.
   Conclusions/Significance
   These results point out the high risk for CHIKV to establish a sylvatic transmission cycle in the Americas, which could be a serious health issue as CHIKV would become another zoonotic infection difficult to control in the continent.

TI  - Oil, macroeconomics, and forests: Assessing the linkages
T2  - WORLD BANK RESEARCH OBSERVER
AB  - How does an oil boom affect the forest cover of tropical oil-exporting countries? What macroeconomic linkages and policies are decisive? A comparison of research findings on long-run land-use changes in eight tropical developing economies reveals that the direct physical impacts of the oil industry on forests are unquestionably less than its derived macroeconomic impact. In most cases oil wealth indirectly but significantly protects tropical forests. The core mechanism is that oil rents cause macroeconomic "Dutch disease" decreasing the price competitiveness of agriculture and logging, strongly diminishing pressures for forest degradation and deforestation. But domestic policy responses to oil wealth are also vital determinants of the forest outcome. When governments use oil wealth for urban spending sprees, this reinforces the core effect by pulling more labor out of land-using and forest-degrading activities. When oil revenues finance road construction or frontier colonization, however, the core forest-protective effect can be reversed, Repeated currency devaluation and import protection of land-using domestic sectors also increase pressures on forests. Other international capital transfers, like bilateral credits, aid, or debt relief, can have impacts similar to those of oil wealth, either alleviating pressures on forests or aggravating specific forest-detrimental policies. These insights point to forest-friendly safeguards that can realistically be made in the design of structural adjustment programs, considering the important tradeoffs between development and conservation objectives.

TI  - A hyperspectral image can predict tropical tree growth rates in single-species stands
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
AB  - Remote sensing is increasingly needed to meet the critical demand for estimates of forest structure and composition at landscape to continental scales. Hyperspectral images can detect tree canopy properties, including species identity, leaf chemistry and disease. Tree growth rates are related to these measurable canopy properties but whether growth can be directly predicted from hyperspectral data remains unknown. We used a single hyperspectral image and light detection and ranging-derived elevation to predict growth rates for 20 tropical tree species planted in experimental plots. We asked whether a consistent relationship between spectral data and growth rates exists across all species and which spectral regions, associated with different canopy chemical and structural properties, are important for predicting growth rates. We found that a linear combination of narrowband indices and elevation is correlated with standardized growth rates across all 20 tree species (R-2 = 53.70%). Although wavelengths from the entire visible-to-shortwave infrared spectrum were involved in our analysis, results point to relatively greater importance of visible and near-infrared regions for relating canopy reflectance to tree growth data. Overall, we demonstrate the potential for hyperspectral data to quantify tree demography over a much larger area than possible with field-based methods in forest inventory plots.

TI  - Global Factors Driving Emerging Infectious Diseases Impact on Wildlife Populations
T2  - Animal Biodiversity and Emerging Diseases: Prediction and Prevention
CP  - 9th Biennial Conference on Animal Biodiversity and Emerging Diseases - Prediction and Prevention
AB  - The extinction of species across the globe is accelerating directly or indirectly from human activities. Biological impoverishment, habitat fragmentation, climate change, increasing toxification, and the rapid global movement of people and other living organisms have worked synergistically to diminish ecosystem function. This has resulted in unprecedented levels of disease emergence driven by human-induced environmental degradation, which poses a threat to the survival and health of biodiversity. What is often overlooked in the discussion of the health consequences to humans is that critically endangered wildlife species are at grave risk of extinction by disease outbreaks. As habitat becomes more compressed and with migration routes cut off, gene pools of small species are stranded in isolated habitat fragments. Species now are vulnerable to encroachment, malnutrition, environmental pollutants, and epidemics from domestic animals and humans. Furthermore, the continuous degradation of ecosystems is leading to increased stress, immunosuppression, and greater susceptibility to disease. Disease can be catastrophic to a diminished stressed population, becoming in some instances the leading factor of local, regional, and global extinctions. The strategies of the new field of conservation medicine include long-term monitoring, health assessment, and interventions to protect species at risk. We particularly must minimize the threat of any potentially catastrophic disease outbreaks resulting from anthropogenic changes to the environment. Current and future diagnostic molecular techniques offer new opportunities to identify tools for the management and possible treatment of diseases in imperiled species.

TI  - Yeasts vectored by Drosophila quadrum (Calloptera group) in tropical rain forests
T2  - REVISTA DE MICROBIOLOGIA
AB  - Yeast-Drosophila interactions in Tropical Rain Forests of Brazil are specialized when compared to temperate ecosystems, and tropical species of Drosophila have preferences that vary in the degree of choice of yeasts. Yeasts associated with Drosophila of the forest-inhabiting tripunctata, willistoni and guarani groups are probably of fruit origin. They differ from yeasts isolated fi om the fasciola subgroup flies of the repleta group, which seem to colonize epiphytic cacti in the forest canopy. The yeasts vectored by Drosophila quadrum (calloptera group) were surveyed and compared with the communities associated with the flies of tripunctata, willistoni, guarani and the cosmopolitan melanogaster group in forest sites of Rio de Janeiro. The yeasts vectored by D. quadrum included Candida guilliermondii, Debaryomyces melissophilus, Debaryomyces vanriji, Kloeckera apis, Pichia membranaefaciens and Rhodotorula rubra as most frequent species. These yeasts are usually associated with flowers and deteriorating fruits in the forest, indicating that D. quadrum feeds preferably on flowers and fruits in advanced states of decomposition. The yeasts associated with the calloptera group were similar to yeasts isolated from the tripunctata and guarani flies that probably occupy similar niches on the forest floor and vicinities. The calloptera flies had a lower niche overlap with flies from the fasciola subgroup, and from the willistoni and melanogaster groups in the sane forest.

AB  - ESA Forest Carbon Monitoring project (FCM) is developing Earth Observation based, user-centric approaches for forest carbon monitoring. Forest carbon accounting based on forest inventory requires precise and timely estimation of forest variables at various spatial levels accompanied by verifiable uncertainty information. In this paper, we present the algorithm trade-off and selection approach and preliminary results of the algorithm intercomparison exercise in the FCM project. The studies were performed over 7 European test sites located in Finland, Ireland, Romania, Spain and Switzerland, and one tropical forest site in Peru. EO datasets were represented by Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, TanDEM-X and ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 imagery. Examined approaches include popular parametric and SAR/InSAR scattering physics based approaches, and nonparametric and machine learning approaches such as k-NN, random forests, support vector regression.

Multiple polarimetric variables are required as an input to ensure consistent height retrieval performance across a broad range of forest heights. We train the SVM with LiDAR samples and different polarimetric variables based on 5000 samples (less than 1% of the full subset) collected across the images using a stratified random sampling approach. The trained SVM was applied to the rest of the image using the same variables but excluding the LiDAR samples. The estimated height was cross validated versus LiDAR-derived height (RH100) yielding overall good accuracy with r(2)=0.86 and RMSE = 6.8 m.

TI  - Use and perceived importance of forest ecosystem services in rural livelihoods of Chittagong Hill Tracts, Bangladesh
T2  - ECOSYSTEM SERVICES
AB  - This study examines the relative benefits (provisioning) and importance (regulating and cultural) of forest ecosystem services to households in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) region of Bangladesh. Our results from 300 household interviews in three rural locations stratified by wealth shows that wealth levels of the respondents play a key role in explaining variations in the perceptions and use of forest ecosystem services. Considering the direct benefits, the importance of provisioning ecosystem services (i.e. fuel wood, food, timber, bamboo, thatch grass and fodder) varies according to their relative use (i.e. subsistence and cash income) among households of different wealth groups. No significant difference was found in perceptions of indirect benefits of forest ecosystem services of water purification, regulating air quality, crop pollination, soil fertility, aesthetic and spiritual services. But the higher wealth groups perceived soil protection, soil fertility, pest and disease control as important for crop production as they have large landholdings for agricultural uses and tree cover. This study suggests local wealth conditions of the rural households characterise the demand of the use and perceived importance of forest ecosystem services. Differences in levels of wealth and ecosystem service provision imply careful consideration of social and economic factors in decision-making and making appropriate interventions for forest and tree management. The ecosystem services approach appears to be useful in capturing the broader diversity of benefits of forests and trees (i.e. material and non-material) as well as in supporting their integrated management at the landscape scale.

TI  - Unmanned Aerial System and Machine Learning Techniques Help to Detect Dead Woody Components in a Tropical Dry Forest
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Background and Objectives:Increased frequency and intensity of drought events are predicted to occur throughout the world because of climate change. These extreme climate events result in higher tree mortality and fraction of dead woody components, phenomena that are currently being reported worldwide as critical indicators of the impacts of climate change on forest diversity and function. In this paper, we assess the accuracy and processing times of ten machine learning (ML) techniques, applied to multispectral unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) data to detect dead canopy woody components.Materials and Methods:This work was conducted on five secondary dry forest plots located at the Santa Rosa National Park Environmental Monitoring Super Site, Costa Rica.Results:The coverage of dead woody components at the selected secondary dry forest plots was estimated to range from 4.8% to 16.1%, with no differences between the successional stages. Of the ten ML techniques, the support vector machine with radial kernel (SVMR) and random forests (RF) provided the highest accuracies (0.982 vs. 0.98, respectively). Of these two ML algorithms, the processing time of SVMR was longer than the processing time of RF (8735.64 s vs. 989 s).Conclusions:Our results demonstrate that it is feasible to detect and quantify dead woody components, such as dead stands and fallen trees, using a combination of high-resolution UAV data and ML algorithms. Using this technology, accuracy values higher than 95% were achieved. However, it is important to account for a series of factors, such as the optimization of the tuning parameters of the ML algorithms, the environmental conditions and the time of the UAV data acquisition.

TI  - Zoonotic risk factors associated with seroprevalence of Ebola virus GP antibodies in the absence of diagnosed Ebola virus disease in the Democratic Republic of Congo
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Author summary Ebola virus (EBOV) is spread through exposure to infected bodily fluids of a human or animal. While EBOV can lead to a severe disease, Ebola Virus Disease (EVD), it is possible for individuals to have anti-EBOV antibodies without ever getting sick with EVD. Seroreactivity (the detection of antigen-specific antibodies) suggests that that person has been exposed to EBOV or a similar virus in the past. Our study looked for seroreactive individuals who have never received an EVD diagnosis in four sites across the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Then we checked if animal exposures previously linked to EVD were more common among seroreactive individuals than non-seroreactive individuals. Among respondents from all four sites, 113 (8.3%) were seroreactive to EBOV. Additionally, contact with bats, rodents, and eating non-human primate meat were associated with seroreactivity, indicating these factors may be predictors of undocumented EBOV exposure events. These findings show that some EVD risk factors may be associated with EBOV seroreactivity without EVD diagnosis. Future research is needed to clarify the relationships between zoonotic exposures, seroreactivity, asymptomatic infection, and EVD.
   Background Ebola virus (EBOV) is a zoonotic filovirus spread through exposure to infected bodily fluids of a human or animal. Though EBOV is capable of causing severe disease, referred to as Ebola Virus Disease (EVD), individuals who have never been diagnosed with confirmed, probable or suspected EVD can have detectable EBOV antigen-specific antibodies in their blood. This study aims to identify risk factors associated with detectable antibody levels in the absence of an EVD diagnosis. Methodology Data was collected from September 2015 to August 2017 from 1,366 consenting individuals across four study sites in the DRC (Boende, Kabondo-Dianda, Kikwit, and Yambuku). Seroreactivity was determined to EBOV GP IgG using Zaire Ebola Virus Glycoprotein (EBOV GP antigen) ELISA kits (Alpha Diagnostic International, Inc.) in Kinshasa, DRC; any result above 4.7 units/mL was considered seroreactive. Among the respondents, 113 (8.3%) were considered seroreactive. Several zoonotic exposures were associated with EBOV seroreactivity after controlling for age, sex, healthcare worker status, location, and history of contact with an EVD case, namely: ever having contact with bats, ever having contact with rodents, and ever eating non-human primate meat. Contact with monkeys or non-human primates was not associated with seroreactivity. Conclusions This analysis suggests that some zoonotic exposures that have been linked to EVD outbreaks can also be associated with EBOV GP seroreactivity in the absence of diagnosed EVD. Future investigations should seek to clarify the relationships between zoonotic exposures, seroreactivity, asymptomatic infection, and EVD.

TI  - Diversity of mosquito (Diptera: Culicidae) vectors in a heterogeneous landscape endemic for arboviruses
T2  - ACTA TROPICA
AB  - Background: In Brazil and several countries in the Americas, where dengue, chikungunya and Zika are co circulating, there is a need to understand how different mosquito species relate to landscape and humans. Mosquito ecology and distribution, especially at finer spatial scales, are key factors to study since the relationship of mosquito communities to their habitats might have important consequences in the risk of disease transmission to humans. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diversity of resident culicids along heterogeneous landscapes in different endemic cities for dengue, chikungunya and Zika.
   Methods: Fourteen collection sites were randomly selected in six landscapes characterized as urban, periurban and rural along two endemic metropolitan cities in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil: Itaborai and Cachoeiras de Macacu, Rio de Janeiro. In each site, adult mosquito collections were performed using different traps and backpack aspiration. Collections took place during the rainy and dry seasons of 2015 and 2016. To measure diversity in each landscape, we generated species accumulation curves and used different indexes: rarefied species richness, Chao1-bc and ACE-1. Mosquito habitat segregation along different land use types was measured with a partial canonical correspondence analysis (pCCA). Generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) were used to model the probability of occurrence of the most abundant species along an Urban-Forest gradient.
   Results: A total of 13,462 adult mosquitoes from 10 genera and 41 species were collected. The most abundant species were Culex quinquefasciatus Say, 1823, Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus, 1762) and Aedes albopictus (Skuse, 1895). There was a significant association between rarefied species richness and landscape, with higher richness in the Rural landscape. The number of observed species was matched only in the Urban landscape. Most species showed segregation along an Urban-Forest gradient, and the great majority were associated with forested habitats. We were able to fit prediction models for six mosquito species.
   Discussion: The paper discusses the impact of human activities on landscape and its effects on mosquito populations, focusing on the segregation of different known vector species and their proximity to human altered environments. Most of these species are known arbovirus vectors and knowledge of their distribution are key elements that health authorities should take into account when planning arbovirus surveillance and vector control activities.

TI  - Hyperspectral discrimination of tropical dry forest lianas and trees: Comparative data reduction approaches at the leaf and canopy levels
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
AB  - A dataset of spectral signatures (leaf level) of tropical dry forest trees and lianas and an airborne hyperspectral image (crown level) are used to test three hyperspectral data reduction techniques (principal component analysis, forward feature selection and wavelet energy feature vectors) along with pattern recognition classifiers to discriminate between the spectral signatures of lianas and trees. It was found at the leaf level the forward waveband selection method had the best results followed by the wavelet energy feature vector and a form of principal component analysis. For the same dataset our results indicate that none of the pattern recognition classifiers performed the best across all reduction techniques, and also that none of the parametric classifiers had the overall lowest training and testing errors. At the crown level, in addition to higher testing error rates (7%), it was found that there was no optimal data reduction technique. The significant wavebands were also found to be different between the leaf and crown levels. At the leaf level, the visible region of the spectrum was the most important for discriminating between lianas and trees whereas at the crown level the shortwave infrared was also important in addition to the visible and near infrared.

TI  - Are tropical fungal endophytes hyperdiverse?
T2  - ECOLOGY LETTERS
AB  - Fungal endophytes are ubiquitous fungi that inhabit healthy plant tissues without causing disease. Endophytes have been found in every plant species examined to date and may be important, but often overlooked, components of fungal biodiversity. In two sites in a lowland, moist tropical forest of central Panama, we quantified endophyte colonization patterns, richness, host preference, and spatial variation in healthy leaves of two co-occurring, understory tree species [Heisteria concinna (Olacaceae) and Ouratea lucens (Ochnaceae)]. From 83 leaves, all of which were colonized by endophytes, we isolated 418 endophyte morphospecies (estimated 347 genetically distinct taxa), most of which were represented by only a single isolate (59%). Among morphospecies encountered in more than one leaf (nonsingletons), we found evidence of host preference and spatial heterogeneity using both morphospecies frequencies and presence/absence records. Based on these data, we postulate that tropical endophytes themselves may be hyperdiverse and suggest that extrapolative estimates that exclude them will markedly underestimate fungal species diversity.

TI  - Susceptibility of Tree Seedlings to Biotic and Abiotic Hazards in the Understory of a Moist Tropical Forest in Panama
T2  - BIOTROPICA
AB  - We evaluated temporal patterns of seedling survival of eight Neotropical tree species generated under multiple abiotic and biotic hazards (vertebrates, disease, litterfall) in the forest understory on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. Seedlings were transplanted at first leaf expansion in low densities along a 6-km transect and damage and mortality were recorded for 1 yr. We also planted and monitored small and large artificial seedlings to estimate physical disturbance regimes. During 0-2 mo after transplant, vertebrate consumers of reserve cotyledons caused high mortality of real seedlings, but little damage to artificial seedlings. On real seedlings after 2 mo, disease became an important agent of mortality, despite a decrease in overall mortality rates. Damage by litterfall remained relatively low during the 1-yr study period. Survival ranks among species showed ontogenetic shifts over time, as species changed susceptibility to the mortality agents. Survival after 2 mo was positively correlated with stem toughness, not because species with tough stems were less likely to receive mechanical damage, but because they survived better after receiving mechanical damage. Within each transplant station, artificial seedlings were not good predictors of litterfall damage experienced by real seedlings. Forest-wide litterfall damage level, however, was similar for both real and artificial seedlings (ca 10%/yr), a moderate level compared to other tropical forests. In conclusion, species traits including biomechanical traits interact to create complex temporal patterns of first year seedling survival, resulting in ontogenetic shifts that largely reflect changes in the relative importance of vertebrate consumers relative to other hazards.

TI  - Mapping Above-Ground Biomass in a Tropical Forest in Cambodia Using Canopy Textures Derived from Google Earth
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - This study develops a modelling framework for utilizing very high-resolution (VHR) aerial imagery for monitoring stocks of above-ground biomass (AGB) in a tropical forest in Southeast Asia. Three different texture-based methods (grey level co-occurrence metric (GLCM), Gabor wavelets and Fourier-based textural ordination (FOTO)) were used in conjunction with two different machine learning (ML)-based regression techniques (support vector regression (SVR) and random forest (RF) regression). These methods were implemented on both 50-cm resolution Digital Globe data extracted from Google Earth (TM) (GE) and 8-cm commercially obtained VHR imagery. This study further examines the role of forest biophysical parameters, such as ground-measured canopy cover and vertical canopy height, in explaining AGB distribution. Three models were developed using: (i) horizontal canopy variables (i.e., canopy cover and texture variables) plus vertical canopy height; (ii) horizontal variables only; and (iii) texture variables only. AGB was variable across the site, ranging from 51.02 Mg/ha to 356.34 Mg/ha. GE-based AGB estimates were comparable to those derived from commercial aerial imagery. The findings demonstrate that novel use of this array of texture-based techniques with GE imagery can help promote the wider use of freely available imagery for low-cost, fine-resolution monitoring of forests parameters at the landscape scale.

TI  - A hybrid artificial intelligence approach using GIS-based neural-fuzzy inference system and particle swarm optimization for forest fire susceptibility modeling at a tropical area
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
AB  - This paper proposes and validates a novel hybrid artificial intelligent approach, named as Particle Swarm Optimized Neural Fuzzy (PSO-NF), for spatial modeling of tropical forest fire susceptibility. In the proposed approach, a Neural Fuzzy inference system (NF) was used to establish the forest fire model whereas Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) was adopted to investigate the best values for the model parameters. Tropical forest at the province of Lam Dong (Central Highland of Vietnam) was used as a case study. For this purpose, historic forest fires and ten ignition factors (slope, aspect, elevation, land use, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, distance to road, distance to residence area, temperature, wind speed, and rainfall) were collected from various sources to construct a GIS database, and then, the database was used to develop and validate the proposed model. The performance of the forest model was assessed using the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve, area under the curve (AUC), and several statistical measures. The results showed that the proposed model performs well, both on the training dataset (AUC = 0.932) and the validation dataset (AUC = 0.916). The usability of the proposed model was further assessed through comparisons with those derived from two benchmark state-of-the art machine learning methods, Random Forests (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Because the performance of the proposed model is better than the two benchmark models, we concluded that the PSO-NF model is a valid alternative tool that should be considered for tropical forest fire susceptibility modeling. The result in this study is useful for forest planning and management in forest fire prone areas. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - The influence of spatial patterns of damping-off disease and arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization on tree seedling establishment in Ghanaian tropical forest soil
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
AB  - 1 Milicia regia (Moraceae) is a dioecious light-demanding (Pioneer) timber tree of West Africa. Experiments in shadehouses were used to examine the influence of light and soil source (beneath and away from conspecific adults) on mortality and growth of its seedlings in relation to fungal pathogens and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) colonization.
   2 The experiment in Ghana included treatments for light (2% and 20% of unshaded irradiance), three soil sources (under female, under male and 200 m distant from adults), and two different fungicide treatments.
   3 The results showed significant effects of irradiance, soil source and fungicide on both seedling mortality and accumulated biomass. Biomass was greater and mortality reduced at higher irradiance. Fungicide application reduced mortality in 2% irradiance, but had no significant effects at 20%, although AM infection of seedlings grown in soils from beneath adults was severely reduced. Mortality was greatest in soil from beneath female trees and least in soil distant from adult conspecifics. However, biomass in 20% irradiance was greater in soil from beneath females, possibly because of enhanced AM colonization: seedlings had a significantly higher percentage root length colonized by AM fungi beneath adult conspecifics, and biomass accumulation was significantly correlated with root length colonized by AM fungi.
   4 There were significant interactions amongst light, soil source and fungicide treatments that attest to the complexity of spatial effects on seedling establishment in tropical forest. Whilst there was clear evidence of pathogen-mediated effects that provides support for Janzen-Connell spacing mechanisms, and escape from the parent tree increases the chances of arriving in gaps, spatial differences in AM fungal communities may act in the opposite direction and enhance seedling growth close to adult conspecifics.
   5 The complexity of interactions between abiotic and biotic factors and the way in which these factors can vary spatially to affect seedling recruitment may be an important factor contributing to the maintenance of tree species diversity in tropical forests.

TI  - Deciphering African tropical forest dynamics in the Anthropocene: How social and historical sciences can elucidate forest cover change and inform forest management
T2  - ANTHROPOCENE
AB  - Forests bear the historical legacies of human activities over thousands of years, including agriculture, trade, disease and resource extraction. Many of these activities may represent indices of the proposed geological epoch of the Anthropocene. Modifications to soil, topography and vegetation evidence anthropogenic influences. Yet studies of vegetation change throughout the humid tropics tend to occlude these influences by focussing on forest dynamics, timber, and biodiversity through permanent sample plots or forestry inventory plots. We highlight how history and social science can be combined with ecology to help better understand human signatures in forest dynamics. We (1) critically review ecological methods in the light of the environmental and social history of the Afrotropics; (2) map current plot networks for West and Central Africa in relation to the Human Footprint Index; (3) using two case-studies, demonstrate how history and social science bring new insights and inferences to plot-based studies; all leading to (4) novel forms of interdisciplinary collaboration for sustainable forest conservation, management and restoration.

TI  - The Influence of Landscape Structure on the Occurrence of <i>Neospora caninum</i>, <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i>, and <i>Sarcocystis</i> spp. in Free-Living Neotropical Primates
T2  - ACTA PARASITOLOGICA
AB  - Purpose Habitat fragmentation is the main threat to primate survival in the world. Additionally, changes in the environments in which they live can also contribute to exposure to pathogens. To investigate some pathogens that free-living primates may be exposed to in Rio Grande do Sul State (RS; southern Brazil) and characterize the forest remnants in which they live, we investigated anti-Neospora caninum, Toxoplasma gondii, and Sarcocystis spp. antibodies in the serum of the animals. Methods We analyzed 105 serum samples from 63 black howler monkeys (Alouatta caraya), 39 southern brown howler monkeys (Alouatta guariba clamitans), and 03 capuchin monkeys (Sapajus nigritus cucullatus), which were captured in forest fragments of RS. Indirect fluorescence antibody test (IFAT) and indirect hemagglutination assay (IHA) were used to detect antibodies to the agents. We then characterized the landscapes in a multiscale approach in radii from 200 to 1400 m to investigate the relationship of the presence of the agents with landscape elements. Results In the IFAT-IgG, 13.3% (14/105) of the samples were seropositive for N. caninum, 4.8% (5/105) for T. gondii, and 5.7% (6/105) for Sarcocystis spp. In the IHA-IgM/IgG, 24.8% (26/105) were seropositive for T. gondii. The metrics that best explained exposure to agents were edge and patch density, forest cover, urban cover, and average Euclidean distance to the nearest patch. Conclusions This study indicated that the primates were exposed to the agents studied, demonstrating that some landscape features are associated with exposures to the investigated pathogens.

TI  - Tick-, Flea-, and Louse-Borne Diseases of Public Health and Veterinary Significance in Nigeria
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE
AB  - Mosquito-borne diseases are common high-impact diseases in tropical and subtropical areas. However, other non-mosquito vector-borne pathogens (VBPs) may share their geographic distribution, seasonality, and clinical manifestations, thereby contributing their share to the morbidity and mortality caused by febrile illnesses in these regions. The purpose of this work was to collect and review existing information and identify knowledge gaps about tick, flea-, and louse-borne diseases of veterinary and public health significance in Nigeria. Full-length articles about VBPs were reviewed and relevant information about the vectors, their hosts, geographic distribution, seasonality, and association(s) with human or veterinary diseases was extracted. Specific laboratory tools used for detection and identification of VBPs in Nigeria were also identified. A total of 62 original publications were examined. Substantial information about the prevalence and impacts of ticks and fleas on pet and service dogs (18 articles), and livestock animals (23 articles) were available; however, information about their association with and potential for causing human illnesses was largely absent despite the zoonotic nature of many of these peri-domestic veterinary diseases. Recent publications that employed molecular methods of detection demonstrated the occurrence of several classic (Ehrlichia canis, Rickettsia africae, Bartonella sp.) and emerging human pathogens (R. aeschlimannii, Neoehrlichia mikurensis) in ticks and fleas. However, information about other pathogens often found in association with ticks (R. conorii) and fleas (R. typhi, R. felis) across the African continent was lacking. Records of louse-borne epidemic typhus in Nigeria date to 1947; however, its current status is not known. This review provides an essential baseline summary of the current knowledge in Nigeria of non-mosquito VBPs, and should stimulate improvements in the surveillance of the veterinary and human diseases they cause in Nigeria. Due to increasing recognition of these diseases in other African countries, veterinary and public health professionals in Nigeria should expand the list of possible diseases considered in patients presenting with fever of unknown etiology.

TI  - Bee diversity along a disturbance gradient in tropical lowland forests of south-east Asia
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - 1. Bees are believed to be dominant pollen vectors in tropical forests, yet studies specific to bees in south-east Asia are rare. Regeneration and restoration of the rapidly disappearing lowland forests of this region are reliant on bees, thus there is an urgent need for forest bee data at the community level.
   2. Bee communities of eight forested sites in Johor (Malaysia) and Singapore were surveyed three times each from February to August 1999 at the below-canopy level. These sites ranged from relatively undisturbed primary lowland dipterocarp forests to late secondary forests and exotic forests, including an oil palm plantation. We attempted to elucidate the environmental factors that correlated with the distribution of bees.
   3. Bee abundance, in particular that of Apidae, was significantly higher in larger primary forests than other types of forests. However, bee species richness was higher in disturbed forests.
   4. The distribution of bees was apparently influenced by variables closely related to forest disturbance and resource abundance, such as the density of big trees (diameter at breast height 30-40 cm), temperature and flowering intensity of trees and shrubs.
   5. More stingless bees (Trigona spp.) were found where trees were larger and ambient conditions more constant but flowering intensities lower.
   6. The differences between the bee communities in forests of urban Singapore and primary forests in Johor may indicate that ecological processes in the forests of Singapore, in particular pollination, may be changing. However, pollination may not be totally intact in the primary forests surveyed, as their bee communities seemed to be depauperate.
   7. The role of important pollinators, especially bees, for the long-term survival of tropical lowland forests is poorly understood. Our study indicates that we urgently need more thorough understanding of pollination and pollinators, as some bee species appear to be disappearing from disturbed tropical lowland forests.

TI  - Landscape disturbance impacts on <i>Attalea butyracea</i> palm distribution in central Panama
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH GEOGRAPHICS
AB  - BackgroundIncreased Attalea butyracea palm propagation, notable for its role as key habitat for the primary Chagas disease vector in Panama, has been linked to landscape disturbance in single-palm observations in this region. Close proximity of these palms to human dwellings is proposed to increase risk of Chagas disease transmission from sylvatic transmission cycles to domestic transmission involving human populations. This study examines the relationship between landscape disturbance and mature A. butyracea spatial distribution, density, and proximity to human populations and vector and reservoir species' movement corridors at a regional scale in a 300 km(2) heterogeneous tropical landscape in central Panama.MethodsWe remotely identified the locations of over 50,000 mature A. butyracea palms using high-resolution WorldView2 satellite imagery. A local Getis-Ord Gi* spatial analysis identified significant clusters of aggregated palms. Associations between palm and cluster abundance and a landscape disturbance gradient, derived from official Panama land cover data, were tested using Chi-square tests for Homogeneity and Z-test for proportions. Kruskall-Wallis non-parametric analysis of variance tests were run to assess whether palm cluster area varied by disturbance level, or whether disturbance was associated with proximity of palms and palm clusters to susceptible populations or vector movement corridors.ResultsOur findings indicate a regional relationship between landscape disturbance and A. butyracea occurrence. We observe a significant increase in both individual and clustered A. butyracea in secondary forest, but a reduction of palms in agricultural settings. We do not detect evidence of any reduction in abundance of palms in residential settings. The majority of residential and commercial buildings in our study area are within vector flight distance of potential vector habitat in palm crowns.ConclusionsWe observe probable anthropogenic elimination of A. butyracea palms in agricultural, but not residential, settings. Even in heavily deforested regions, significant concentrations of mature palms remain in close proximity to human establishments.

TI  - Estimated Global Mortality Attributable to Smoke from Landscape Fires
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES
AB  - BACKGROUND: Forest, grass, and peat fires release approximately 2 petagrams of carbon into the atmosphere each year, influencing weather, climate, and air quality.
   OBJECTIVE: We estimated the annual global mortality attributable to landscape fire smoke (LFS).
   METHODS: Daily and annual exposure to particulate matter <= 2.5 mu m in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5) from fire emissions was estimated globally for 1997 through 2006 by combining outputs from a chemical transport model with satellite-based observations of aerosol optical depth. In World Health Organization (WHO) subregions classified as sporadically affected, the daily burden of mortality was estimated using previously published concentration-response coefficients for the association between short-term elevations in PM2.5 from LFS (contrasted with 0 mu g/m(3) from LFS) and all-cause mortality. In subregions classified as chronically affected, the annual burden of mortality was estimated using the American Cancer Society study coefficient for the association between long-term PM2.5 exposure and all-cause mortality. The annual average PM2.5 estimates were contrasted with theoretical minimum (counterfactual) concentrations in each chronically affected subregion. Sensitivity of mortality estimates to different exposure assessments, counterfactual estimates, and concentration-response functions was evaluated. Strong La Nina and El Nino years were compared to assess the influence of interannual climatic variability.
   RESULTS: Our principal estimate for the average mortality attributable to LFS exposure was 339,000 deaths annually. In sensitivity analyses the interquartile range of all tested estimates was 260,000-600,000. The regions most affected were sub-Saharan Africa (157,000) and Southeast Asia (110,000). Estimated annual mortality during La Nina was 262,000, compared with 532,000 during El Nino.
   CONCLUSIONS: Fire emissions are an important contributor to global mortality. Adverse health outcomes associated with LFS could be substantially reduced by curtailing burning of tropical rainforests, which rarely burn naturally. The large estimated influence of El Nino suggests a relationship between climate and the burden of mortality attributable to LFS.

TI  - Examining effective use of data sources and modeling algorithms for improving biomass estimation in a moist tropical forest of the Brazilian Amazon
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
AB  - Previous research has explored the potential to integrate lidar and optical data in aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation, but how different data sources, vegetation types, and modeling algorithms influence AGB estimation is poorly understood. This research conducts a comparative analysis of different data sources and modeling approaches in improving AGB estimation. RapidEye-based spectral responses and textures, lidar-derived metrics, and their combination were used to develop AGB estimation models. The results indicated that (1) overall, RapidEye data are not suitable for AGB estimation, but when AGB falls within 50-150Mg/ha, support vector regression based on stratification of vegetation types provided good AGB estimation; (2) Lidar data provided stable and better estimations than RapidEye data; and stratification of vegetation types cannot improve estimation; (3) The combination of lidar and RapidEye data cannot provide better performance than lidar data alone; (4) AGB ranges affect the selection of the best AGB models, and a combination of different estimation results from the best model for each AGB range can improve AGB estimation; (5) This research implies that an optimal procedure for AGB estimation for a specific study exists, depending on the careful selection of data sources, modeling algorithms, forest types, and AGB ranges.

Ongoing anthropogenic land use change is altering these species' abundance and distribution, which among zoonotic host species may increase the risk of zoonoses spillover events. A better understanding of the current distribution of rodent species is required to guide attempts to mitigate against potentially increased zoonotic disease hazard and risk. However, available species distribution and host-pathogen association datasets (e.g. IUCN, GBIF, CLOVER) are often taxonomically and spatially biased. Here, we synthesise data from West Africa from 127 rodent trapping studies, published between 1964-2022, as an additional source of information to characterise the range and presence of rodent species and identify the subgroup of species that are potential or known pathogen hosts. We identify that these rodent trapping studies, although biased towards human dominated landscapes across West Africa, can usefully complement current rodent species distribution datasets and we calculate the discrepancies between these datasets. For five regionally important zoonotic pathogens (Arenaviridae spp., Borrelia spp., Lassa mammarenavirus, Leptospira spp. and Toxoplasma gondii), we identify host-pathogen associations that have not been previously reported in host-association datasets. Finally, for these five pathogen groups, we find that the proportion of a rodent hosts range that have been sampled remains small with geographic clustering. A priority should be to sample rodent hosts across a greater geographic range to better characterise current and future risk of zoonotic spillover events. In the interim, studies of spatial pathogen risk informed by rodent distributions must incorporate a measure of the current sampling biases. The current synthesis of contextually rich rodent trapping data enriches available information from IUCN, GBIF and CLOVER which can support a more complete understanding of the hazard of zoonotic spillover events.
   Author summaryEmerging and endemic zoonotic diseases are projected to have increasing health impacts, particularly under changing climate and land-use scenarios. Rodents, an ecologically vital order of mammals carry a disproportionate number of zoonotic pathogens and are abundant across West Africa. Prior modelling studies rely on large, consolidated data sources which do not incorporate high resolution spatial and temporal data from rodent trapping studies. Here, we synthesise these studies to quantify the bias in the sampling of rodent hosts and their pathogens across West Africa. We find that rodent trapping studies are complementary to these datasets and can provide additional, high-resolution data on the distribution of hosts and their pathogens. Further, rodent trapping studies have identified additional potential host-pathogen associations than are recorded in consolidated host-pathogen association datasets. This can help to understand the risk of zoonotic diseases based on host distributions. Finally, we quantify the current extent of known rodent presence and pathogen sampling within a species range, highlighting that current knowledge is limited across much of the region. We hope that this will support work to study rodent hosts and their pathogens in currently under sampled regions to better understand the risk of emerging and endemic zoonoses in West Africa.

TI  - Effect of Habitat Disturbance on the Composition of Soil Nematode Functional Groups Associated with a Tropical Herb: <i>Heliconia collinsiana</i>
T2  - DIVERSITY-BASEL
AB  - Habitat loss affects the nature of biotic interactions in all ecosystems and at all levels of the food web. Nevertheless, little attention has been given to soil nematodes in tropical habitats despite their important role in ecosystem functioning worldwide. Here, we analyzed the influence of anthropogenic habitat disturbance on the absolute and relative density and composition (i.e., trophic guilds) of soil nematode communities associated with the rhizosphere of the tropical herb Heliconia collinsiana in continuous mature forests and human-induced secondary forests. We compared nematode densities based on the following feeding guilds: bacterivores, fungivores, herbivores and predators. Thereafter, we classified herbivorous nematodes into genera and described soil properties in both habitat types including pH, electrical conductivity, and organic matter content. Herbivores were significantly the most abundant feeding guild for both habitats represented by Criconemella spp., Helicotylenchus spp., and Meloidogyne spp., which showed no significant differences in density between habitats. Relative but not absolute nematode density differed between habitats, with fungivore nematodes being significantly lower in secondary forests. No significant differences in soil properties were detected. Overall, our results suggest that forest disturbance affects the nematode community associated with the rhizosphere of H. collinsiana which may affect forest succession and the dynamics of the soil biota. Our study contributes to the understanding of biotic interactions in conserved and disturbed tropical habitats.

TI  - Social Exclusion Modifies Climate and Deforestation Impacts on a Vector-Borne Disease
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background: The emergence of American Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (ACL) has been associated with changes in the relationship between people and forests, leading to the view that forest ecosystems increase infection risk and subsequent proposal that deforestation could reduce re-emergence of this disease.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We analyzed county-level incidence rates of ACL in Costa Rica (1996-2000) as a function of social and environmental variables relevant to transmission ecology with statistical models that incorporate breakpoints. Once social marginality was taken into account, the effect of living close to a forest on infection risk was small, and diminished exponentially above a breakpoint. Forest cover was associated with the modulation of temporal effects of El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) at small spatial scales, revealing an additional complex interplay of environmental forces and disease patterns.
   Conclusions/Significance: Social factors, which previously have not been evaluated rigorously together with environmental and climatic factors, appear to play a critical role that may ultimately determine disease risk.

TI  - Worldwide dynamic biogeography of zoonotic and anthroponotic dengue
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by mosquitoes. The rapid spread of dengue could lead to a global pandemic, and so the geographical extent of this spread needs to be assessed and predicted. There are also reasons to suggest that transmission of dengue from non-human primates in tropical forest cycles is being underestimated. We investigate the fine-scale geographic changes in transmission risk since the late 20(th) century, and take into account for the first time the potential role that primate biogeography and sylvatic vectors play in increasing the disease transmission risk. We apply a biogeographic framework to the most recent global dataset of dengue cases. Temporally stratified models describing favorable areas for vector presence and for disease transmission are combined. Our models were validated for predictive capacity, and point to a significant broadening of vector presence in tropical and non-tropical areas globally. We show that dengue transmission is likely to spread to affected areas in China, Papua New Guinea, Australia, USA, Colombia, Venezuela, Madagascar, as well as to cities in Europe and Japan. These models also suggest that dengue transmission is likely to spread to regions where there are presently no or very few reports of occurrence. According to our results, sylvatic dengue cycles account for a small percentage of the global extent of the human case record, but could be increasing in relevance in Asia, Africa, and South America. The spatial distribution of factors favoring transmission risk in different regions of the world allows for distinct management strategies to be prepared.
   Author summary The rate of disease emergence is increasing globally, and many long-existing diseases are extending their distribution ranges. This is the case for dengue, a global pandemic whose mosquito vectors are currently occupying ever-increasing numbers of regions worldwide. We updated the most complete global dataset of dengue cases available, and addressed the fine-scale analysis of the geographic changes experienced in dengue-transmission risk since the late 20(th) century. Our approach is the first to take into account the potential role of primates and sylvatic vectors in increasing the disease transmission risk in tropical forests. We built models that describe the favorable areas for vector presence and for disease occurrence, and combined them in order to obtain a novel model for predicting transmission risk. We show that dengue transmission is likely to spread to affected areas in Asia, Africa, North and South America, and Oceania, and to regions with presently no or very few cases, including cities in Europe and Japan. The global contribution of sylvatic dengue cycles is small but meaningful. Our methodological approach can differentiate the factors favoring risk in different world regions, thus allowing for management strategies to be prepared specifically for each of these regions.

TI  - Tropical Rainforests as Reservoirs for Emerging Zoonoses
T2  - BERLINER UND MUNCHENER TIERARZTLICHE WOCHENSCHRIFT
CP  - Symposium on One Health - Zoonoses by Virchow to Date
AB  - The last tropical rainforests are important reservoirs for yet unknown pathogens with zoonotic potential. Human intrusion into these former remote habitats through deforestation and bush meat hunting leads to an increased contact between humans and wildlife, and between humans and insect vectors (Leendertz et al., 2006; Jones et al., 2008; Gillespie et al., 2009). In the course of our research on pathogen transmission in this type of ecosystem, samples from non-human primates and other nammalian hosts living in tropical rainforests as well as humans living around rainforests are collected and analysed at the Robert Koch-Institut. One of the aims of our studies is to evaluate the risk of emergence of new zoonoses in the human population. We specifically focus on screening humans with high exposure to blood and organs of wild primates through bushmeat hunting and handling, but pathogen transmission from other possible hosts are also analysed.
   Chimpanzees can be seen as a "natural system" to study disease transmission among primates. In the last years we have shown that simian retroviruses, such as the Simian T-Cell Leukemia Virus-1 (STLV-1) and Foamy-Viruses (SFV) are transmitted from one non-human primate to another. Based on molecular epidemiological findings as well as prevalence data in different age classes of wild chimpanzees, we could show that the main transmission of these viruses is through the hunter-prey relationship that exists between red colobus monkeys and chimpanzees (Leendertz et al., 2004a, b; Leendertz et al., 2008). These findings in wild primates, which are known to be hunted by humans, inspired us to perform a study focused on the human population in the area together with the Institut Pasteur Cote d'Ivoire, and we found evidence of virus transmission from non-human primates to humans.
   Furthermore, we investigated several outbreaks of respiratory diseases in wild chimpanzees. In necropsy samples from deceased chimpanzees we detected two new strains of S. pneumoniae (Chi et al., 2007). In addition, the chimpanzees were infected with human paramyxoviruses (Kondgen et al., 2008). This was the first description of anthropoozonotic transmission of human respiratory viruses to great apes, identifying that human diseases are an important threat to these endangered species.
   In order to investigate the influence of ecological changes on the prevalence of mosquitoes and arboviruses, we systematically captured mosquitoes in and around tropical rainforests with different degrees of ecological changes. Firstly, we detected new viruses of the families Flavi-, Bunya- and Coronaviruses (Junglen et al., 2009), Secondly, we could show that ecological changes had a dramatic influence on the distribution and prevalence of mosquito and viruses, indicating that disturbance of the rainforest increases the risk of transmission of arboviruses to the human population (Junglen et al., in print).

TI  - The effect of deforestation on the human-biting rate of <i>Anopheles darlingi</i>, the primary vector of falciparum malaria in the Peruvian Amazon
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - To examine the impact of tropical rain-forest destruction on malaria, we conducted a year-long study of the rates at which the primary malaria vector in the Amazon, Anopheles darlingi, fed on humans in areas with varying degrees of ecological alteration in the Peruvian Amazon. Mosquitoes were collected by human biting catches along the Iquitos-Nauta road at sites selected for type of vegetation and controlled for human presence. Deforested sites had an A. darlingi biting rate that was more than 278 times higher than the rate determined for areas that were predominantly forested. Our results indicate that A. darlingi displays significantly increased human-biting activity in areas that have undergone deforestation and development associated with road development.

TI  - The patchiness of epifoliar fungi in tropical forests: Host range, host abundance, and environment
T2  - ECOLOGY
AB  - Fungal symbioses affect the diversity, dynamics, and spatial patterns of trees in tropical forests. Their ecological importance is partly driven by their inherent patchiness. We used epifoliar fungi, a guild of common, benign, obligate, fungal symbionts of plants, as a model system to evaluate the relative importance of host phylogeny, host relative abundance, and microclimate on the three-dimensional distribution of plant-fungus symbioses. In parallel studies in rainforests in Panama and Australia, most epifoliar fungi were able to colonize several plant lineages but showed significant host preferences within the local plant community. More closely related plant species were not more likely to share fungal symbionts. Instead, fungal species were more likely to be shared by more abundant hosts, which supported a greater number and diversity of fungi. Environmental conditions strongly affected spatial distributions, with sites in the dark understory 2.5- to fourfold more likely to have epifoliar fungi than in the exposed forest canopy. In the understory, fungal incidence increased with canopy openness. Canopy trees supported only a subset of the fungal symbionts found in the understory, suggesting that adult trees are not reservoirs of these fungal symbionts for understory juveniles.

TI  - Ground-Based Array for Tomographic Imaging of the Tropical Forest in P-Band
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
AB  - In this paper we discuss the design concepts and preliminary results relating to the European Space Agency's ground-based campaign TropiScat, whose main goal is to evaluate temporal coherence at P-band in a tropical forest in quad-polarization, considering temporal lags ranging from hours to months and at different heights within the vegetation layer. The experiment has been successfully set up and operated since October 2011 at the Paracou field station, French Guiana, where the equipment was installed on top of the 55-m high Guyaflux Tower to illuminate the forest below. The system consists of a vector network analyzer connected to 20 antennas through a switchbox, which allows the use of any of them either as a transmitter or as a receiver. Vertical imaging and fully polarimetric capabilities are achieved by operating the 20 antennas in a multistatic fashion, resulting in an equivalent monostatic array consisting of 15 phase centers displaced along the vertical direction in each polarization. Such a design allows unambiguous imaging of the vegetation while yielding a minimum distance between nearby antennas on the order of 0.8 m, so as to minimize coupling effects. The equipment allows the gathering of signals with the tomographic array within a few minutes, resulting in the possibility to produce a tomographic image of the forest with a temporal sampling of 15 min. System calibration and validation was performed by employing a 2-m trihedral reflector and a rotating dihedral reflector. This allowed the evaluation of the system pulse response in all polarizations and also assessment of the extent of tower motions. As a result, tomographic images have been generated from 500 (P-band) to 900 MHz in all polarizations. Results from real data acquired in Fall 2011 confirm the feasibility of carrying out reliable coherence measurements for the whole duration of the campaign.

TI  - Use of Poisson spatiotemporal regression models for the Brazilian Amazon forest: malaria count data
T2  - REVISTA DA SOCIEDADE BRASILEIRA DE MEDICINA TROPICAL
AB  - Introduction: Malaria is a serious problem in the Brazilian Amazon region, and the detection of possible risk factors could be of great interest for public health authorities. The objective of this article was to investigate the association between environmental variables and the yearly registers of malaria in the Amazon region using Bayesian spatiotemporal methods. Methods: We used Poisson spatiotemporal regression models to analyze the Brazilian Amazon forest malaria count for the period from 1999 to 2008. In this study, we included some covariates that could be important in the yearly prediction of malaria, such as deforestation rate. We obtained the inferences using a Bayesian approach and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to simulate samples for the joint posterior distribution of interest. The discrimination of different models was also discussed. Results: The model proposed here suggests that deforestation rate, the number of inhabitants per km(2), and the human development index (HDI) are important in the prediction of malaria cases. Conclusions: It is possible to conclude that human development, population growth, deforestation, and their associated ecological alterations are conducive to increasing malaria risk. We conclude that the use of Poisson regression models that capture the spatial and temporal effects under the Bayesian paradigm is a good strategy for modeling malaria counts.

TI  - Seasonal fluctuations of extracellular enzyme activities are related to the biogeochemical cycling of C, N and P in a tropical terra-firme forest
T2  - BIOGEOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Extracellular enzymes (EE) play a vital role in soil nutrient cycling and thus affect terrestrial ecosystem functioning. Yet the drivers that regulate microbial activity, and therefore EE activity, remain under debate. In this study we investigate the temporal variation of soil EE in a tropical terra-firme forest. We found that EE activity peaked during the drier season in association with increased leaf litterfall, which was also reflected in negative relationships between EE activities and precipitation. Soil nutrients were weakly related to EE activities, although extractable N was related to EE activities in the top 5 cm of the soil. These results suggest that soil EE activity is synchronized with precipitation-driven substrate inputs and depends on the availability of N. Our results further indicate high investments in P acquisition, with a higher microbial N demand in the month before the onset of the drier season, shifting to higher P demand towards the end of the drier season. These seasonal fluctuations in the potential acquisition of essential resources imply dynamic shifts in microbial activity in coordination with climate seasonality and resource limitation of central-eastern Amazon forests.

TI  - Review of Climate, Landscape, and Viral Genetics as Drivers of the Japanese Encephalitis Virus Ecology
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - The Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), an arthropod-born Flavivirus, is the major cause of viral encephalitis, responsible for 10,000-15,000 deaths each year, yet is a neglected tropical disease. Since the JEV distribution area has been large and continuously extending toward new Asian and Australasian regions, it is considered an emerging and reemerging pathogen. Despite large effective immunization campaigns, Japanese encephalitis remains a disease of global health concern. JEV zoonotic transmission cycles may be either wild or domestic: the first involves wading birds as wild amplifying hosts; the second involves pigs as the main domestic amplifying hosts. Culex mosquito species, especially Cx. tritaeniorhynchus, are the main competent vectors. Although five JEV genotypes circulate, neither clear-cut genotype-phenotype relationship nor clear variations in genotype fitness to hosts or vectors have been identified. Instead, the molecular epidemiology appears highly dependent on vectors, hosts' biology, and on a set of environmental factors. At global scale, climate, land cover, and land use, otherwise strongly dependent on human activities, affect the abundance of JEV vectors, and of wild and domestic hosts. Chiefly, the increase of rice-cultivated surface, intensively used by wading birds, and of pig production in Asia has provided a high availability of resources to mosquito vectors, enhancing the JEV maintenance, amplification, and transmission. At fine scale, the characteristics (density, size, spatial arrangement) of three landscape elements (paddy fields, pig farms, human habitations) facilitate or impede movement of vectors, then determine how the JEV interacts with hosts and vectors and ultimately the infection risk to humans. If the JEV is introduced in a favorable landscape, either by live infected animals or by vectors, then the virus can emerge and become a major threat for human health. Multidisciplinary research is essential to shed light on the biological mechanisms involved in the emergence, spread, reemergence, and genotypic changes of JEV.

TI  - Biology of Phlebotomine Sand Flies as Vectors of Disease Agents
T2  - ANNUAL REVIEW OF ENTOMOLOGY, VOL 58
AB  - Phlebotomines are the sole or principal vectors of Leishmania, Bartonella bacilliformis, and some arboviruses. The coevolution of sand flies with Leishmania species of mammals and lizards is considered in relation to the landscape epidemiology of leishmaniasis, a neglected tropical disease. Evolutionary hypotheses are unresolved, so a practical phlebotomine classification is proposed to aid biomedical information retrieval. The vectors of Leishmania are tabulated and new criteria for their incrimination are given. Research on fly-parasite-host interactions, fly saliva, and behavioral ecology is reviewed in relation to parasite manipulation of blood feeding, vaccine targets, and pheromones for lures. Much basic research is based on few transmission cycles, so generalizations should be made with caution. Integrated research and control programs have begun, but improved control of leishmaniasis and nuisance-biting requires greater emphasis on population genetics and transmission modeling. Most leishmaniasis transmission is zoonotic, affecting the poor and tourists in rural and natural areas, and therefore control should be compatible with environmental conservation.

TI  - Assessing changes of carbon stock in dipterocarp forest due to hydro-electric dam construction in Malaysia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB  - Deforestation and forest degradation are among the leading global concerns, as they could reduce the carbon sink and sequestration potential of the forest. The impoundment of Kenyir River, Hulu Terengganu, Malaysia, in 1985 due to the development of hydropower station has created a large area of water bodies following clearance of forested land. This study assessed the loss of forest carbon due to these activities within the period of 37 years, between 1972 and 2019. The study area consisted of Kenyir Lake catchment area, which consisted mainly of forests and the great Kenyir Lake. Remote sensing datasets have been used in this analysis. Satellite images from Landsat 1-5 MSS and Landsat 8 OLI/TRIS that were acquired between the years 1972 and 2019 were used to classify land uses in the entire landscape of Kenyir Lake catchment. Support vector machine (SVM) was adapted to generate the land-use classification map in the study area. The results show that the total study area includes 278,179 ha and forest covers dominated the area for before and after the impoundment of Kenyir Lake. The assessed loss of carbon between the years 1972 and 2019 was around 8.6 million Mg C with an annual rate of 0.36%. The main single cause attributing to the forest loss was due to clearing of forest for hydro-electric dam construction. However, the remaining forests surrounding the study area are still able to sequester carbon at a considerable rate and thus balance the carbon dynamics within the landscapes. The results highlight that carbon sequestration scenario in Kenyir Lake catchment area shows the potential of the carbon sink in the study area are acceptable with only 17% reduction of sequestration ability. The landscape of the study area is considered as highly vegetated area despite changes due to dam construction.

TI  - Amazonia revealed: forest degradation and loss of ecosystem goods and services in the Amazon Basin
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
AB  - The Amazon Basin is one of the world's most important bioregions, harboring a rich array of plant and animal species and offering a wealth of goods and services to society. For years, ecological science has shown how large-scale forest clearings cause declines in biodiversity and the availability of forest products. Yet some important changes in the rainforests, and in the ecosystem services they provide, have been underappreciated until recently. Emerging research indicates that land use in the Amazon goes far beyond clearing large areas of forest; selective logging and other canopy damage is much more pervasive than once believed. Deforestation causes collateral damage to the surrounding forests-through enhanced drying of the forest floor, increased frequency of fires, and lowered productivity. The loss of healthy forests can degrade key ecosystem services, such as carbon storage in biomass and soils, the regulation of water balance and river flow, the modulation of regional climate patterns, and the amelioration of infectious diseases. We review these newly revealed changes in the Amazon rainforests and the ecosystem services that they provide.

TI  - Hantavirus host assemblages and human disease in the Atlantic Forest
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Several viruses from the genus Orthohantavirus are known to cause lethal disease in humans. Sigmodontinae rodents are the main hosts responsible for hantavirus transmission in the tropical forests, savannas, and wetlands of South America. These rodents can shed different hantaviruses, such as the lethal and emerging Araraquara orthohantavirus. Factors that drive variation in host populations may influence hantavirus transmission dynamics within and between populations. Landscape structure, and particularly areas with a predominance of agricultural land and forest remnants, is expected to influence the proportion of hantavirus rodent hosts in the Atlantic Forest rodent community. Here, we tested this using 283 Atlantic Forest rodent capture records and geographically weighted models that allow us to test if predictors vary spatially. We also assessed the correspondence between proportions of hantavirus hosts in rodent communities and a human vulnerability to hantavirus infection index across the entire Atlantic Forest biome. We found that hantavirus host proportions were more positively influenced by landscape diversity than by a particular habitat or agricultural matrix type. Local small mammal diversity also positively influenced known pathogenic hantavirus host proportions, indicating that a plasticity to habitat quality may be more important for these hosts than competition with native forest dwelling species. We found a consistent positive effect of sugarcane and tree plantation on the proportion of rodent hosts, whereas defaunation intensity did not correlate with the proportion of hosts of potentially pathogenic hantavirus genotypes in the community, indicating that non-defaunated areas can also be hotspots for hantavirus disease outbreaks. The spatial match between host hotspots and human disease vulnerability was 17%, while coldspots matched 20%. Overall, we discovered strong spatial and land use change influences on hantavirus hosts at the landscape level across the Atlantic Forest. Our findings suggest disease surveillance must be reinforced in the southern and southeastern regions of the biome where the highest predicted hantavirus host proportion and levels of vulnerability spatially match. Importantly, our analyses suggest there may be more complex rodent community dynamics and interactions with human disease than currently hypothesized.

TI  - Identification of Significative LiDAR Metrics and Comparison of Machine Learning Approaches for Estimating Stand and Diversity Variables in Heterogeneous Brazilian Atlantic Forest
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Data collection and estimation of variables that describe the structure of tropical forests, diversity, and richness of tree species are challenging tasks. Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) is a powerful technique due to its ability to penetrate small openings and cracks in the forest canopy, enabling the collection of structural information in complex forests. Our objective was to identify the most significant LiDAR metrics and machine learning techniques to estimate the stand and diversity variables in a disturbed heterogeneous tropical forest. Data were collected in a remnant of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest with different successional stages. LiDAR metrics were used in three types of transformation: (i) raw data (untransformed), (ii) correlation analysis, and (iii) principal component analysis (PCA). These transformations were tested with four machine learning techniques: (i) artificial neural network (ANN), ordinary least squares (OLS), random forests (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) with different configurations resulting in 27 combinations. The best technique was determined based on the lowest RMSE (%) and corrected Akaike information criterion (AICc), and bias (%) values close to zero. The output forest variables were mean diameter at breast height (MDBH), quadratic mean diameter (QMD), basal area (BA), density (DEN), number of tree species (NTS), as well as Shannon-Waver (H') and Simpson's diversity indices (D). The best input data were the new variables obtained from the PCA, and the best modeling method was ANN with two hidden layers for the variables MDBH, QMD, BA, and DEN while for NTS, H'and D, the ANN with three hidden layers were the best methods. For MDBH, QMD, H'and D, the RMSE was 5.2-10% with a bias between -1.7% and 3.6%. The BA, DEN, and NTS were the most difficult variables to estimate, due to their complexity in tropical forests; the RMSE was 16.2-27.6% and the bias between -12.4% and -0.24%. The results showed that it is possible to estimate the stand and diversity variables in heterogeneous forests with LiDAR data.

TI  - Antiviral evaluation of plants from Brazilian Atlantic Tropical Forest
T2  - FITOTERAPIA
AB  - The antiviral activity of six medicinal plants from Brazilian Atlantic Tropical Forest was investigated against two viruses: Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and poliovirus type 2 (PV-2). Cuphea carthagenensis and Tillandsia usneoides extracts showed the best antiherpes activity. T usneoides dichloromethane, ethyl acetate and n-butanol extracts, and Lippia alba n-butanol extract showed inhibition of HSV-1, strain 29R/acyclovir resistant. In addition, only L. alba ethyl acetate extract showed antipoliovirus activity. These results corroborate that medicinal plants can be a rich source of potential antiviral compounds.

TI  - Improving the Spatial Prediction of Soil Organic Carbon Stocks in a Complex Tropical Mountain Landscape by Methodological Specifications in Machine Learning Approaches
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Tropical forests are significant carbon sinks and their soils' carbon storage potential is immense. However, little is known about the soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks of tropical mountain areas whose complex soil-landscape and difficult accessibility pose a challenge to spatial analysis. The choice of methodology for spatial prediction is of high importance to improve the expected poor model results in case of low predictor-response correlations. Four aspects were considered to improve model performance in predicting SOC stocks of the organic layer of a tropical mountain forest landscape: Different spatial predictor settings, predictor selection strategies, various machine learning algorithms and model tuning. Five machine learning algorithms: random forests, artificial neural networks, multivariate adaptive regression splines, boosted regression trees and support vector machines were trained and tuned to predict SOC stocks from predictors derived from a digital elevation model and satellite image. Topographical predictors were calculated with a GIS search radius of 45 to 615 m. Finally, three predictor selection strategies were applied to the total set of 236 predictors. All machine learning algorithms-including the model tuning and predictor selection-were compared via five repetitions of a tenfold cross-validation. The boosted regression tree algorithm resulted in the overall best model. SOC stocks ranged between 0.2 to 17.7 kg m(-2), displaying a huge variability with diffuse insolation and curvatures of different scale guiding the spatial pattern. Predictor selection and model tuning improved the models' predictive performance in all five machine learning algorithms. The rather low number of selected predictors favours forward compared to backward selection procedures. Choosing predictors due to their indiviual performance was vanquished by the two procedures which accounted for predictor interaction.

TI  - Disappearing forests of Uganda: The way forward
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
AB  - Encroachment on state lands is a common practice in Uganda. Forest reserves are a form of state land under forest cover of either high land tropical forest (HLTF) or low land moist forest (LMF), and woodlands. Deforestation is eminent in Uganda considering the reduction of forest cover from the precolonial days to present.
   Forest clearance for agriculture in southwestern Uganda montane forests is thought to have begun some 2200 years ago with arrival of Bantu-speaking peoples who had iron-smelting technology. These ethnic groups encountered the Batwa (pygmies) people, who traded forest products for food, a scenario that initiated accelerated deforestation.
   Deforestation in Uganda has reduced the ecological interactions that support sharing of resources. These include light, temperature, rainfall, wind, humidity, pests, diseases, symbiots, soil nutrients, organic matter, moisture and space. As a result areas which were formally under forest cover now hardly support any plant life. Efforts are being made to contain the situation by adopting collaborative forest management, enacting laws and regulations that can help guide forest conservation.

TI  - Plant diversity in tropical forests: a review of mechanisms of species coexistence
T2  - OECOLOGIA
AB  - Evidence concerning mechanisms hypothesized to explain species coexistence in hyper-diverse communities is reviewed for tropical forest plants. Three hypotheses receive strong support. Niche differences are evident from non-random spatial distributions along micro-topographic gradients and from a survivorship-growth tradeoff during regeneration. Host-specific pests reduce recruitment near reproductive adults (the Janzen-Connell effect), and, negative density dependence occurs over larger spatial scales among the more abundant species and may regulate their populations. A fourth hypothesis, that suppressed understory plants rarely come into competition with one another, has not been considered before and has profound implications for species coexistence. These hypotheses are mutually compatible. Infrequent competition among suppressed understory plants, niche differences, and Janzen-Connell effects may facilitate the coexistence of the many rare plant species found in tropical forests while negative density dependence regulates the few most successful and abundant species.

TI  - Effects of landscape anthropization on sylvatic mosquito assemblages in a rainforest in Chiapas, Mexico
T2  - ACTA TROPICA
AB  - Global change and ecosystem transformation at regional and local scales during recent decades have facilitated the exponential increase of outbreaks of mosquito-borne diseases. Mosquito-borne pathogens are responsible for millions of infections, mainly in tropical regions where marginalized human populations are located, and where in recent years processes of landscape anthropization have occurred. Anthropogenic landscape transformation is known to change species assemblages. However, the magnitude of these effects is largely unknown, and the effects of anthropogenic landscape transformation on sylvatic mosquito assemblages are poorly known in Mexican ecosystems. We evaluate how mosquito abundance, richness, and diversity change along a gradient of three human-modified landscapes?one highly anthropized, one moderately anthropized, and one slightly anthropized?within a tropical forest matrix in a Protected Natural Area in Chiapas. A total of 4 538 mosquitoes belonging to 23 species were captured and identified at the three sites. We found differences in the structure and abundance of the three mosquito assemblages. The species assemblage of the highly anthropized site was significantly different from the other sites, and the relative abundance of the assemblages increased with landscape anthropization. Our results suggest that landscape anthropization alters the composition and structure of mosquito assemblages, modifying the abundance and species richness of mosquitoes associated with sylvatic ecosystems. This could support the hypothesis of intermediate disturbance that suggests the diversity is maxi-mized when late and early successional species coexist in these ecosystems. This information is essential to understand the ecology of potential sylvatic vectors and the environmental factors that are involved in the emergence and re-emergence of mosquito-borne diseases.

TI  - Overcoming the Challenges of Mosquito (Diptera: Culicidae) Sampling in Remote Localities: A Comparison of CO<sub>2</sub> Attractants on Mosquito Communities in Three Tropical Forest Habitats
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - Emerging infectious diseases are on the rise with future outbreaks predicted to occur in frontier regions of tropical countries. Disease surveillance in these hotspots is challenging because sampling techniques often rely on vector attractants that are either unavailable in remote localities or difficult to transport. We examined whether a novel method for producing CO2 from yeast and sugar produces similar mosquito species captures compared with a standard attractant such as dry ice. Across three different vegetation communities, we found traps baited with dry ice frequently captured more mosquitoes than yeast-baited traps; however, there was little effect on mosquito community composition. Based on our preliminary experiments, we find that this method of producing CO2 is a realistic alternative to dry ice and would be highly suitable for remote field work.

TI  - A novel landscape genetic approach demonstrates the effects of human disturbance on the Udzungwa red colobus monkey (<i>Procolobus gordonorum</i>)
T2  - HEREDITY
AB  - A comprehensive understanding of how human disturbance affects tropical forest ecosystems is critical for the mitigation of future losses in global biodiversity. Although many genetic studies of tropical forest fragmentation have been conducted to provide insight into this issue, relatively few have incorporated landscape data to explicitly test the effects of human disturbance on genetic differentiation among populations. In this study, we use a newly developed landscape genetic approach that relies on a genetic algorithm to simultaneously optimize resistance surfaces to investigate the effects of human disturbance in the Udzungwa Mountains of Tanzania, which is an important part of a universally recognized biodiversity hotspot. Our study species is the endangered Udzungwa red colobus monkey (Procolobus gordonorum), which is endemic to the Udzungwa Mountains and a known indicator species that thrives in large and well-protected blocks of old growth forest. Population genetic analyses identified significant population structure among Udzungwa red colobus inhabiting different forest blocks, and Bayesian cluster analyses identified hierarchical structure. Our new method for creating composite landscape resistance models found that the combination of fire density on the landscape and distance to the nearest village best explains the genetic structure observed. These results demonstrate the effects that human activities are having in an area of high global conservation priority and suggest that this ecosystem is in a precarious state. Our study also illustrates the ability of our novel landscape genetic method to detect the impacts of relatively recent landscape features on a long-lived species.

TI  - A systematic comparison of deforestation drivers and policy effectiveness across the Amazon biome
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - The Amazon biome, spanning nine countries, has one of the highest rates of deforestation worldwide. This deforestation contributes to biodiversity loss, climate change, the spread of infectious diseases, and damage to rural and indigenous livelihoods. Hundreds of articles have been published on the topic of deforestation across Amazonia, yet there has been no recent synthesis of deforestation drivers and deforestation-control policy effectiveness in the region. Here we undertook the first systematic review of papers published between 2000 and 2021 that have causally linked proximate and underlying drivers and policies to deforestation outcomes in Amazonia. In the 155 articles that met our inclusion criteria, we find that causal research is concentrated in Brazil, and to a lesser degree Peru, Ecuador, and Bolivia. There has been little study of the Guianas, Venezuela or Colombia. Large- and small-scale agriculture linked to improved market access and high agricultural prices are frequently researched underlying drivers of deforestation across the heavily researched regions. In the Guianas research focuses on mining with little focus on underlying causes. Research on infrastructure expansion, mining, and oil extraction and on technological, sociocultural, and institutional factors remains sparse. Many public and private policies have been found to be effective in controlling deforestation across the biome, with protected areas and public policies standing out as particularly successful in slowing deforestation vis-a-vis supply chain approaches. Frontier age, land tenure, and policy interactions are key moderating factors affecting the outcomes of different underlying causes and policies. Our findings indicate a greater need for research on (i) additional deforestation drivers beyond agriculture and economic factors, (ii) the complex interactions between different drivers and deforestation control policies, (iii) causes underlying deforestation in low or new deforestation areas, and (iv) the dynamics between Amazonian subregions and countries. Understanding the extent and diversity of deforestation drivers and effectiveness of existing deforestation mitigation policies across Amazonia is a necessary first step toward designing policies to further reduce deforestation in the biome.

TI  - Organic forms dominate hydrologic nitrogen export from a lowland tropical watershed
T2  - ECOLOGY
AB  - Observations of high dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) concentrations in stream water have reinforced the notion that primary tropical rain forests cycle nitrogen (N) in relative excess compared to phosphorus. Here we test this notion by evaluating hydrologic N export from a small watershed on the Osa Peninsula, Costa Rica, where prior research has shown multiple indicators of conservative N cycling throughout the ecosystem. We repeatedly measured a host of factors known to influence N export for one year, including stream water chemistry and upslope litterfall, soil N availability and net N processing rates, and soil solution chemistry at the surface, 15- and 50-cm depths. Contrary to prevailing assumptions about the lowland N cycle, we find that dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) averaged 85% of dissolved N export for 48 of 52 consecutive weeks. For most of the year stream water nitrate (NO3-) export was very low, which reflected minimal net N processing and DIN leaching from upslope soils. Yet, for one month in the dry season, NO3- was the major component of N export due to a combination of low flows and upslope nitrification that concentrated NO3- in stream water. Particulate organic N (PON) export was much larger than dissolved forms at 14.6 kg N . ha(-1) . yr(-1), driven by soil erosion during storms. At this rate, PON export was slightly greater than estimated inputs from free-living N fixation and atmospheric N deposition, which suggests that erosion-driven PON export could constrain ecosystem level N stocks over longer timescales. This phenomenon is complimentary to the "DON leak'' hypothesis, which postulates that the long-term accumulation of ecosystem N in unpolluted ecosystems is constrained by the export of organic N independently of biological N demand. Using an established global sediment generation model, we illustrate that PON erosion may be an important vector for N loss in tropical landscapes that are geomorphically active. This study supports an emerging view that landscape geomorphology influences nutrient biogeochemistry and limitation, though more research is needed to understand the mechanisms and spatial significance of erosional N loss from terrestrial ecosystems.

TI  - Aboveground biomass stock and change estimation in Amazon rainforest using airborne light detection and ranging, multispectral data, and machine learning algorithms
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Developing an efficient method to accurately estimate aboveground biomass in tropical forests is critical to monitoring the carbon stock and implementing policies to reduce emissions caused by deforestation. Thus, the objective of the present study was to estimate aboveground biomass in areas of the Amazonian Forest with selective logging, using the random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and artificial neural network (ANN) machine learning algorithms, using light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data and these combined with OLI/Landsat 8 variables, as well as mapping the biomass for the years 2014 and 2017, allowing one to analyze its dynamics between the years of analysis. The RF and SVM algorithms obtained the lowest error values in all datasets. The association of the variables increased the RF performance. Analyzing the dynamics of biomass, it was observed that the oldest exploration units (2006, 2007, and 2008) have lower biomass stocks. The highest biomass losses in 2017 came from units operated between 2012 and 2013 (the most recent record). Thus, with the method used in this study, it was possible to infer that the machine learning algorithms were efficient in estimating the biomass, emphasizing the RF and the SVM.

CP  - IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)
AB  - This study aims to evaluate the texture analysis of high spatial resolution images for mapping tropical forests. More precisely, it evaluates the potential of TerraSAR-X image, with spatial resolution of 0.5 meter for the classification of tropical forests located in southern Cambodia. In particular, the focus is put on the contribution of the analysis of textural information for classification. This latter is apprehended through the analysis of Haralick textural parameters. The retained algorithm of classification is the Support Vector Machine, as it allows taking into account numerous parameters, which can be heterogeneous with respect to their physical dimension. First results show that the addition of Haralick parameters to intensity channel may improve significantly the accuracy of the classification results. However, their performance for classification discrimination strongly depends on the size of the neighborhood from which they are estimated. Preliminary analysis of variograms allows optimizing the choice of the neighborhood size. Best results are obtained with a 25x25 sliding window size, with a classification accuracy improvement higher than 50% is observed.

TI  - <i>Paenibacillus lautus</i>, an opportunistic bacterial pathogen, isolated from Ixodes granulatus Supino (Acari: Ixodidae) collected from a Muller's giant Sunda rat (<i>Sundamys muelleri</i>)
T2  - SYSTEMATIC AND APPLIED ACAROLOGY
AB  - Wild rodents are carriers of ectoparasites such as ticks that are vectors of infectious diseases with human and veterinary significances. Due to their close association with human dwellings, synanthropic wild rodents may aid the spread and transmission of tick-borne pathogens. In light of this, an effort was initiated to study the cultivable bacteria within ticks collected from wild rodents trapped in Sungai Congkak Recreational Forest, Selangor. Ticks collected from four different rodent species; Sundamys muelleri, Maxomys whiteheadi, Maxomys rajah and Rattus rattus, were sterilely homogenized and cultured. One unique bacterial isolate originating from an engorged adult female Ixodes granulatus Supino collected off a Sundamys muelleri rat was identified as Paenibacilus lautus via 16S rDNA, ctpA sequencing and biochemical tests. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed that the P. lautus isolate was resistant to ampicillin, penicillin, clindamycin, chloramphenicol, rifampicin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, mirroring the antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of clinical strains. Recovery of this opportunistic bacterial pathogen from the tick suggests that it may be transmitted to humans or other hosts through tick bites and cause disease once it enters the bloodstream. Therefore, it is important to remain vigilant due to its pathogenic potential and improve our waste disposal practices to avoid attracting rodents.

TI  - Shifts in mosquito diversity and abundance along a gradient from oil palm plantations to conterminous forests in Borneo
T2  - ECOSPHERE
AB  - Deforestation precipitates spillover of enzootic, vector-borne viruses into humans, but specific mechanisms for this effect have rarely been investigated. Expansion of oil palm cultivation is a major driver of deforestation. Here, we demonstrate that mosquito abundance decreased over ten stepwise distances from interior forest into conterminous palm plantations in Borneo. Diversity in interior plantation narrowed to one species, Aedes albopictus, a potential bridge vector for spillover of multiple viruses. A. albopictus was equally abundant across all distances in forests, forest-plantation edge, and plantations, while A. niveus, a known vector of sylvatic dengue virus, was found only in forests. A. albopictus collections were significantly female-biased in plantation but not in edge or forest. Our data reveal that the likelihood of encountering any mosquito is greater in interior forest and edge than plantation, while the likelihood of encountering A. albopictus is equivalent across the gradient sampled from interior plantation to interior forest.

TI  - Tropical savanna small mammals respond to loss of cover following disturbance: A global review of field studies
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB  - Small-mammal faunas of tropical savannas consist of endemic assemblages of murid rodents, small marsupials, and insectivores on four continents. Small mammals in tropical savannas are understudied compared to other tropical habitats and other taxonomic groups (e.g., Afrotropical megafauna or Neotropical rainforest mammals). Their importance as prey, ecosystem engineers, disease reservoirs, and declining members of endemic biodiversity in tropical savannas compels us to understand the factors that regulate their abundance and diversity. We reviewed field studies published in the last 35 years that examined, mostly experimentally, the effects of varying three primary endogenous disturbances in tropical savanna ecosystems-fire, large mammalian herbivory (LMH), and drought-on abundance and diversity of non-volant small mammals. These disturbances are most likely to affect habitat structure (cover or concealment), food availability, or both, for ground-dwelling small mammalian herbivores, omnivores, and insectivores. Of 63 studies (included in 55 published papers) meeting these criteria from the Afrotropics, Neotropics, and northern Australia (none was found from southern Asia), 29 studies concluded that small mammals responded (mostly negatively) to a loss of cover (mostly from LMH and fire); four found evidence of increased predation on small mammals in lower-cover treatments (e.g., grazed or burned). Eighteen studies concluded a combination of food- and cover-limitation explained small-mammal responses to endogenous disturbances. Only two studies concluded small-mammal declines in response to habitat-altering disturbance were caused by food limitation and not related to cover reduction. Evidence to date indicates that abundance and richness of small savanna mammals, in general (with important exceptions), is enhanced by vegetative cover (especially tall grass, but sometimes shrub cover) as refugia for these prey species amid a "landscape of fear," particularly for diurnal, non-cursorial, and non-fossorial species. These species have been called "decreasers" in response to cover reduction, whereas a minority of small-mammal species have been shown to be "increasers" or disturbance-tolerant. Complex relationships between endogenous disturbances and small-mammal food resources are important secondary factors, but only six studies manipulated or measured food resources simultaneous to habitat manipulations. While more such studies are needed, designing effective ones for cryptic consumer communities of omnivorous dietary opportunists is a significant challenge.

T2  - 2022 IEEE INTERNATIONAL GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING SYMPOSIUM (IGARSS 2022)
CP  - IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)
AB  - Multitemporal Hyperion/EO-1 images acquired at both nadir and off-nadir configurations were evaluated for characterization of above-ground biomass (AGB) and plant area index (PAI). Field measurements were conducted in areas of primary forest and three successional forest stages (e.g., initial, intermediate, and advanced) in Eastern Amazon (Brazil). Support vector regression (SVR) was applied using surface reflectance values as input variables. Results showed that vegetation anisotropy influenced correlations values. Narrow and broadband vegetation indices were strongly affected according to the sun-view angle configuration. Improvements of up to 30Mg.ha(-1) are found for the prediction of AGB according to the selection of the data acquisition. The best results for the biomass characterization were found in the scenes acquired in the backscattering direction and at nadir under a lower sun zenith configuration. The results reveal therefore the importance of a proper geometry configuration selection for the forthcoming Hyperspectral missions.

TI  - Exposure of free-ranging maned wolves (<i>Chrysocyon brachyurus</i>) to infectious and parasitic disease agents in the Noel Kempff Mercado National Park, Bolivia
T2  - JOURNAL OF ZOO AND WILDLIFE MEDICINE
AB  - Maned wolves (Chrysocyon brachyurus) are neotropic mammals, listed as a CITES Appendix 11 species, with a distribution south of the Amazon forest from Bolivia, through northern Argentina and Paraguay and into eastern Brazil and northern Uruguay. Primary threats to the survival of free-ranging maned wolves include habitat loss, road kills, and shooting by farmers. An additional threat to the conservation of maned wolves is the risk of morbidity and mortality due to infectious and parasitic diseases. Captive maned wolves are susceptible to, and die from, common infectious diseases of domestic dogs (Canis Jamiliaris) including canine distemper virus (CDV), canine parvovirus (CPV), rabies virus, and canine adenovirus (CAV). Results from this study show that free-ranging maned wolves in a remote area of Bolivia have been exposed to multiple infectious and parasitic agents of domestic carnivores, including CAV, CDV, CPV, canine coronavirus, rabies virus, Leptospira interrogans spp., Toxoplasma gondii, and Dirafilaria immitis, and may be at increased risk for disease due to these agents.

TI  - Assessing amphibian disease risk across tropical streams while accounting for imperfect pathogen detection
T2  - OECOLOGIA
AB  - Ecologists studying emerging wildlife diseases need to confront the realism of imperfect pathogen detection across heterogeneous habitats to aid in conservation decisions. For example, spatial risk assessments of amphibian disease caused by Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) has largely ignored imperfect pathogen detection across sampling sites. Because changes in pathogenicity and host susceptibility could trigger recurrent population declines, it is imperative to understand how pathogen prevalence and occupancy vary across environmental gradients. Here, we assessed how Bd occurrence, prevalence, and infection intensity in a diverse Neotropical landscape vary across streams in relation to abiotic and biotic predictors using a hierarchical Bayesian model that accounts for imperfect Bd detection caused by qPCR error. Our model indicated that the number of streams harboring Bd-infected frogs is higher than observed, with Bd likely being present at 43% more streams than it was detected. We found that terrestrial-breeders captured along streams had higher Bd prevalence, but lower infection intensity, than aquatic-breeding species. We found a positive relationship between Bd occupancy probability and stream density, and a negative relationship between Bd occupancy probability and amphibian local richness. Forest cover was a weak predictor of Bd occurrence and infection intensity. Finally, we provide estimates for the minimum number of amphibian captures needed to determine the presence of Bd at a given site where Bd occurs, thus, providing guidence for cost-effective disease risk monitoring programs.

TI  - Risk factors for cutaneous leishmaniasis in a high-altitude forest region of Peru
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HEALTH
AB  - Background American cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a neglected tropical disease typically associated with men working in remote, sylvatic environments. We sought to identify CL risk factors in a highly deforested region where anecdotal reports suggested an atypical proportion of women and children were infected with CL raising concern among authorities that transmission was shifting towards domestic spaces and population centers. Methods We describe the characteristics of CL patients from four participating clinics after digitizing up to 10 years of patient data from each clinic's CL registries. We assessed risk factors of CL associated with intradomestic, peridomestic, or non-domestic transmission through a matched case-control study with 63 patients who had visited these same clinics for CL (cases) or other medical reasons (controls) between January 2014 and August 2016. The study consisted of an in-home interview of participants by a trained field worker using a standard questionnaire. Risk factors were identified using bivariable and multivariable conditional logistic regression. Results Between 2007 and 2016, a total of 529 confirmed CL positives were recorded in the available CL registries. Children and working aged women made up 58.6% of the cases. Our final model suggests that the odds of sleeping in or very near an agricultural field were five times greater in cases than controls (p = 0.025). Survey data indicate that women, children, and men have similar propensities to both visit and sleep in or near agricultural fields. Conclusions Women and children may be underappreciated as CL risk groups in agriculturally dependent regions. Despite the age-sex breakdown of clinical CL patients and high rates of deforestation occurring in the study area, transmission is mostly occurring outside of the largest population centers. Curbing transmission in non-domestic spaces may be limited to decreasing exposure to sandflies during the evening, nighttime, and early morning hours. Our paper serves as a cautionary tale for those relying solely on the demographic information obtained from clinic-based data to understand basic epidemiological trends of vector-borne infections.

TI  - Lowland extirpation of anuran populations on a tropical mountain
T2  - PEERJ
AB  - Background. Climate change and infectious diseases threaten animal and plant species, even in natural and protected areas. To cope with these changes, species may acclimate, adapt, move or decline. Here, we test for shifts in anuran distributions in the Luquillo Mountains (LM), a tropical montane forest in Puerto Rico by comparing species distributions from historical (1931-1989)and current data (2015/2016).& para;& para;Methods. Historical data, which included different methodologies, were gathered through the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and published literature, and the current data were collected using acoustic recorders along three elevational transects.& para;& para;Results. In the recordings, we detected the 12 native frog species known to occur in LM. Over a span of similar to 25 years, two species have become extinct and four species suffered extirpation in lowland areas. As a consequence, low elevation areas in the LM (<300 m) have lost at least six anuran species.& para;& para;Discussion. We hypothesize that these extirpations are due to the effects of climate change and infectious diseases, which are restricting many species to higher elevations and a much smaller area. Land use change is not responsible for these changes because LM has been a protected reserve for the past 80 years. However, previous studies indicate that (1) climate change has increased temperatures in Puerto Rico, and (2) Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) was found in 10 native species and early detection of Bd coincides with anurans declines in the LM. Our study confirms the general impressions of amphibian population extirpations at low elevations, and corroborates the levels of threat assigned by IUCN.

TI  - Recording earthworm diversity on the tropical island of Martinique using DNA barcoding unveiled endemic species in bromeliad plants
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - In a context of accelerating biodiversity loss, some species may become extinct before taxonomists have time to collect and describe them. This is an even more critical problem for taxa with poor taxonomic knowledge, such as earthworms in the tropics. To overcome this taxonomic impediment, we investigated earthworm diversity on the tropical island of Martinique using DNA barcoding. Firstly, we sampled earthworms at 81 sites evenly distributed in two categories corresponding to natural and anthropized environments. We obtained a total of 684 sequences of a fragment of the COI gene. MOTU delimitation and morphological identification suggested that this dataset corresponded to 49 putative species, of which 16 were known exotic species. The rarefaction curve suggested that the sampling effort was not sufficient to capture total earthworm diversity in the natural environment and that many more species could be discovered. Secondly, we focused on a heterogeneous landscape around the town of Morne Rouge, where arboreal earthworms were sampled using a standardized protocol. We found 8 different species in epiphytic plants, three of which were found almost exclusively in bromeliad plants that were sampled above 1.4 m from the ground. The presence of these species, probably endemic to Martinique and new to science, was significantly correlated to the proportion of forest land cover. The most common earthworm in these habitats was Dichogaster andina, an exotic species found in bromeliads and Heliconia plants that were sampled at every height from the bottom of the tree up to 6.8 m. Its presence was correlated to the proportion of total river length in the landscape, suggesting that rivers may act as a dispersal vector. This study therefore highlights the great diversity of earthworms in Martinique, while emphasizing the main threats to this biodiversity, namely the alteration of habitats and the presence of invasive species.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variation of mosquito diversity (Diptera: Culicidae) at places with different land-use types within a neotropical montane cloud forest matrix
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
AB  - Background: Land-use change has led to a dramatic decrease in total forest cover, contributing to biodiversity loss and changes of ecosystems' functions. Insect communities of medical importance can be favored by anthropogenic alterations, increasing the risk of novel zoonotic diseases. The response of mosquito (Diptera: Culicidae) abundance and richness to five land-use types (shade coffee plantation, cattle field, urban forest, peri-urban forest, well-preserved montane cloud forest) and three seasons ("dry", "rainy" and "cold") embedded in a neotropical montane cloud forest landscape was evaluated.
   Methods: Standardized collections were performed using 8 CDC miniature black-light traps, baited with CO2 throughout the year. Generalized additive mixed models were used to describe the seasonal and spatial trends of both species richness and abundance. Rank abundance curves and ANCOVAs were used to detect changes in the spatial and temporal structure of the mosquito assemblage. Two cluster analyses were conducted, using 1-beta sim and the Morisita-Horn index to evaluate species composition shifts based on incidences and abundances.
   Results: A total of 2536 adult mosquitoes were collected, belonging to 9 genera and 10 species; the dominant species in the study were: Aedes quadrivittatus, Wyeomyia adelpha, Wy. arthrostigma, and Culex restuans. Highest richness was recorded in the dry season, whereas higher abundance was detected during the rainy season. The urban forest had the highest species richness (n = 7) when compared to all other sites. Species composition cluster analyses show that there is a high degree of similarity in species numbers across sites and seasons throughout the year. However, when considering the abundance of such species, the well-preserved montane cloud forest showed significantly higher abundance. Moreover, the urban forest is only 30 % similar to other sites in terms of species abundances, indicating a possible isolating role of the urban environment.
   Conclusion: Mosquito assemblage was differentially influenced by land-use change and seasonality, but at the same time the assemblage is rather homogeneous across the studied landscape, suggesting a high degree of spatial connectivity. Information generated in this study is potentially useful in the development of urban planning and surveillance programs focused mainly on mosquito species of medical and veterinary importance.

TI  - Multi-algorithm system for land cover classification in tropical dry forest at Guanacaste Conservation Area, Costa Rica
T2  - TECNOLOGIA EN MARCHA
AB  - For decades the detection and monitoring of land cover have been performed by aerial-transported remote sensing and satellites. Detecting and quantifying land cover relays on sensor capacities and classification techniques, such as supervised, unsupervised and mixed. The supervised method is the most accurate and depends on the ability of the algorithm used to discriminate the categories. On the land cover associated to the tropical dry forest at Guanacaste Conservation Area, Costa Rica, supervised classifications were used, using the Minimum Distance, Mahalanobies, Maximum Likelihood, Neural Network, Support Vector Machine and Parallelepiped algorithms to determine which algorithm classified the coverages better (late forest, early forest, intermediate forest, gallery forest, pasture, mangrove) according to control points taken through field work. According to the kappa index and precision values the performance of Maximum Likelihood and Neural Network was highlighted in the classification of land coverages. This study demonstrates that a hierarchical and multi-algorithm scheme can propel the results of the classification of land cover by considering the advantages and limitations of each classification algorithm, especially when considering aspects related to sample size, sensor resolutions (temporal, spatial, radiometric, spectral), atmospheric conditions and composition of vegetation and landscape.

TI  - Tropical pancreatitis
T2  - DIGESTIVE DISEASES
AB  - Tropical pancreatitis is a special type of chronic pancreatitis that is seen mainly in tropical countries. The prevalence of tropical pancreatitis is about 126/100,000 population in southern India. It occurs usually in young people, involves the main pancreatic duct and results in large ductal calculi. The etiology is not known, but genetic mutations such as the SPINK1 gene mutation and environmental factors are likely causes. Clinically, 1 90% of patients present with abdominal pain. About 25% of patients develop diabetes which generally requires insulin for its control but is ketosis-resistant. Painless diabetes is another clinical presentation in some patients. Most patients develop malnutrition during the course of the disease. Steatorrhea is less common. Patients with tropical pancreatitis may develop pancreatic cancer as a long-term complication. The diagnosis can be established by plain radiography of the abdomen, ultrasonography, computerized tomography scan of the abdomen or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Management is directed towards relief from pain and control of diabetes and steatorrhea. Pain relief can be obtained by analgesics and enzyme supplementation with preparations rich in proteases. Endotherapy coupled with stone fragmentation by extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy is an effective therapy for those who fail to respond to medical therapy. Surgical decompression of the main pancreatic duct by lateral pancreato-jejunostomy is reserved for patients with severe pain non-responsive to other forms of therapy. Copyright (C) 2004 S.

TI  - Forests and health: discourse and practises from the 18st to the 21st century
T2  - SANTE PUBLIQUE
AB  - The relations between forests and health carry ambivalent representations anchored in a long history. The dangers of deforestation and the usefulness of woodland to counter the "miasmas" and later the "pollution" are consistent with a Hippocratic approach that was reinterpreted at the end of the 18th century in the light of new knowledge in chemistry and biology. As of the 1970's, biodiversity was taken into consideration for the purposes of protecting and preserving forests seen as indispensable factors for public health. Conversely, the threats coming from tropical forests, that had been recognized for at least three centuries, and forest zoonoses that have been better identified all over the world in recent decades, are the negative side of this health-oriented representation of the role of forests. The analysis conducted in this article focuses on showing how these seemingly opposite views are actually complementary: once the mechanisms behind the diseases are better understood, the conservation of forests and their renewal become major goals for the populations concerned and for public authorities on the local, national and international scales, acting through numerous scientific studies and the establishment of public and private organisations. In this area, the role played by France is still too limited. A scrutiny of the last three centuries provides a better understanding of the essential character of social demands, cultural representations and medical expertise in the implementation of forest therapy and health-oriented environmental policies.

TI  - Evaluating remote sensing datasets and machine learning algorithms for mapping plantations and successional forests in Phnom Kulen National Park of Cambodia
T2  - PEERJ
AB  - This study develops a modelling framework by utilizing multi-sensor imagery for classifying different forest and land use types in the Phnom Kulen National Park (PKNP) in Cambodia. Three remote sensing datasets (Landsat optical data, ALOS L-band data and LiDAR derived Canopy Height Model (CHM)) were used in conjunction with three different machine learning (ML) regression techniques (Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests (RF) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)). These ML methods were implemented on (a) Landsat spectral data, (b) Landsat spectral band & ALOS backscatter data, and (c) Landsat spectral band, ALOS backscatter data, & LiDAR CHM data. The Landsat-ALOS combination produced more accurate classification results (95% overall accuracy with SVM) compared to Landsat-only bands for all ML models. Inclusion of LiDAR CHM (which is a proxy for vertical canopy heights) improved the overall accuracy to 98%. The research establishes that majority of PKNP is dominated by cashew plantations and the nearly intact forests are concentrated in the more inaccessible parts of the park. The findings demonstrate how different RS datasets can be used in conjunction with different ML models to map forests that had undergone varying levels of degradation and plantations.

TI  - Examining Landscape Factors Influencing Relative Distribution of Mosquito Genera and Frequency of Virus Infection
T2  - ECOHEALTH
AB  - Mosquito-borne infections cause some of the most debilitating human diseases, including yellow fever and malaria, yet we lack an understanding of how disease risk scales with human-driven habitat changes. We present an approach to study variation in mosquito distribution and concomitant viral infections on the landscape level. In a pilot study we analyzed mosquito distribution along a 10-km transect of a West African rainforest area, which included primary forest, secondary forest, plantations, and human settlements. Variation was observed in the abundance of Anopheles, Aedes, Culex, and Uranotaenia mosquitoes between the different habitat types. Screening of trapped mosquitoes from the different habitats led to the isolation of five uncharacterized viruses of the families Bunyaviridae, Coronaviridae, Flaviviridae, and Rhabdoviridae, as well as an unclassified virus. Polymerase chain reaction screening for these five viruses in individual mosquitoes indicated a trend toward infection with specific viruses in specific mosquito genera that differed by habitat. Based on these initial analyses, we believe that further work is indicated to investigate the impact of anthropogenic landscape changes on mosquito distribution and accompanying arbovirus infection.

TI  - Situated knowledge of pathogenic landscapes in Ghana: Understanding the emergence of Buruli ulcer through qualitative analysis
T2  - SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE
AB  - Successfully addressing neglected tropical diseases requires nuanced understandings of pathogenic landscapes that incorporate situated, contexualized community knowledge. In the case of Buruli ulcer (BU), the role of social science is vital to investigate complex human environment interactions and navigate different ways of knowing. We analyze a set of qualitative data from our interdisciplinary project on BU in Ghana, drawing from participatory mapping, focus group discussions, semi-structured interviews, and open-ended survey questions to explore how people in endemic and non-endemic areas see themselves embedded in changing environmental and social landscapes. We pay particular attention to landscape disturbance through logging and small-scale alluvial gold mining. The results from our participatory research underscore the holistic nature of BU emergence in landscapes, encapsulated in partial and incomplete local descriptions, the relevance of collective learning to distill complexity, and the potential of rich qualitative data to inform quantitative landscape-disease models.

TI  - Human land use and patterns of parasitism in tropical amphibian hosts
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Landscape alterations by humans can change patterns of parasite transmission. Depending on the type alteration and the life histories of parasites and hosts, parasitism may increase or decrease. To investigate whether parasitism in tropical amphibians was associated with land use change, I studied three species of amphibians, Rana vaillanti, Eleutherodactylus fitzingeri, and Smilisca puma from the Province of Heredia, Costa Rica, in the Atlantic lowlands. Frogs were collected and examined for parasites during the rainy seasons of 2001-2003 from sites in forest or clear-cut cattle pastures. The abundances of five species of parasites and parasite species richness of R. vaillanti were significantly higher in pasture habitat. A single parasite species shared by E. fitzingeri and S. puma showed a trend of increased abundance in pasture habitats. Overall, the abundances of six parasite species (three trematodes, an intestinal nematode, an encysted nematode, and a filarial nematode) were higher in pastures, while two species (trematodes) were higher in forest. This study suggests that land use activities in tropical regions affects the abundance and richness of amphibian parasites. Converting forest to pasture may impact the abundance of amphibian parasites because subsequent water quality changes (e.g. eutrophication, higher pH) often enhance habitat and resources for intermediate hosts (e.g. snails, mosquitoes) involved in parasite life cycles. Aquatic amphibians (e.g. R. vaillanti) may be particularly prone to experiencing increases in parasitism in agricultural habitats due to the positive relationship between many aquatic intermediate hosts and water quality changes associated with agricultural land use.

TI  - Comparison of Sampling Designs for Estimating Deforestation from Landsat TM and MODIS Imagery: A Case Study in Mato Grosso, Brazil
T2  - SCIENTIFIC WORLD JOURNAL
AB  - Sampling designs are commonly used to estimate deforestation over large areas, but comparisons between different sampling strategies are required. Using PRODES deforestation data as a reference, deforestation in the state of Mato Grosso in Brazil from 2005 to 2006 is evaluated using Landsat imagery and a nearly synchronous MODIS dataset. The MODIS-derived deforestation is used to assist in sampling and extrapolation. Three sampling designs are compared according to the estimated deforestation of the entire study area based on simple extrapolation and linear regression models. The results show that stratified sampling for strata construction and sample allocation using the MODIS-derived deforestation hotspots provided more precise estimations than simple random and systematic sampling. Moreover, the relationship between the MODIS-derived and TM-derived deforestation provides a precise estimate of the total deforestation area as well as the distribution of deforestation in each block.

TI  - Evaluation of classifiers for processing Hyperion (EO-1) data of tropical vegetation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
AB  - There is an urgent necessity to monitor changes in the natural surface features of earth. Compared to broadband multispectral data, hyperspectral data provides a better option with high spectral resolution. Classification of vegetation with the use of hyperspectral remote sensing generates a classical problem of high dimensional inputs. Complexity gets compounded as we move from airborne hyperspectral to Spaceborne technology. It is unclear how different classification algorithms will perform on a complex scene of tropical forests collected by spaceborne hyperspectral sensor. The present study was carried out to evaluate the performance of three different classifiers (Artificial Neural Network, Spectral Angle Mapper, Support Vector Machine) over highly diverse tropical forest vegetation utilizing hyperspectral (EO-1) data. Appropriate band selection was done by Stepwise Discriminant Analysis. The Stepwise Discriminant Analysis resulted in identifying 22 best bands to discriminate the eight identified tropical vegetation classes. Maximum numbers of bands came from SWIR region. ANN classifier gave highest OAA values of 81% with the help of 22 selected bands from SDA. The image classified with the help SVM showed OM of 71%, whereas the SAM showed the lowest OM of 66%. All the three classifiers were also tested to check their efficiency in classifying spectra coming from 165 processed bands. SVM showed highest OAA of 80%. Classified subset images coming from ANN (from 22 bands) and SVM (from 165 bands) are quite similar in showing the distribution of eight vegetation classes. Both the images appeared close to the actual distribution of vegetation seen in the study area. OM levels obtained in this study by ANN and SVM classifiers identify the suitability of these classifiers for tropical vegetation discrimination. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Ecological aspects of mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) in a fragment of seasonal dry tropical forest (Caatinga) in Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
AB  - Seasonally dry tropical forests are among the most vulnerable ecosystems to the effects of anthropogenic disturbances, and yet their biodiversity is still poorly known. In this study we investigated the composition, activity, structure, and effect of seasonality in mosquitoes' assemblages of a conservation Caatinga domain unit. The collections consisted of the monthly installation of two Shannon traps, set at a distance of 8 km between them, and operated by two captors, who collected simultaneously for 3 h (17:00h to 20:00h), totaling 288 h of sampling over two years. In total, 1261 specimens belonging to at least 20 sp. of the subfamilies Anophelinae and Culicinae were captured. Culicinae was the most representative subfamily, with 99.3% of all collected specimens, while for Anophelinae only nine specimens of the species Anopheles albitarsis Lynch Arribalzaga, 1878 s.l. were registered. Among the species of Culicinae, Aedes scapularis was the most abundant (39.9%), followed by Mansonia wilsoni (21.6%), Culex spp. (12.8%) and Aedes taeniorhynchus (12.4%). The Culicidae assemblage was more abundant and diverse in the wettest months and the twilight hours (17:00h to 18:00h). Our data indicate that Anopheles species are sensitive to Caatinga arid conditions and that mosquito populations are controlled by rainfall.

TI  - Ecological drivers of <i>Hepacivirus</i> infection in a neotropical rodent inhabiting landscapes with various degrees of human environmental change
T2  - OECOLOGIA
AB  - Anthropogenic environmental change can impact community and population traits such as species diversity and population densities, which have been shown to influence the prevalence of viruses in wildlife reservoirs. In particular, host species resilient to changes in their natural habitat may increase in numbers, which in turn can affect the prevalence of directly transmitted viruses. We have carried out a survey of small mammal communities in three tropical landscapes differing in their degree of environmental change in Central Panama and investigated the effects of community changes on Hepacivirus prevalence. The modification of continuous habitat into partly connected or isolated habitat patches during the past century was linked to changes in species diversity and species assemblages, which was further associated with shifts in the abundance of generalist marsupial (Didelphis marsupialis, Philander opossum) and rodent (Proechimys semispinosus) species. The latter has become dominant in isolated habitat patches and was the only identified Hepacivirus host in our study system. Our analyses suggest that, in addition to the effects of host age and sex, host population density in interaction with sex ratio is a crucial predictor of infection probability. Although we found no significant relationships between species diversity per se and infection probability, the lowest prevalence detected in the landscape with the highest species diversity indicates that shifts in species assemblages (e.g. changes in the presence and abundance of marsupial predators) impact the host's intraspecific contact rates, the probability of virus transmission and, thus, the virus prevalence. Our study additionally provides important data on the influence of human-induced landscape changes on infection probability and, therefore, on virus prevalence in wildlife and emphasizes the importance of a landscape-scale approach with concomitant consideration of the complex interactions between ecological factors.

TI  - Quantifying spatial-temporal changes of tea plantations in complex landscapes through integrative analyses of optical and microwave imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
AB  - High demand for tea has driven the expansion of tea plantations in the tropical and subtropical regions over the past few decades. Tea plant cultivation promotes economic development and creates job opportunities, but tea plantation expansion has significant impacts on biodiversity, carbon and water cycles, and ecosystem services. Mapping the spatial distribution and extent of tea plantations in a timely fashion is crucial for land use management and policy making. In this study, we mapped tea plantation expansion in Menghai County, Yunnan Province, China. We analyzed the structure and features of major land cover types in this tropical and subtropical region using (1) the HH and HV gamma-naught imagery from the Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS) Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) and (2) time series Landsat TM/ETM + /OLT imagery. Tea plantation maps for 2010 and 2015 were generated using the pixel-based support vector machine (SVM) approach at 30 m resolution, which had high user/producer accuracies of 83.58%/91.67% and 87.50%/90.83%, respectively. The resultant maps show that tea plantation area increased by 33.56% (similar to 9335 ha), from similar to 27,817 ha in 2010 to similar to 37,152 ha in 2015. The additional tea plantation area was mainly converted from forest (32.50%) and cropland (67.50%). The results showed that the combination of PALSAR and optical data performed better in tea plantation mapping than using optical data only. This study provides a promising new approach to identify and map tea plantations in complex tropical landscapes at high spatial resolution.

TI  - Environmental and spatial risk factors for the larval habitats of <i>Plasmodium knowlesi</i> vectors in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Land-use changes, such as deforestation and agriculture, can influence mosquito vector populations and malaria transmission. These land-use changes have been linked to increased incidence in human cases of the zoonotic malaria Plasmodium knowlesi in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. This study investigates whether these associations are partially driven by fine-scale land-use changes creating more favourable aquatic breeding habitats for P. knowlesi anopheline vectors. Using aerial remote sensing data, we developed a sampling frame representative of all land use types within a major focus of P. knowlesi transmission. From 2015 to 2016 monthly longitudinal surveys of larval habitats were collected in randomly selected areas stratified by land use type. Additional remote sensing data on environmental variables, land cover and landscape configuration were assembled for the study site. Risk factor analyses were performed over multiple spatial scales to determine associations between environmental and spatial variables and anopheline larval presence. Habitat fragmentation (300 m), aspect (350 m), distance to rubber plantations (100 m) and Culex larval presence were identified as risk factors for Anopheles breeding. Additionally, models were fit to determine the presence of potential larval habitats within the areas surveyed and used to generate a time-series of monthly predictive maps. These results indicate that land-use change and topography influence the suitability of larval habitats, and may partially explain the link between P. knowlesi incidence and deforestation. The predictive maps, and identification of the spatial scales at which risk factors are most influential may aid spatio-temporally targeted vector control interventions.

TI  - Effect of litter on the incidence of leaf-fungal pathogens and herbivory in seedlings of the tropical tree <i>Nectandra ambigens</i>
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY
AB  - Effects of litter cover on insect herbivory, leaf-fungal damage, and seedling performance (survival, growth in height and leaf number), were assessed on established Nectandra ambigens seedlings in three sites of a Mexican tropical rain forest. Naturally occurring seedlings were measured for height, leaf number and standing levels of leaf damage by herbivores and pathogens. Thereafter, seedlings were exposed for 1 y to three litter treatments: (1) litter addition, (2) control and (3) continuous litter removal. There was a significant effect of site on the proportion of surviving seedlings and on the relative growth rates in terms of leaf number. Overall, seedlings with higher initial leaf number showed higher survival and produced more leaves after 12 mo than seedlings with lower initial leaf number. Litter addition resulted in seedlings with lower relative growth rates in height and higher levels of damage by herbivores and pathogens. On average, leaf area damaged by pathogens was < 6% and herbivory was < 27%. Seedlings with higher levels of herbivory showed higher levels of pathogen attack. Herbivory and pathogen attack had no effect on seedling performance. This study reveals the importance of litter-cover on the interactions between seedlings, herbivores and pathogens, as well as on the performance of tropical seedlings.

TI  - Forest legislative changes and their impacts on mammal ecology and diversity in Brazil
T2  - BIOTA NEOTROPICA
AB  - Forest ecosystems within Brazil host one of the highest levels of mammalian diversity on Earth, much of which within legally required forest set-asides in private landholdings. The Legal Reserves (RLs) and Permanent Protected Areas (APPs) of the Brazilian Forest Code provide an important strategy to maintain this diversity. Yet a proposed amendment to Brazil's 1965 forestry code would reduce protection of Brazil's forests, including the Amazon and the Atlantic forest, and bring irreversible detrimental effects to mammal diversity. Mammals are key components of forest ecosystem, providing important environmental services as pollinators, seed dispersers and ecosystem engineers. The local extinction of some species will negatively affect forest ecosystem service provisioning throughout the country. Another important effect of forest conversion within private properties, should the proposed changes happen, will be the emergence of new diseases, bringing serious public health problems in Brazil.

TI  - Foraging choices of vampire bats in diverse landscapes: potential implications for land-use change and disease transmission
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - In Latin America, the common vampire bat Desmodus rotundus is the primary reservoir of rabies, a zoonotic virus that kills thousands of livestock annually and causes sporadic and lethal human rabies outbreaks. The proliferation of livestock provides an abundant food resource for this obligate blood-feeding species that could alter its foraging behaviour and rabies transmission, but poor understanding of the dietary plasticity of vampire bats limits understanding of how livestock influences rabies risk. We analysed individual- and population-level foraging behaviour by applying C-13 and N-15 stable isotope analysis to hair samples from 183 vampire bats captured from nine colonies in Peru. We also assessed the isotopic distributions of realized prey by analysing blood meals extracted from engorged bats and samples collected from potential prey species. In two adjacent but contrasting areas of the Amazon with scarce and abundant livestock, we used questionnaires to evaluate the incidence of feeding on humans. Population-level isotopic signatures suggested substantial among-site variation in feeding behaviour, including reliance on livestock in some colonies and feeding on combinations of domestic and wild prey in others. Isotopic heterogeneity within bat colonies was among the largest recorded in vertebrate populations, indicating that individuals consistently fed on distinct prey resources and across distinct trophic levels. In some sites, isotopic values of realized prey spanned broad ranges, suggesting that bats with intermediate isotopic values could plausibly be dietary specialists rather than generalists. Bayesian estimates of isotopic niche width varied up to ninefold among colonies and were maximized where wildlife and livestock were present at low levels, but declined with greater availability of livestock. In the Amazon, the absence of livestock was associated with feeding on humans and wildlife.Policy implications. We provide the first insights into the foraging behaviour of vampire bats in habitats with common depredation on humans and show how vampire bat foraging may respond to land-use change. Our results demonstrate risks of rabies transmission from bats to other wildlife and are consistent with the hypothesis that introducing livestock might reduce the burden of human rabies in high-risk communities.

TI  - Human encroachment into wildlife gut microbiomes
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY
AB  - In the Anthropocene, humans, domesticated animals, wildlife, and their environments are interconnected, especially as humans advance further into wildlife habitats. Wildlife gut microbiomes play a vital role in host health. Changes to wildlife gut microbiomes due to anthropogenic disturbances, such as habitat fragmentation, can disrupt natural gut microbiota homeostasis and make animals vulnerable to infections that may become zoonotic. However, it remains unclear whether the disruption to wildlife gut microbiomes is caused by habitat fragmentation per se or the combination of habitat fragmentation with additional anthropogenic disturbances, such as contact with humans, domesticated animals, invasive species, and their pathogens. Here, we show that habitat fragmentation per se does not impact the gut microbiome of a generalist rodent species native to Central America, Tome's spiny rat Proechimys semispinosus, but additional anthropogenic disturbances do. Indeed, compared to protected continuous and fragmented forest landscapes that are largely untouched by other human activities, the gut microbiomes of spiny rats inhabiting human-disturbed fragmented landscapes revealed a reduced alpha diversity and a shifted and more dispersed beta diversity. Their microbiomes contained more taxa associated with domesticated animals and their potential pathogens, suggesting a shift in potential metagenome functions. On the one hand, the compositional shift could indicate a degree of gut microbial adaption known as metagenomic plasticity. On the other hand, the greater variation in community structure and reduced alpha diversity may signal a decline in beneficial microbial functions and illustrate that gut adaption may not catch up with anthropogenic disturbances, even in a generalist species with large phenotypic plasticity, with potentially harmful consequences to both wildlife and human health. Fackelmann et al. study the gut microbial composition of spiny rats across tropical forests in Panama with varying levels of protection and fragmentation in order to disentangle the relative influences of habitat fragmentation and anthropogenic disturbance on wildlife gut microbiomes. They find that habitat fragmentation on its own did not affect the gut microbiome, but the microbiomes of individuals inhabiting forest fragments affected by anthropogenic disturbance displayed a shift in community composition and structure, and were more likely to have microbiota associated with domesticated animals and their pathogens.

T2  - Animal Biodiversity and Emerging Diseases: Prediction and Prevention
CP  - 9th Biennial Conference on Animal Biodiversity and Emerging Diseases - Prediction and Prevention
AB  - Hematological and plasma biochemical values of wild grasscutters were evaluated to determine their potential to transmit zoonotic pathogens. Three 5-ml, blood samples were collected from each of 1000 grasscutters caught in the wild for hematology, biochemical, and parasitological tests. Hematological and biochemical values were compared with those from captive-reared grasscutters. There are significantly (P < 0.05) higher lymphocyte, eosinophil, and basophil values for wild grasscutters compared to those that are captive reared. Parasitological examination revealed a 15% prevalence of blood protozoa in the wild grasscutters. Blood pathogens encountered were Trypanosoma sp. (66.7%) and Plasmodium sp. (33.3%), with 20.7% mixed infection. Sex does not significantly (P > 0.05) affect blood protozoa infection, while season does. We therefore concluded that wild grasscutters serve as efficient reservoir hosts for agents of African trypanosomiasis and malaria in the tropical humid rainforest region of Nigeria.

TI  - Effect of habitat fragmentation on the schistosome-transmitting snail <i>Oncomelania hupensis</i> in a mountainous area of China
T2  - TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - The effect of habitat fragmentation on schistosome-transmitting snails was assessed in an intervention village and a control village in Sichuan Province, China. Snail habitats were fragmented by environmental management. After 2 years, the proportions of quadrats with snails in the fragmented habitats decreased from 9.35% to 2.41% in one patch (c3) and from 12.20% to 6.57% in another patch (c12), whilst the proportions in habitats without fragmentation did not alter significantly. Mean snail density decreased from 0.246 to 0.063 snails/0.11 m(2) in patch c3 and from 0.356 to 0.177 snails/0.11 m2 in patch c12, whilst the mean snail density of other patches did not alter significantly. Most snails from the same patch and/or its remaining patches after fragmentation clustered together in the phylogenetic tree, except for cl, c3 and its remaining patches (c5, c6 and c11). Snail habitats in the study zone exhibited visible fragmentation. Habitat fragmentation could decrease the snail population size and limit migration and dispersal of snails between patches.

T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
AB  - ContextEnvironmental change impacts natural ecosystems and wildlife populations. In Australia, native forests have been heavily cleared and the local emergence of Hendra virus (HeV) has been linked to land-use change, winter habitat loss, and changing bat behavior.ObjectivesWe quantified changes in landscape factors for black flying foxes (Pteropus alecto), a reservoir host of HeV, in sub-tropical Queensland, Australia from 2000-2020. We hypothesized that native winter habitat loss and native remnant forest loss were greatest in areas with the most human population growth.MethodsWe measured the spatiotemporal change in human population size and native 'remnant' woody vegetation extent. We assessed changes in the observed P. alecto population and native winter habitats in bioregions where P. alecto are observed roosting in winter. We assessed changes in the amount of remnant vegetation across bioregions and within 50 km foraging buffers around roosts.ResultsHuman populations in these bioregions grew by 1.18 M people, mostly within 50 km foraging areas around roosts. Remnant forest extent decreased overall, but regrowth was observed when policy restricted vegetation clearing. Winter habitats were continuously lost across all spatial scales. Observed roost counts of P. alecto declined.ConclusionNative remnant forest loss and winter habitat loss were not directly linked to spatial human population growth. Rather, most remnant vegetation was cleared for indirect human use. We observed forest loss and regrowth in response to state land clearing policies. Expanded flying fox population surveys will help better understand how land-use change has impacted P. alecto distribution and Hendra virus spillover.

TI  - Linking Deforestation to Malaria in the Amazon: Characterization of the Breeding Habitat of the Principal Malaria Vector, <i>Anopheles darlingi</i>
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - This study examined the larval breeding habitat of a major South American malaria vector, Anopheles darlingi, in areas with varying degrees of ecologic alteration in the Peruvian Amazon. Water bodies were repeatedly sampled across 112 km of transects along the Iquitos-Nauta road in ecologically varied areas. Field data and satellite imagery were used to determine the landscape composition surrounding each site. Seventeen species of Anopheles larvae were collected. Anopheles darlingi larvae were present in 87 of 844 sites (10.3%). Sites with A. darlingi larvae had an average of 24.1% forest cover, compared with 41.0% for sites without A. darlingi (P < 0.0001). Multivariate analysis identified seasonality, algae, water body size, presence of human populations, and the amount of forest and secondary growth as significant determinants of A. darlingi presence. We conclude that deforestation and associated ecologic alterations are conducive to A. darlingi larval presence, and thereby increase malaria risk.

TI  - Discriminating Forest Successional Stages, Forest Degradation, and Land Use in Central Amazon Using ALOS/PALSAR-2 Full-Polarimetric Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - We discriminated different successional forest stages, forest degradation, and land use classes in the Tapajos National Forest (TNF), located in the Central Brazilian Amazon. We used full polarimetric images from ALOS/PALSAR-2 that have not yet been tested for land use and land cover (LULC) classification, neither for forest degradation classification in the TNF. Our specific objectives were: (1) to test the potential of ALOS/PALSAR-2 full polarimetric images to discriminate LULC classes and forest degradation; (2) to determine the optimum subset of attributes to be used in LULC classification and forest degradation studies; and (3) to evaluate the performance of Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) supervised classifications to discriminate LULC classes and forest degradation. PALSAR-2 images from 2015 and 2016 were processed to generate Radar Vegetation Index, Canopy Structure Index, Volume Scattering Index, Biomass Index, and Cloude-Pottier, van Zyl, Freeman-Durden, and Yamaguchi polarimetric decompositions. To determine the optimum subset, we used principal component analysis in order to select the best attributes to discriminate the LULC classes and forest degradation, which were classified by RF. Based on the variable importance score, we selected the four first attributes for 2015, alpha, anisotropy, volumetric scattering, and double-bounce, and for 2016, entropy, anisotropy, surface scattering, and biomass index, subsequently classified by SVM. Individual backscattering indexes and polarimetric decompositions were also considered in both RF and SVM classifiers. Yamaguchi decomposition performed by RF presented the best results, with an overall accuracy (OA) of 76.9% and 83.3%, and Kappa index of 0.70 and 0.80 for 2015 and 2016, respectively. The optimum subset classified by RF showed an OA of 75.4% and 79.9%, and Kappa index of 0.68 and 0.76 for 2015 and 2016, respectively. RF exhibited superior performance in relation to SVM in both years. Polarimetric attributes exhibited an adequate capability to discriminate forest degradation and classes of different ecological succession from the ones with less vegetation cover.

TI  - Howler monkeys are the reservoir of malarial parasites causing zoonotic infections in the Atlantic forest of Rio de Janeiro
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background A
   lthough malaria cases have substantially decreased in Southeast Brazil, a significant increase in the number of Plasmodium vivax-like autochthonous human cases has been reported in remote areas of the Atlantic Forest in the past few decades in Rio de Janeiro (RJ) state, including an outbreak during 2015-2016. The singular clinical and epidemiological aspects in several human cases, and collectively with molecular and genetic data, revealed that they were due to the non-human primate (NHP) parasite Plasmodium simium; however, the understanding of the autochthonous malarial epidemiology in Southeast Brazil can only be acquired by assessing the circulation of NHP Plasmodium in the foci and determining its hosts.
   Methodology
   A large sampling effort was carried out in the Atlantic forest of RJ and its bordering states (Minas Gerais, Sao Paulo, Espi ' rito Santo) for collecting and examining free-living NHPs. Blood and/or viscera were analyzed for Plasmodium infections via molecular and microscopic techniques.
   Principal findings
   In total, 146 NHPs of six species, from 30 counties in four states, were tested, of which majority were collected from RJ. Howler monkeys (Alouatta clamitans) were the only species found infected. In RJ, 26% of these monkeys tested positive, of which 17% were found to be infected with P. simium. Importantly, specific single nucleotide polymorphisms-the only available genetic markers that differentiate P. simium from P. vivax-were detected in all P. simium infected A. clamitans despite their geographical origin of malarial foci. Interestingly, 71% of P. simium infected NHPs were from the coastal slope of a mountain chain (Serra do Mar), where majority of the human cases were found. Plasmodium brasilianum/malariae was initially detected in 14% and 25% free-living howler monkeys in RJ and in the Espirito Santo (ES) state, respectively. Moreover, the malarial pigment was detected in the spleen fragments of 50% of a subsample comprising dead howler monkeys in both RJ and ES. All NHPs were negative for Plasmodium falciparum.
   Conclusions/Significance
   Our data indicate that howler monkeys act as the main reservoir for the Atlantic forest human malarial parasites in RJ and other sites in Southeast Brazil and reinforce its zoonotic characteristics.

T2  - BIOTA NEOTROPICA
AB  - Alongside modernity, the human activity has been a key factor in global environmental risks, with worldwide anthropic modification being the cause of the emergence of diseases for wild and livestock animals, and even humans. In special, the increase in the spatial distribution and in the incidence of some emerging infectious diseases (EID) are directly associated to deforestation and global climate changes. Moreover, the arise of new EID agents, such as the SARS-COV-2 have been reported for the last 30 years. On the other hand, biodiversity has been shown to be a key indicator for ecosystem health, and to pose a role to increase the promotion of human public health. In neotropical regions, and in special, in Brazil, several infectious diseases have been demonstrated to be directly affected for the biodiversity loss, such as malaria, hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, yellow fever, urban arboviruses, spotted fever, amongst other. To better understand the ecosystem capacity of regulation of infectious diseases, FAPESP BIOTA program have supported researchers and research projects to increase knowledge about Brazilian biodiversity and the ecosystems, such as diversity of bird bioagents, venomous animals biodiversity, diversity of mosquitos species in forest patches inside urban areas, propagation of the yellow fever virus over fragmented forest territories, loss of ecological corridors and occurrence of spotted fever and malaria, amongst others. It is noteworthy that FAPESP BIOTA is a successful program and must be expanded as an important tool for present and future public health promotion.

TI  - Global forest area disturbance from fire, insect pests, diseases and severe weather events
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Reliable global data on forest degradation and disturbances due to fire, insect pests, diseases and severe weather are important to understand ecosystem health and condition, safeguard production of goods and services and avoid negative impacts on human livelihoods. This paper presents a global analysis of forest area affected by fire, significant insect pest outbreaks, diseases and severe weather reported by countries as part of the Global Forest Resources Assessment 2015. Between 2003 and 2012, approximately 67 million hectares (1.7%) of forest land burned annually, mostly in tropical South America and Africa. In a similar reporting period, in total 142 million hectares of forest land were affected by other disturbances than fire. Insect pests affected more than 85 million hectares of forest, of which a major part was in temperate North America. Severe weather disturbed over 38 million hectares, mostly in Asia. About 12.5 million hectares were reported to be disturbed by diseases, mostly in Asia and Europe. There were strong correlations between burned forest area and the area of partial canopy cover reduction, as well as between burned forest area and net forest loss. Partial canopy cover reduction is used as a proxy for forest degradation, although it also includes land under management that is not degraded. A decreasing trend in burned forest area was found, largely accounted for by decreased area burned within the last ten years in tropical South America. However, an increasing trend in burned forest area was found in the boreal climatic domain. The data on other disturbances was not suitable for determining any year on year correlations and should be improved in future data collection exercises. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Effects of conservation management of landscapes and vertebrate communities on Lyme borreliosis risk in the United Kingdom
T2  - PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB  - Landscape change and altered host abundance are major drivers of zoonotic pathogen emergence. Conservation and biodiversity management of landscapes and vertebrate communities can have secondary effects on vector-borne pathogen transmission that are important to assess. Here we review the potential implications of these activities on the risk of Lyme borreliosis in the United Kingdom. Conservation management activities include woodland expansion, management and restoration, deer management, urban greening and the release and culling of non-native species. Available evidence suggests that increasing woodland extent, implementing biodiversity policies that encourage ecotonal habitat and urban greening can increase the risk of Lyme borreliosis by increasing suitable habitat for hosts and the tick vectors. However, this can depend on whether deer population management is carried out as part of these conservation activities. Exclusion fencing or culling deer to low densities can decrease tick abundance and Lyme borreliosis risk. As management actions often constitute large-scale perturbation experiments, these hold great potential to understand underlying drivers of tick and pathogen dynamics. We recommend integrating monitoring of ticks and the risk of tick-borne pathogens with conservation management activities. This would help fill knowledge gaps and the production of best practice guidelines to reduce risks.

TI  - Coprological survey of parasites of free-ranging jaguar (<i>Panthera onca</i>) and puma (<i>Puma concolor</i>) inhabiting 2 types of tropical forests in Mexico
T2  - REVISTA MEXICANA DE BIODIVERSIDAD
AB  - This study presents a coproparasitological survey of free-ranging jaguars (Panthera onca) and pumas (Puma concolor) inhabiting 2 types of tropical forest in southeastern Mexico. We examined 167 fecal samples (68 = jaguar; 33 = puma; 66 = unidentified large felids), and identified 16 parasitic taxa, 56% of which were nematodes. We compared parasite community composition and prevalence between host species and forest types, and found that parasitic communities of jaguar and puma were more similar between host species in the same forest type than among conspecific hosts inhabiting different forest types. Possible determinants for the observed patterns could include ecosystem differences and host evolutionary history, as well as disparate diet and habitat use of these 2 felines. Further studies are needed for a more accurate estimation of the parasitic community composition of these felines, and for a better comprehension of the effects that habitat perturbation could have on the ecology and transmission of parasitic diseases, and the related consequences for the conservation of wild felines.

TI  - Disturbance-driven variation in abundance-occupancy relationships over time in tropical forest fragments
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
AB  - A central problem in ecology is to understand spatial-temporal variation in abundance-occupancy relationship (AOR) and to identify the biological and anthropogenic drivers behind this variation. How AOR is influenced by ecological traits and anthropogenic disturbances is poorly understood. A data set of woody plants from eleven forest fragments around Kampala area, Uganda, recorded in 1990 and resampled in 2010 was used to analyse spatial variation in AORs at regional scales, variation between tree size classes and temporal change in these patterns. Slopes of the AORs for each forest were related to data on forest disturbances and effects of species traits on AOR at regional scales assessed. There were statistically significant positive interspecific AORs at regional scales. Over two decades, the strength of AOR and slopes increased at the regional scale. At local scale, slopes decreased, in correspondence with increasing disturbance. Species traits interacted with abundance to explain statistically significant variation in occupancy. Species successional status best explained occupancy variability. Incorporating species' traits and anthropogenic disturbance over time may lead to better understanding of the variation in interspecific AOR, and these results suggest that anthropogenic exploitation could be responsible for the changes in slope over time.

TI  - Influence of the landscape on dispersal of sylvatic triatomines to anthropic habitats in the Atlantic Forest
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY
AB  - Aim
   The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the dispersal of sylvatic triatomines to anthropic habitats is stimulated by degradation of their natural habitat.
   Location
   State of Espirito Santo, south-eastern Brazil.
   Methods
   We georeferenced records of domiciliary captures of sylvatic triatomines (1996-2005) obtained from the database of the entomological surveillance programme of the Brazilian National Health Foundation. We partitioned the study area into 543 equal hexagons and attributed information on the presence/absence of triatomines and climatic, topographic and biological variables to each. Using generalized additive models (GAMs), we defined the determinant variables for triatomine presence/absence and demarcated the potential areas in which they might occur. We then subjected the hexagons with a high probability of triatomine presence to a second analysis, adding information on the number of domiciliary captures of triatomines and landscape indices that measured quantitative and spatial patterns of forest fragments. We used GAMs to determine the indices that influenced the number of domiciliary captures of triatomines.
   Results
   The presence of triatomines was characterized by a strong positive correlation with variability of terrain slope. This variable was used to demarcate the areas where triatomines were likely to occur. Landscape indices associated with the number of domiciliary captures of triatomines were the number of patches, the fractal dimension index, the total core area and the clumpiness index.
   Main conclusions
   Our results do not support the hypothesis that domiciliary invasion by sylvatic triatomines is stimulated by environmental degradation. Instead, the results suggest that less degraded areas maintain larger populations of triatomines and consequently present higher indices of dispersal and domiciliary invasion. Particular landscape patterns and dispositions of human dwellings, however, may enhance the probability of triatomines being attracted to the artificial light of dwellings. Initiation of flight and consequent dispersal is a naturally occurring process that allows triatomines to find and colonize areas that favour the survival of their offspring.

TI  - The genetic dimension of pest pressure in the tropical rainforest
T2  - MOLECULAR ECOLOGY
AB  - Wet tropical forests are among the most diverse ecosystems on Earth and can host several hundreds of tree species per hectare. To maintain such diversity, the community must contain large numbers of relatively rare species rather than be dominated by a few very common trees, as is often the case in temperate forests. Explaining the mechanisms preventing dominance by common species has been a major task of tropical forest ecology. One of the most promising mechanisms is negative density dependence (NDD) of tree abundance driven by pests, including fungal diseases ('pest pressure'). NDD entails that the chance of survival of a sapling increases with the distance from a mature tree of the same species, thus preventing species from becoming locally dominant. Curiously, the strength of NDD is negatively correlated with abundance, meaning that tree species that are more common generally show weaker NDD (Comita et al. 2010). Interactions between plants and soil pathogens have been shown to play an important role in NDD (Klironomos 2002), and rare species are apparently more strongly affected (Mangan et al. 2010). However, the genetic mechanisms underlying this phenomenon have remained obscure. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Marden et al. (2017) suggest that reduced diversity of the genes involved in pathogen recognition (Resistance genes or R genes) could explain why NDD is stronger in locally rare species.

TI  - Characterization of Enzootic Foci of Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis Virus in Western Venezuela
T2  - VECTOR-BORNE AND ZOONOTIC DISEASES
AB  - The distribution of the sylvatic subtype ID Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) viruses in the lowland tropical forests of western Venezuela was investigated using remote sensing and geographic information system technologies. Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper satellite imagery was used to study the reflectance patterns of VEE endemic foci and to identify other locations with similar reflectance patterns. Enzootic VEE virus variants isolated during this study are the closest genetic relatives of the epizootic viruses that emerged in western Venezuela during 1992-1993. VEE virus surveillance was conducted by exposing sentinel hamsters to mosquito bites and trapping wild vertebrates in seven forests identified and located by means of the satellite image. We isolated VEE viruses from 48 of a total of 1,363 sentinel hamsters in two of the forests on six occasions, in both dry and wet seasons. None of the 12 small vertebrates captured in 8,190 trap-nights showed signs of previous VEE virus infection. The satellite image was classified into 13 validated classes of land use/vegetation using unsupervised and supervised techniques. Data derived from the image consisted of the raw digital values of near-and mid-infrared bands 4, 5, and 7, derived Tasseled Cap indices of wetness, greenness, and brightness, and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index. Digitized maps provided ancillary data of elevation and soil geomorphology. Image enhancement was applied using Principal Component Analysis. A digital layer of roads together with georeferenced images was used to locate the study sites. A cluster analysis using the above data revealed two main groups of dense forests separated by spectral properties, altitude, and soil geomorphology. Virus was isolated more frequently from the forest type identified on flat flood plains of main rivers rather than the forest type found on the rolling hills of the study area. The spatial analysis suggests that mosquitoes carrying the enzootic viruses would reach 82-97% of the total land area by flying only 1-3 km from forests. We hypothesize that humans within that area are at risk of severe disease caused by enzootic ID VEE viruses. By contrast, equines could actually become naturally vaccinated, thus preventing the local emergence of epizootic IC VEE virus strains and protecting humans indirectly.

TI  - Community-wide assessment of pollen limitation in hummingbird-pollinated plants of a tropical montane rain forest
T2  - ANNALS OF BOTANY
AB  - Although pollen limitation of reproduction (PL) has been widely studied, our understanding of its occurrence in tropical communities, especially for bird-pollinated plants, is underdeveloped. In addition, inclusion of both quantity and quality aspects in studies of PL are generally lacking. Within hummingbird-pollinated plants, a prediction was made for higher PL for the quality than quantity aspects and a minor effect of temporal variation because hummingbirds are constant and efficient pollen vectors but they may transfer low quality pollen.
   Field hand and open pollination experiments were conducted on 21 species in a tropical montane rain forest over 2 years. The quantity (fruit set and seeds per fruit) and quality (seed weight and germination) aspects of reproduction were assessed as the response to open pollination relative to outcross hand pollination. The relationships between the effect size of quantity and quality aspects of reproduction and predictive plant features (self-incompatibility, autogamy, density and pollinator specialization level) were assessed with phylogenetic generalized linear models.
   Just over half of all the species expressed PL for one or more response variables. On average, the severity of PL was strong for one quality variable (seed germination; 083), but insignificant for another (seed weight; 003), and low to moderate for quantity variables (031 for seeds per fruit and 039 for fruit set). There was only a minor contribution of temporal variation to PL within the studied species. Common predictors of PL, i.e. phylogenetic relatedness, self-incompatibility, autogamy, plant density and pollinator specialization level, did not adequately explain variation in PL within this community.
   Despite the measurable degree of PL within these hummingbird-pollinated plants, the causes of pollen quality and quantity insufficiency are not clear. Variables other than those tested may contribute to PL or causes of PL may vary among species and cannot adequately be accounted for when assessed from the within-community perspective.

TI  - Profiling Humoral Immune Response Against Pre-Erythrocytic and Erythrocytic Antigens of Malaria Parasites Among Neotropical Primates in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest
T2  - FRONTIERS IN CELLULAR AND INFECTION MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Human malaria due to zoonotic transmission has been recorded in the Atlantic Forest, an extra-Amazonian area in Brazil, which are a challenge for malaria control. Naturally acquired humoral immune response against pre-erythrocytic and erythrocytic antigens of Neotropical primates (NP) was evaluated here to improve the knowledge about the exposure of those animals to the malaria transmission and support the identification of the potential reservoirs of the disease in the Atlantic Forest. Blood samples of 154 monkeys from three areas of the Atlantic Forest were used to identify IgG antibodies against peptides of the repeat region of the major pre-erythrocytic antigen, the circumsporozoite protein (CSP), of Plasmodium vivax (PvCSP), Plasmodium brasilianum/Plasmodium malariae (Pb/PmCSP), and Plasmodium falciparum (PfCSP) by ELISA. Antibodies against erythrocytic recombinant antigens of P. vivax, Apical membrane antigen 1 (PvAMA-1), Erythrocyte binding protein 2 (PvEBP-2) and domain II of Duffy binding protein (PvDBPII) were also evaluated. Parameters, such as age, sex, PCR positivity, and captivity, potentially associated with humoral immune response were analyzed. Eighty-five percent of NP had antibodies against at least one CSP peptide, and 76% against at least one P. vivax erythrocytic antigen. A high percentage of adults compared to non-adults were seropositive and showed increased antibody levels. Neotropical primates with PCR positive for P. simium had a significantly higher frequency of positivity rate for immune response against PvEBP-2, PvDBPII and also higher antibody levels against PvDBPII, compared to PCR negative NPs for this species. Monkeys with PCR positive for P. brasilianum/P. malariae showed higher frequency of seropositivity and antibody levels against Pb/PmCSP. Levels of antibodies against Pb/PmCSP, PvEBP-2 and PvDBPII were higher in free-living than in captive monkeys from the same area. All Platyrrhine families showed antibodies against CSP peptides, however not all showed IgG against erythrocytic antigens. These findings showed a high prevalence of naturally acquired antibodies against CSP repeats in all studied areas, suggesting an intense exposure to infected-mosquitoes bites of NP from all families. However, mainly monkeys of Atelidae family showed antibodies against P. vivax erythrocytic antigens, suggesting blood infection, which might serve as potential reservoirs of malaria in the Atlantic Forest.

TI  - FILOVIRUS ACTIVITY AMONG SELECTED ETHNIC-GROUPS INHABITING THE TROPICAL FOREST OF EQUATORIAL AFRICA
T2  - TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Seroepidemiological surveys were conducted to determine the frequency and distribution of filovirus activity among selected ethnic groups inhabiting the tropical forests of the Central African Republic. 427 serum specimens were collected from hunter-gatherers and subsistence farmers living in forest environs in the Lobaye District south of the river Lobaye and west of the river Oubangui. Striking serological evidence for filovirus activity was found in both populations. Ebola virus appears to be the most active filovirus; 17.6% (75/427) of the Lobaye survey population were seropositive for Ebola virus reactive antibody while 1.2% (5/427) were seroreactive with Marburg viral antigens. Ethnic background appeared to be an important risk factor influencing filovirus exposure in the forest communities. The filovirus antibody prevalence among 21-40 years old male Aka Pygmy hunter-gatherers was significantly (P=0.03) 3 times higher (37.5%) than that in similarly aged male Monzombo and Mbati subsistence farmers (13.2%). Continued epidemiological investigations are needed to define ethnic-related events influencing human filovirus activity in the Congo basin of equatorial Africa.

TI  - Tracking Cloud Forests With Cloud Technology and Random Forests
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
AB  - Hotspots of endemic biodiversity, tropical cloud forests teem with ecosystem services such as drinking water, food, building materials, and carbon sequestration. Unfortunately, already threatened by climate change, the cloud forests in our study area are being further endangered during the Covid pandemic. These forests in northern Ecuador are being razed by city dwellers building country homes to escape the Covid virus, as well as by illegal miners desperate for money. Between August 2019 and July 2021, our study area of 52 square kilometers lost 1.17% of its tree cover. We base this estimate on simulations from the predictive model we built using Artificial Intelligence, satellite images, and cloud technology. When simulating tree cover, this model achieved an accuracy between 96 and 100 percent. To train the model, we developed a visual and interactive application to rapidly annotate satellite image pixels with land use and land cover classes. We codified our algorithms in an R package-loRax-that researchers, environmental organizations, and governmental agencies can readily deploy to monitor forest loss all over the world.

TI  - The Organization for Tropical Studies: History, accomplishments, future directions in education and research, with an emphasis in the contributions to the study of plant reproductive ecology and genetics in tropical ecosystems
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - The Organization for Tropical Studies (OTS) has played a pivotal role in our understanding of tropical ecosystems' structure and function. For more than fifty years, OTS has contributed to the training of three generations of tropical biologists and facilitated, supported, and promoted leading-edge research in its field stations. Plant reproductive ecology and genetics have been a significant focus of OTS research since the early 1960s, and Dr. K. S. Bawa made a significant contribution to the advancement of this field. His work improved our understanding of the diversity and evolution of breeding systems in tropical forests, their phenology and pollination ecology, and their mating and genetic structure. We argue that his work inspired other tropical biologists' work and used the work of one of the authors for illustration when appropriate. We point out the need for research in critically important topics to slow down biodiversity loss, prevent the collapse of tropical systems in a changing climate, and the emergence of zoonotic disease. We suggest future research topics for the OTS field stations, including in plant reproductive biology.

TI  - A Machine-Learning Approach to PolInSAR and LiDAR Data Fusion for Improved Tropical Forest Canopy Height Estimation Using NASA AfriSAR Campaign Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
AB  - This paper investigates the benefits of integrating multibaseline polarimetric interferometric SAR (PolInSAR) data with LiDAR measurements using a machine-learning approach in order to obtain improved forest canopy height estimates. Multiple interferometric baselines are required to ensure consistent height retrieval performance across a broad range of tree heights. Previous studies have proposed multibaseline merging strategies using metrics extracted from PolInSAR measurements. Here, we introduce the multibaseline merging using a support vector machine trained by sparse LiDAR samples. The novelty of this method lies in the new way of combining the two datasets. Its advantage is that it does not require a complete LiDAR coverage, but only sparse LiDAR samples distributed over the PolInSAR image. LiDAR samples are not used to obtain the best height among a set of height stacks, but rather to train the retrieval algorithm in selecting the best height using the variables derived through PolInSAR processing. This enables more accurate height estimation for a wider scene covered by the SAR with only partial LiDAR coverage. We test our approach on NASA AfriSAR data acquired over tropical forests by the L-band UAVSAR and the LVIS LiDAR instruments. The estimated height from this approach has a higher accuracy (r(2) = 0.81, RMSE = 7.1 m) than previously introduced multibaseline merging approach (r(2) = 0.67, RMSE = 9.2 m). This method is beneficial to future spaceborne missions, such as GEDI and BIOMASS, which will provide a wealth of near-contemporaneous LiDAR samples and PolInSAR measurements for mapping forest structure at global scale.

TI  - Multispecies entanglements in the virosphere: Rethinking the Anthropocene in light of the 2019 coronavirus outbreak
T2  - ANTHROPOCENE REVIEW
AB  - In this essay, we reevaluate the 2019 outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) from the perspective of multispecies entanglements. It is argued that anthropogenic alterations in the biosphere will most likely accelerate the rate of multispecies pandemics in the Anthropocene. Using a textual analysis approach of anthropological and historical sources on the example of coronaviruses and live animal markets in China, we trace how the virosphere of wild animals from tropical regions comes into contact with the virosphere of humans and farmed animals in highly industrialized landscapes. We suggest that adopting a multispecies perspective on viruses can allow them to be understood as living processes that interact with other species in a realm called the virosphere. The rate at which novel infectious diseases are transmitted by bacteria and viruses has increased in recent decades. We argue that this is caused by side effects of the Anthropocene, such as deforestation, the surge in population growth and density, and anthropogenic climate change, which give rise to an increased number of unusual encounters between humans, nonhuman companion species, and wild animals. In this way, the virospheres of host organisms, which were formerly partly isolated, are allowed to converge and freely exchange infectious diseases, leading to a more homogenized virosphere. As anthropogenic alterations are set to continue in the future, we suggest that multispecies pandemics will likely increase in the following decades.

TI  - Primates facing climate crisis in a tropical forest hotspot will lose climatic suitable geographical range
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Global climate changes affect biodiversity and cause species distribution shifts, contractions, and expansions. Climate change and disease are emerging threats to primates, and approximately one-quarter of primates' ranges have temperatures over historical ones. How will climate changes influence Atlantic Forest primate ranges? We used habitat suitability models and measured potential changes in area and distributions shifts. Climate change expected in 2100 may change the distribution area of Atlantic Forest primates. Fourteen species (74%) are predicted to lose more than 50% of their distribution, and nine species (47%) are predicted to lose more than 75% of their distribution. The balance was negative, indicating a potential future loss, and the strength of the reduction in the distribution is related to the severity of climate change (SSP scenarios). Directional shifts were detected to the south. The projected mean centroid latitudinal shift is similar to 51 km to the south for 2100 SSP5-8.5 scenario. The possibility of dispersal will depend on suitable routes and landscape configuration. Greenhouse gas emissions should be urgently reduced. Our results also emphasize that no more forest loss is acceptable in Atlantic Forest, and restoration, canopy bridges, friendly agroecosystems, and monitoring of infrastructure projects are urgent to enable dealing with climate change.

TI  - Drivers of lowland rain forest community assembly, species diversity and forest structure on islands in the tropical South Pacific
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
AB  - P>1. Testing the comparative strength and influence of age and area of islands, proximity of source propagules and disturbances on community assembly, species diversity and vegetation structure has proved difficult at large scales. The little-studied rain forests in the Tropical South Pacific (TSP) provide a unique study area to investigate determinants of community dynamics, with islands varying in age, isolation, area and cyclone frequency. We tested the effects of biogeographical factors and cyclone frequency on the species composition, species diversity and forest structure of old-growth rain forest using 1-ha inventory plots on 12 islands between New Guinea and the Solomon Islands.
   2. As predicted by the General Dynamic Model of Oceanic Island Biogeography, the biogeographical variables of archipelago age and island area are the most important factors affecting species richness and diversity, with older and larger islands having higher richness and diversity. There is no significant effect of cyclone frequency on species diversity.
   3. The theory that diversity drives endemism is not supported in this system as endemism is not correlated with species diversity. Instead, age and isolation of an island best explain patterns of endemism, with the latter suggesting dispersal limitations between archipelagos.
   4. Proximity to source area influences species composition of lowland tropical rain forests in the TSP, which is also supported by a strong correlation between geographic distance and floristic similarity. Vector-fitting onto non-metric multidimensional scaling suggests that archipelago age and cyclone frequency may, in addition to proximity to source area, influence species composition. This implies that a species' tolerance to cyclones affects its abundance at different cyclone frequencies.
   5. Synthesis. Both biogeographical variables (island area and isolation) and cyclone frequency appear to affect community assembly in lowland rain forests in the TSP. While species are hence not ecologically equivalent, interspecific ecological differences do not seem to affect the overall patterns of species diversity, which are mostly determined by biogeographical variables, as predicted by the neutral theory.

TI  - Patterns of land use, crop and forest cover change in the Ashanti region, Ghana
T2  - JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY
AB  - This paper examines the factors which have interacted to alter patterns of land use, crop preference and forest cover between the pre-colonial and post-colonial periods, using the multi-case study and political ecology approach in the Ashanti region, Ghana. The paper observed that changes in land use, crop preference and change in the structure of forest cover are driven by four major factors: a) economic conditions, b) state incentives, c) natural and agro-ecological conditions, d) social factors. The results point out that cocoa was the main source of livelihood for farming households in the region until the 1980s when several farmers switched to oil palm because of its perceived ecologic viability and higher economic returns. The conversion greatly altered the landscape of the region. While highlighting the difficulties posed by uncontrolled land use, crop and forest cover changes, the study concludes that interventions such as promoting sustainable agricultural practices, drought and disease-resistant crop varieties with shorter gestation periods, and environment-friendly off-farm and off-season economic activities are significant in managing and addressing the challenges that result in loss of forest cover.

TI  - Environmental factors associated with disease incidence in plant species from a Mexican seasonal tropical dry forest
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE TORREY BOTANICAL SOCIETY
AB  - Occurrence of plant pathogens and levels of disease are modified by variations in the abiotic and biotic environment. However, there is little information on the effects of environmental changes at a local scale on incidence and severity of foliar disease in seasonal tropical natural systems. We studied the occurrence of leaf fungal diseases in four tree species from a Mexican seasonal tropical dry forest over 2 yr and explored its relation with abiotic factors. Necrotic leaf spots affected all plant species. The probability of disease incidence tended to be higher in the year 2008 than in 2007, and varied among surveyed sites. Mean proportion of leaf area damaged per plant varied among sites. In all the cases where the relationship was significant, the probability of disease incidence and leaf area damaged per plant were negatively affected by canopy openness and mean maximum temperature. Only in Achatocarpus gracilis was the probability of disease incidence positively affected by relative humidity in both years, and the leaf area damaged per plant was only positively affected by this variable in 2007. Our study contributes to the understanding of the role of abiotic factors in the occurrence and severity of diseases in seasonal tropical dry forests.

TI  - Prevalence of <i>Plasmodium</i> parasites in non-human primates and mosquitoes in areas with different degrees of fragmentation in Colombia
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
AB  - Background Parasites from the genus Plasmodium, the aetiological agent of malaria in humans, can also infect non-human primates (NHP), increasing the potential risk of zoonotic transmission with its associated global public health concerns. In Colombia, there are no recent studies on Plasmodium spp. infecting free-ranging NHP. Thus, this study aimed to determine the diversity of Plasmodium species circulating in fragmented forests in central Colombia, both in Anopheles mosquitoes and in the four sympatric NHP in the region (Ateles hybridus, Cebus versicolor, Alouatta seniculus and Aotus griseimembra), in order to evaluate the risk of infection to humans associated with the presence of sylvatic hosts and vectors infected with Plasmodium spp. Methods Overall, there were collected 166 fecal samples and 25 blood samples from NHP, and 442 individuals of Anopheles spp. DNA extraction, nested PCR using mitochondrial (cox3 gene) and ribosomal (18S rDNA) primers, electrophoresis and sequencing were conducted in order to identify Plasmodium spp. from the samples. Results Plasmodium falciparum was detected in two fecal samples of Alouatta seniculus, while Plasmodium vivax/simium infected Ateles hybridus, Cebus versicolor and Alouatta seniculus. Co-infections with P. vivax/simium and Plasmodium malariae/brasilianum were found in three individuals. The highest prevalence from blood samples was found for Plasmodium malariae/brasilianum in two Alouatta seniculus while Plasmodium vivax/simium was most prevalent in fecal samples, infecting four individuals of Alouatta seniculus. Seven Anopheles species were identified in the study site: Anopheles (Anopheles) punctimacula, Anopheles (An.) malefactor, Anopheles (Nyssorhynchus) oswaldoi, Anopheles (Nys.) triannulatus, Anopheles (An.) neomaculipalpus, Anopheles (Nys.) braziliensis and Anopheles (Nys.) nuneztovari. Infection with P. vivax/simium was found in An. nuneztovari, An. neomaculipalpus, and An. triannulatus. Furthermore, An. oswaldoi and An. triannulatus were found infected with P. malariae/brasilianum. The effect of fragmentation and distance to the nearest town measured in five forests with different degrees of fragmentation was not statistically significant on the prevalence of Plasmodium in NHP, but forest fragmentation did have an effect on the Minimum Infection Rate (MIR) in Anopheles mosquitoes. Conclusions The presence of Plasmodium spp. in NHP and Anopheles spp. in fragmented forests in Colombia has important epidemiological implications in the human-NHP interface and the associated risk of malaria transmission.

TI  - Tropical forest canopy height estimation from combined polarimetric SAR and LiDAR using machine-learning
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Forest height is an important forest biophysical parameter which is used to derive important information about forest ecosystems, such as forest above ground biomass. In this paper, the potential of combining Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) variables with LiDAR measurements for forest height estimation is investigated. This will be conducted using different machine learning algorithms including Random Forest (RFs), Rotation Forest (RoFs), Canonical Correlation Forest (CCFs) and Support Vector Machine (SVMs). Various PolSAR parameters are required as input variables to ensure a successful height retrieval across different forest heights ranges. The algorithms are trained with 5000 LiDAR samples (less than 1% of the full scene) and different polarimetric variables. To examine the dependency of the algorithm on input training samples, three different subsets are identified which each includes different features: subset 1 is quiet diverse and includes non-vegetated region, short/sparse vegetation (0-20 m), vegetation with mid-range height (20-40 m) to tall/dense ones (40-60 m); subset 2 covers mostly the dense vegetated area with height ranges 40-60 m; and subset 3 mostly covers the non-vegetated to short/sparse vegetation (0-20 m) .The trained algorithms were used to estimate the height for the areas outside the identified subset. The results were validated with independent samples of LiDAR-derived height showing high accuracy (with the average R-2 = 0.70 and RMSE = 10 m between all the algorithms and different training samples). The results confirm that it is possible to estimate forest canopy height using Po1SAR parameters together with a small coverage of LiDAR height as training data.

TI  - Biting rhythms and infection rates of anthropophilic sand fly species (Diptera: Phlebotominae) in sites with different land use in southern Mexico
T2  - ACTA TROPICA
AB  - Could tropical forest conversion shape sand fly (Diptera: Phlebotominae) biting rhythms and Leishmania infection rates? Using a Shannon trap, we estimated the bite rate and infection prevalence among anthropophilic sand flies at sites with different land use in southern Mexico. We estimated the expected monthly infection rate of the Leishmania parasite along the gradient and generated information on the biting rhythm of sand flies in a poorly characterized cutaneous leishmaniasis endemic region. We used generalized mixed linear and mixed additives models to evaluate differences in the biting rate, nocturnal activity, and inoculation rate of female sand flies, as well as their relationship with the loss of forest cover and environmental disparities recorded throughout the study area. Our results show that the loss of forest cover influences the biting rhythm of sand fly species and the potential number of infectious bites with Leishmania, but the greatest entomological and potential epidemiological risk continues to be associated with sylvatic areas (amplification events). Despite this, we detected that the effect of forest cover (%) on the entomological exposure seems to be also dependent on the sand fly species, and that, albeit to a lesser extent, Leishmania parasite is circulating in disturbed landscapes through generalist and competent sand fly vector species. We also found that land use change did not affect the nocturnal activity, however we detected that important vector species were active most of the time. Contrary to our expectation, temperature and humidity did not shape the biting rhythm of sand fly species. We discuss the limitations and epidemiological implications of our findings regarding the risk of contracting leishmaniasis in southern Mexico.

TI  - A New Approach Based on TensorFlow Deep Neural Networks with ADAM Optimizer and GIS for Spatial Prediction of Forest Fire Danger in Tropical Areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Frequent forest fires are causing severe harm to the natural environment, such as decreasing air quality and threatening different species; therefore, developing accurate prediction models for forest fire danger is vital to mitigate these impacts. This research proposes and evaluates a new modeling approach based on TensorFlow deep neural networks (TFDeepNN) and geographic information systems (GIS) for forest fire danger modeling. Herein, TFDeepNN was used to create a forest fire danger model, whereas the adaptive moment estimation (ADAM) optimization algorithm was used to optimize the model, and GIS with Python programming was used to process, classify, and code the input and output. The modeling focused on the tropical forests of the Phu Yen Province (Vietnam), which incorporates 306 historical forest fire locations from 2019 to 2023 and ten forest-fire-driving factors. Random forests (RF), support vector machines (SVM), and logistic regression (LR) were used as a baseline for the model comparison. Different statistical metrics, such as F-score, accuracy, and area under the ROC curve (AUC), were employed to evaluate the models' predictive performance. According to the results, the TFDeepNN model (with F-score of 0.806, accuracy of 79.3%, and AUC of 0.873) exhibits high predictive performance and surpasses the performance of the three baseline models: RF, SVM, and LR; therefore, TFDeepNN represents a novel tool for spatially predicting forest fire danger. The forest fire danger map from this study can be helpful for policymakers and authorities in Phu Yen Province, aiding sustainable land-use planning and management.

TI  - Tree species effects on pathogen-suppressive capacities of soil bacteria across two tropical dry forests in Costa Rica
T2  - OECOLOGIA
AB  - Antibiotic-producing bacteria in the genus Streptomyces can inhibit soil-borne plant pathogens, and have the potential to mediate the impacts of disease on plant communities. Little is known about how antibiotic production varies among soil communities in tropical forests, despite a long history of interest in the role of soil-borne pathogens in these ecosystems. Our objective was to determine how tree species and soils influence variation in antibiotic-mediated pathogen suppression among Streptomyces communities in two tropical dry forest sites (Santa Rosa and Palo Verde). We targeted tree species that co-occur in both sites and used a culture-based functional assay to quantify pathogen-suppressive capacities of Streptomyces communities beneath 50 focal trees. We also measured host-associated litter and soil element concentrations as potential mechanisms by which trees may influence soil microbes. Pathogen-suppressive capacities of Streptomyces communities varied within and among tree species, and inhibitory phenotypes were significantly related to soil and litter element concentrations. Average proportions of inhibitory Streptomyces in soils from the same tree species varied between 1.6 and 3.3-fold between sites. Densities and proportions of pathogen-suppressive bacteria were always higher in Santa Rosa than Palo Verde. Our results suggest that spatial heterogeneity in the potential for antibiotic-mediated disease suppression is shaped by tree species, site, and soil characteristics, which could have significant implications for understanding plant community composition and diversity in tropical dry forests.

TI  - Arthropods vectors of diseases. What is the risk for travellers of being bitten? Of being contaminated?
T2  - BULLETIN DE LA SOCIETE DE PATHOLOGIE EXOTIQUE
AB  - Many bloodsucking arthropods are potential vectors of disease. To become a vector, the arthropod must be susceptible to the infective agent and must survive the incubation period so as to transmit the pathogens to a host. While some arthropod associated diseases affect only man (e.g. malaria) most of these diseases are (anthropo-) zoonoses with man often an accidental host The risk of contamination depends on the one hand on the biting behaviour of the vector; its biology and distribution, and on the other hand on the sites visited by the traveller, the length of his stay, his activities, the conditions of sleeping accommodation. The risk of contracting malaria is very high in tropical Africa, in me forest area of South America and South East Asia, in Papua New Guinea. Malaria can be prevented ii measures (e.g. pyrethroid impregnated bed nets, repellents) are taken to avoid bites of Anopheline mosquitoes between sunset and sunrise, but appropriate chemoprophylaxis must not be neglected. Lethal cases of yellow fever among unvaccinated travellers still occur despite a strict international regulation on vaccination requirements. Dengue is a major health problem in intertropical areas. As no vaccine is available, personal protection measures are recommended against daytime-biting mosquitoes, including the use of protective clothing, repellents. Other arthropod borne diseases among travellers are less common but the risks increase during adventure trips (e.g, zoonotic leishmaniasis, tick-borne relapsing fever) and humanitarian actions (e.g. risk of louse-borne typhus during visits of overcrowded prisons).
   Tick-borne diseases receive nowadays more attention. These diseases are not only restricted to some occupations (farmers, veterinarians) but also ramblers and campers are at risk. Attached licks should be removed rapidly and carefully, since several hours of attachment are needed for transmission of spirochetes of LYME disease.

TI  - High-resolution planet satellite imagery and multi-temporal surveys to predict risk of tree mortality in tropical eucalypt forestry
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - Global high-resolution imagery is a well-assimilated technology in forest mapping. The release of the Norway's International Climate & Forests Initiative (NICFI) Planet tropical basemaps time-series starting in 2015 at a 4.77m resolution represents a unique opportunity to forecast climate change consequences such as drought episodes. Using multi-temporal ground surveys over 144 plots and publicly available high-resolution Planet dove time series imagery we evaluate forest mortality patterns driven by imaging spectroscopy methods in Mato Grosso (Brazil) over an area planted with eucalypts severely affected by the 2019 drought. Changes in vegetation indexes before and after the 2019 drought were modelled using the effective logistic regression modelling to explain variation in tree mortality between the surveys, the dependent variable. We aimed to straightforwardly model tree mortality using change vectors in Planet's image mosaics co-registering in time with the observed tree mortality measurements in the field. The results showed differences in Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as the most significant predictor variable under the effective logistic regression modelling performed. The efficacy of 80.98% in concordance pairs correctly classified represented 0.81 of area under the Receiver Operating Curve (ROC). The release of the 2015-2020 Planet imagery in the tropics at 4.77-m resolution represents a valuable dataset to better understand previous natural disturbances and a powerful technology to detect in advance, and monthly after September 2020, eucalypt areas prone to harmful and increasingly frequent water stress episodes.

TI  - Hantavirus antibodies among phyllostomid bats from the arc of deforestation in Southern Amazonia, Brazil
T2  - TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES
AB  - In order to determine whether southern Amazonian bats could harbour hantaviruses we, serologically and molecularly, screened blood, saliva, excreta and organ tissues of 47 bats captured from September to December 2015. We found that only phyllostomid bats presented antibodies against hantavirus. The seropositive bats belonged to two species of Phyllostomid bats: the greater spear-nosed bat Phyllostomus hastatus (omnivorous) and the gnome fruit-eating bat Dermanura gnoma. The overall seroprevalence was of 4.2%. Therefore, we show here that hantaviruses are circulating among phyllostomid bats in the Amazonian arc of deforestation.

TI  - Forest foods and healthy diets: quantifying the contributions
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Forested landscapes provide a source of micronutrient rich food for millions of people around the world. A growing evidence base suggests these foods may be of great importance to the dietary quality of people living in close proximity to forests - especially in communities with poor access to markets. Despite widespread evidence of the consumption of forest foods around the world, to date, few studies have attempted to quantify the nutritional contributions these foods make. In this study we tested the hypothesis that the consumption of forest foods can make important contributions to dietary quality. We investigated the dietary contributions of wild forest foods in smallholder dominated forested landscapes from 37 sites in 24 tropical countries, using data from the Poverty and Environment Network (PEN). We compared quantities of forest foods consumed by households with dietary recommendations and national average consumption patterns. In addition, we compared the relative importance of forests and smallholder agriculture in supplying fruits, vegetables, meat and fish for household consumption. More than half of the households in our sample collected forest foods for their own consumption, though consumption patterns were skewed towards low-quantity users. For high-quantity consuming households, however, forest foods made a substantial contributions to their diets. The top quartile of forest food users in each site obtained 14.8% of the recommended amounts of fruits and vegetables, and 106% of the reference quantity of meat and fish from forests. In 13 sites, the proportion of meat and fish coming from forests was greater than from domestic livestock and aquaculture, while in 11 sites, households procured a greater proportion of fruits and vegetables from forests than from agriculture. Given high levels of heterogeneity in forest food consumption, we identify four forest food use site typologies to characterize the different use patterns: 'forest food dependent', 'limited forest food use', 'forest food supplementation' and 'specialist forest food consumer' sites. Our results suggest that while forest foods do not universally contribute significantly to diets, in some sites where large quantities of forest foods are consumed, their contribution towards dietary adequacy is substantial.

TI  - Antifungal potential of Lauraceae rhizobacteria from a tropical montane cloud forest against Fusarium spp.
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - The occurrence of pests and diseases can affect plant health and productivity in ecosystems that are already at risk, such as tropical montane cloud forests. The use of naturally occurring microorganisms is a promising alternative to mitigate forest tree fungal pathogens. The objectives of this study were to isolate rhizobacteria associated with five Lauraceae species from a Mexican tropical montane cloud forest and to evaluate their antifungal activity against Fusarium solani and F. oxysporum. Fifty-six rhizobacterial isolates were assessed for mycelial growth inhibition of Fusarium spp. through dual culture assays. Thirty-three isolates significantly reduced the growth of F. solani, while 21 isolates inhibited that of F. oxysporum. The nine bacterial isolates that inhibited fungal growth by more than 20% were identified through 16S rDNA gene sequence analysis; they belonged to the genera Streptomyces, Arthrobacter, Pseudomonas, and Staphylococcus. The volatile organic compounds (VOC) produced by these nine isolates were evaluated for antifungal activity. Six isolates (Streptomyces sp., Arthrobacter sp., Pseudomonas sp., and Staphylococcus spp.) successfully inhibited F. solani mycelial growth by up to 37% through VOC emission, while only the isolate INECOL-21 (Pseudomonas sp.) inhibited F. oxysporum. This work provides information on the microbiota of Mexican Lauraceae and is one of the few studies identifying forest tree-associated microbes with inhibitory activity against tree pathogens.

TI  - European Cloth and "Tropical" Skin: Clothing Material and British Ideas of Health and Hygiene in Tropical Climates
T2  - BULLETIN OF THE HISTORY OF MEDICINE
AB  - As Britain's imperial and colonial ambitions intensified toward the end of the nineteenth century, the preservation of white European health in tropical climates became an increasingly important concern. Since at least the seventeenth century, the "tropics" had been seen as spaces holding vast potential wealth but also death and disease. To combat these deadly but desirable landscapes, the British built a considerable commodity Culture around the preservation of white European health, and for many, tropical clothing was one of the most important and essential items in their "kits." This article investigates the composition and use of such clothing in relation to British ideas of health and hygiene in tropical climates. First, it considers debates that ensued over the best material-wool, cotton, linen, silk, or a combination of these materials-and the role of "black" skin and local practice in the development of tropical clothing. Second, it demonstrates the importance of location in any discussion of tropical medicine and hygiene, and the tension and ambiguity that still surrounded British ideas of health and hygiene in the tropical colonies. Third, it argues that tropical clothing was important in the maintenance of climatic etiologies despite advances in parasitology and sanitary science. Finally, it considers the relationship of tropical clothing to the formation of a unique colonial identity. To British men and women embarking for any number of tropical destinations, proper clothing was not a banal and mundane component of their outfitting. For many, the clothing signified a departure from the safe and "civil" climes of Britain for adventure in the expanding tropical empire.

TI  - 'Zoonoses? Not sure what that is...' An assessment of knowledge of zoonoses among medical students in India
T2  - TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - This study focuses on estimating knowledge of zoonoses among medical students and recent graduates, with an aim of understanding critical gaps in medical education with respect to zoonoses. A semi-structured tool for knowledge assessment, having nine principal domains of knowledge and five domains of practice, was developed and validated. Using this tool, cross-sectional data was collected from 364 medical students and recent graduates and knowledge scores were calculated based on pre-defined guidelines.
   Out of the 364 respondents, only 10 defined zoonoses accurately (2.8%). Only 33.7% of the respondents in the public college (62 out of 184) and 3.3% in the private college (6 out of 180) could correctly name three common parasitic zoonoses in India. Only 5.5% of respondents (20 out of 361) were able to identify rabies as a disease transmitted by animals other than dogs. Knowledge on all emerging and new infectious diseases was poor. The average knowledge score was 64% in the public medical college and 41.4% in the private medical college. These poor scores imply that, on average, a student knows only 40-60% of what is needed to diagnose, treat and report zoonotic diseases effectively. Considering the changing landscape of infectious diseases, the current medical curriculum needs to be revised to improve understanding of existing zoonoses and also include emerging diseases.

TI  - MADERA: A standardized Pan-Amazonian dataset for tropical timber species
T2  - ECOLOGY
AB  - We compiled and presented a dataset for all timber species reported in the Amazon region from all nine South American Amazonian countries. This was based on official information from every country, as well as from two substantial scientific references. We verified the standard taxonomic names from each individual source, using the Taxonomic Name Resolution Service (TNRS) and considered all Amazonian tree species with diameter at breast height (DBH) & GE;10 cm. We also obtained estimates of the current population size for most species from a published approach based on data from 1900 tree inventory plots (1-ha each) distributed across the Amazon region and part from the Amazon Tree Diversity Network (ATDN). We then identified the hyperdominant timber species. In addition, we overlapped our timber species list with data for species that are used for commercial purposes, according to the International Tropical Timber Organization (ITTO), the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) taxa assessment and Red List categories. Finally, we also included IUCN Red List categories based on combined deforestation, and climate change scenarios for these species. Our final Amazonian timber species dataset contains 1112 unique species records, which belong to 337 genera and 72 families from the lowland Amazonian rainforest, with associated information related to population, conservation, and trade status of each species. The authors of this research expect that the information provided will be useful to strengthen the public forestry policies of the Amazon countries, inform ecological studies, as well for forest management purposes.

TI  - Operational Tree Species Mapping in a Diverse Tropical Forest with Airborne Imaging Spectroscopy
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Remote identification and mapping of canopy tree species can contribute valuable information towards our understanding of ecosystem biodiversity and function over large spatial scales. However, the extreme challenges posed by highly diverse, closed-canopy tropical forests have prevented automated remote species mapping of non-flowering tree crowns in these ecosystems. We set out to identify individuals of three focal canopy tree species amongst a diverse background of tree and liana species on Barro Colorado Island, Panama, using airborne imaging spectroscopy data. First, we compared two leading singleclass classification methods-binary support vector machine (SVM) and biased SVM-for their performance in identifying pixels of a single focal species. From this comparison we determined that biased SVM was more precise and created a multi-species classification model by combining the three biased SVM models. This model was applied to the imagery to identify pixels belonging to the three focal species and the prediction results were then processed to create a map of focal species crown objects. Crown-level cross-validation of the training data indicated that the multi-species classification model had pixel-level producer's accuracies of 94-97% for the three focal species, and field validation of the predicted crown objects indicated that these had user's accuracies of 94-100%. Our results demonstrate the ability of high spatial and spectral resolution remote sensing to accurately detect non-flowering crowns of focal species within a diverse tropical forest. We attribute the success of our model to recent classification and mapping techniques adapted to species detection in diverse closed-canopy forests, which can pave the way for remote species mapping in a wider variety of ecosystems.

TI  - Characterising residual malaria transmission in forested areas with low coverage of core vector control in central Viet Nam
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
AB  - Background: Despite great success in significantly reducing the malaria burden in Viet Nam over recent years, the ongoing presence of malaria vectors and Plasmodium infection in remote forest areas and among marginalised groups presents a challenge to reaching elimination and a threat to re-emergence of transmission. Often transmission persists in a population despite high reported coverage of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs), the mainstay control method for malaria. To investigate what factors may contribute to this, a mixed-methods study was conducted in Son Thai commune, a community in south-central Viet Nam that has ongoing malaria cases despite universal LLIN coverage. A cross-sectional behavioural and net-coverage survey was conducted along with observations of net use and entomological collections in the village, farm huts and forest sites used by members of the community.
   Results: Most community members owned a farm hut plot and 71.9% of adults aged 18+ years sometimes slept overnight in the farm hut, while one-third slept overnight in the forest. Ownership and use of nets in the village households was high but in the farm huts and forest was much lower; only 44.4% reported regularly using a bednet in the farm and 12.1% in the forest. No primary anopheline species were captured in the village, but Anopheles dirus (s.l.) (n = 271) and An. maculatus (s.l.) (n = 14) were captured as far as 4.5 km away in farm huts and forest. A high proportion of biting was conducted in the early evening before people were under nets. Entomological inoculation rates (EIR) of An. dirus (s.l.) were 17.8 and 25.3 infectious bites per person per year in the outdoor farm hut sites and forest, respectively, for Plasmodium falciparum and 25.3 in the forest sites for P. vivax.
   Conclusions: Despite high net coverage in the village, gaps in coverage and access appear in the farm huts and forest where risk of anopheline biting and parasite transmission is much greater. Since subsistence farming and forest activities are integral to these communities, new personal protection methods need to be explored for use in these areas that can ideally engage with the community, be durable, portable and require minimal behavioural change.

TI  - Neotropical <i>Anopheles</i> (<i>Kerteszia</i>) mosquitoes associated with bromeliad-malaria transmission in a changing world
T2  - ACTA TROPICA
AB  - Kerteszia is a neotropical subgenus of Anopheles composed of 12 species. The species in this subgenus are strongly associated with humid forests rich in epiphytic bromeliads. Forest fragmentation and anthropogenic changes can therefore have a negative impact on the abundance and survival of these mosquito species. Within this subgenus, four species are considered primary vectors of malaria: An. cruzii, An. bellator, An. homunculus and An. neivai. Malaria cases associated with Kerteszia species are often referred to as bromeliad malaria, a type of malaria reported to be endemic in the coastal rainforest of the neotropical region since the end of the nineteenth century. Although the incidence of bromeliad-malaria cases has decreased since the middle of the last century, autochthonous malaria cases continue to be registered every year. The complexity of the epidemiology of bromeliad malaria appears to be increasing as asymptomatic plasmodial infections and transmission of simian Plasmodium to humans have recently been reported. Kerteszia vector species have a great affinity for human beings and can be found in human-modified areas close to forest fragments such as in the Extra-Amazonian region of Brazil, Colombian pacific coast, and the Caribbean coast. Deforestation and forest fragmentation have been occurring continuously in the biomes of the neotropical region, and findings of Kerteszia species in dwellings are frequent in this region. Controlling the species in the Kerteszia subgenus is particularly difficult because they move frequently from natural to rural and peri-urban areas in search of blood sources, posing a challenge for the development of control strategies based on integrated vector management. Furthermore, as it has been shown that some Kerteszia species share similar morphological and genetic characteristics, the existence of a species complex formed by cryptic, sibling species within the Kerteszia group in different areas in the South and Southeast of Brazil cannot be ruled out. The existence of such a complex could represent an obstacle to the control of Kerteszia species and consequently to the elimination of bromeliad-malaria transmission in these regions. Here, we review publications that focus on the biology and ecology of Kerteszia malaria vectors and their association with human-modified areas and bromeliad-malaria transmission.

TI  - Drivers of <i>Echinococcus multilocularis</i> Transmission in China: Small Mammal Diversity, Landscape or Climate?
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background: Human alveolar echinococcocosis (AE) is a highly pathogenic zoonotic disease caused by the larval stage of the cestode E. multilocularis. Its life-cycle includes more than 40 species of small mammal intermediate hosts. Therefore, host biodiversity losses could be expected to alter transmission. Climate may also have possible impacts on E. multilocularis egg survival. We examined the distribution of human AE across two spatial scales, (i) for continental China and (ii) over the eastern edge of the Tibetan plateau. We tested the hypotheses that human disease distribution can be explained by either the biodiversity of small mammal intermediate host species, or by environmental factors such as climate or landscape characteristics.
   Methodology/findings: The distributions of 274 small mammal species were mapped to 967 point locations on a grid covering continental China. Land cover, elevation, monthly rainfall and temperature were mapped using remotely sensed imagery and compared to the distribution of human AE disease at continental scale and over the eastern Tibetan plateau. Infection status of 17,589 people screened by abdominal ultrasound in 2002-2008 in 94 villages of Tibetan areas of western Sichuan and Qinghai provinces was analyzed using generalized additive mixed models and related to epidemiological and environmental covariates. We found that human AE was not directly correlated with small mammal reservoir host species richness, but rather was spatially correlated with landscape features and climate which could confirm and predict human disease hotspots over a 200,000 km(2) region.
   Conclusions/Significance: E. multilocularis transmission and resultant human disease risk was better predicted from landscape features that could support increases of small mammal host species prone to population outbreaks, rather than host species richness. We anticipate that our study may be a starting point for further research wherein landscape management could be used to predict human disease risk and for controlling this zoonotic helminthic.

TI  - <i>Francisella</i> spp. detected in <i>Dermacentor</i> ticks in Malaysian forest reserve areas
T2  - VETERINARY PARASITOLOGY- REGIONAL STUDIES AND REPORTS
AB  - Limited information is available on tropical ticks and tick-borne bacteria affecting the health of humans and animals in the Southeast Asia region. Francisella tularensis is a tick-borne bacterium which causes a potentially life-threatening disease known as tularemia. This study was conducted to determine the occurrence of Francisella spp. in questing ticks collected from Malaysian forest reserve areas. A total of 106 ticks (mainly Dermacentor and Haemaphysalis spp.) were examined for Francisella DNA using a Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay targeting the bacterial 16S rDNA. Francisella DNA was detected from 12 Dermacentor ticks. Sequence analysis of the amplified 16S rDNA sequences (1035 bp) show > 99% identity with that of Francisella endosymbiont reported in a tick from Thailand. A dendrogram constructed based on the bacterial 16S rDNA shows that the Francisella spp. were distantly related to the pathogenic strains of F. tularensis. Three Francisella-positive ticks were identified as Dermacentor atrosignatus, based on sequence analysis of the tick mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene. Further screening of cattle and sheep ticks (Haemaphysalis bispinosa and Rhipicephalus microplus) and animal samples (cattle, sheep, and goats) did not yield any positive findings. Our findings provide the first molecular data on the occurrence of a Francisella strain with unknown pathogenicity in Dermacentor questing ticks in Malaysia.

TI  - Epidemiology, Biodiversity, and Technological Trajectories in the Brazilian Amazon: From Malaria to COVID-19
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - The Amazon biome is under severe threat due to increasing deforestation rates and loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services while sustaining a high burden of neglected tropical diseases. Approximately two thirds of this biome are located within Brazilian territory. There, socio-economic and environmental landscape transformations are linked to the regional agrarian economy dynamics, which has developed into six techno-productive trajectories (TTs). These TTs are the product of the historical interaction between Peasant and Farmer and Rancher practices, technologies and rationalities. This article investigates the distribution of the dominant Brazilian Amazon TTs and their association with environmental degradation and vulnerability to neglected tropical diseases. The goal is to provide a framework for the joint debate of the local economic, environmental and health dimensions. We calculated the dominant TT for each municipality in 2017. Peasant trajectories (TT1, TT2, and TT3) are dominant in ca. fifty percent of the Amazon territory, mostly concentrated in areas covered by continuous forest where malaria is an important morbidity and mortality cause. Cattle raising trajectories are associated with higher deforestation rates. Meanwhile, Farmer and Rancher economies are becoming dominant trajectories, comprising large scale cattle and grain production. These trajectories are associated with rapid biodiversity loss and a high prevalence of neglected tropical diseases, such as leishmaniasis, Aedes-borne diseases and Chagas disease. Overall, these results defy simplistic views that the dominant development trajectory for the Amazon will optimize economic, health and environmental indicators. This approach lays the groundwork for a more integrated narrative consistent with the economic history of the Brazilian Amazon.

TI  - Aboveground biomass in secondary montane forests in Peru: Slow carbon recovery in agroforestry legacies
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - Andean tropical montane forests (TMF) are hotspots of biodiversity that provide fundamental hydrological services as well as carbon sequestration and storage. Agroforestry systems occupy large areas in the Andes but climatic pressures, market volatility and diseases may result inagroforest abandonment, promoting secondary succession. Secondary forests are well-adapted and efficient carbon sinks whose conservation is vital to mitigate and adapt to climate change and to support biodiversity. Little is known, however, about how secondary TMF recover their aboveground biomass (AGB) and composition after abandonment. We established a 1.5 ha plot at 1780 masl on a 30-year old abandoned agroforest and compared it against two control forest plots at similar elevations. Agroforestry legacies influenced AGB leading to far lower stocks (42.3 +/- 5.4-59.6 +/- 7.9 Mg ha(-1) using allometric equations) than those expected after 30 years (106 +/- 33 Mg ha(-1)) based on IPCC standard growth rates for secondary montane forests. This suggests a regional overestimation of mitigation potentials when using IPCC standards. Satellite-derived AGB largely overestimated our plot values (179 +/- 27.3 Mg ha(-1)). Secondary growth rates (1.41-2.0 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) for DBH >= 10 cm) indicate recovery times of ca. 69 to 97 years to reach average control AGB values (137 +/- 12.3 Mg ha(-1)). This is 26 years above the average residence time of montane forests at our elevation (71 +/- 1.91 years) suggesting a non-recovery or far slower recovery to control AGB values. Three variables appear to define this outcome compared to the control plots: lower DBH (15.8 +/- 5.9 cm vs 19.8 +/- 11.0 cm), lower basal area (12.67 +/- 0.7 vs 28.03 +/- 1.5 m(2) ha(-1)) and higher abundance of lighter-wood tree genera (0.46 +/- 0.10 vs 0.57 +/- 0.11 gr cm(3)) such as Inga, a common shade-tree in Andean agroforests. With 3.2 million hectares committed to restoration, Peru needs to target currently neglected TMF recovery schemes to support biodiversity, water and carbon storage and fulfill its international commitments.

TI  - Spatial and temporal patterns of gap dominance by low-canopy lianas detected using EO-1 Hyperion and Landsat Thematic Mapper
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Woody lianas are critical to tropical forest dynamics because of their strong influence on forest regeneration, disturbance ecology, and biodiversity. Recent studies synthesizing plot data from the tropics indicate that lianas are increasing in both abundance and importance in tropical forests. Moreover, lianas exhibit competitive advantages over trees in elevated CO2 environments and under strong seasonal droughts, suggesting that lianas may be poised to increase not only in abundance but also in spatial distribution in response to changing climate. We used a combination of high-resolution color-infrared videography and hyperspectral imagery from EO-1 Hyperion to map low-lying lianas in Noel Kempff Mercado National Park (NKMNP) in the Bolivian Amazon. Evergreen liana forests comprise as much as 14% of the NKMNP landscape, and low-stature liana patches occupy 1.5% of these forests. We used change vector analysis (CVA) of dry season Landsat TM and ETM+ imagery from 1986 and 2000 to determine changes in liana-dominated patches over time and to assess whether those patches were regenerating to canopy forest. The spatial distribution of liana patches showed that patches were spatially aggregated and were preferentially located in proximity to waterways. The CVA results showed that most of the dense liana patches increased in brightness and greenness and decreased in wetness over the 14 years of the change analysis, while non-liana forest patches changed less and in more random directions. Persistent liana patches increased in area by an average of 59% over the time period. In comparison, large burned areas appeared to recover completely to canopy forest in the same time period. This suggests that the dense liana patches of NKMNP represent an alternative successional pathway characterized not by tree regeneration but rather by a stalled state of low-canopy liana dominance. This research supports hypotheses that liana forests can be a persistent rather than transitional component of tropical forests, and may remain so due to competitive advantages that lianas enjoy under changing climatic conditions.

TI  - Host-generalist fungal pathogens of seedlings may maintain forest diversity via host-specific impacts and differential susceptibility among tree species
T2  - NEW PHYTOLOGIST
AB  - Host-specialized pathogens are credited with the maintenance of tropical forest diversity under the Janzen-Connell hypothesis. Yet, in diverse forests, selection may favor pathogens with broad host ranges, given their passive dispersal and the relative rarity of tree species.
   We surveyed the host associations of potential pathogens isolated from symptomatic seedlings in forests in Panama and used inoculations to assess the pathogenicity and host ranges of 27 fungal isolates, and differences among tree species in susceptibility.
   Thirty-one of the 33 nonsingleton operational taxonomic units (OTUs) isolated from seedlings are multi-host. All 31 multi-host OTUs exhibit low to moderate specialization, and we observed phylogenetically overdispersed host use for 19 OTUs. The pathogenicity of 10 isolates was experimentally confirmed; nine caused disease in seedlings in multiple families. However, the outcome of infection differs among tree species susceptible to a given multi-host pathogen. Furthermore, some tree species were seemingly resistant to all fungi tested, while others were susceptible to multiple fungi. Tree species adapted to environments with lower disease pressure were most likely to exhibit disease.
   Our results suggest that generalist pathogens contribute to the maintenance of local and regional forest diversity via host-specific impacts and the exclusion of disease-sensitive trees from disease-prone habitats.

TI  - Plant pathogens drive density-dependent seedling mortality in a tropical tree
T2  - ECOLOGY LETTERS
AB  - One explanation for the extraordinary diversity of tropical forest trees is that density-dependent mortality from herbivores or pathogens puts locally rare species at an advantage. Density-dependent mortality of seeds and small seedlings is particularly intense in tropical forests, but its causes remain uncertain. Here, we show experimentally that pathogens from the Oomycota are associated with intense mortality in seedlings of a neotropical tree, Sebastiana longicuspis. Seedlings in untreated plots experienced eight times higher mortality compared with seedlings in plots treated with fungicide. Mortality was strongly density dependent: in fungicide-treated plots survival was unaffected by density, but survival in unsprayed plots was over three times higher at low density. Density-dependent mortality observed in a simultaneous, non-manipulative study was highly transient, suggesting that short-term observational studies may underestimate the intensity and form of pathogen-induced mortality. If such effects are widespread, plant pathogens may play a key role in maintaining and structuring tropical diversity.

TI  - ForestGapR: An r Package for forest gap analysis from canopy height models
T2  - METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB  - In forest ecosystems, many functional processes are governed by local canopy gap dynamics, caused by either natural or anthropogenic factors. Quantifying the size and spatial distribution of canopy gaps enables an improved understanding and predictive modelling of multiple environmental phenomena. For instance knowledge of canopy gap dynamics can help us elucidate time-integrated effects of tree mortality, regrowth and succession rates, carbon flux patterns, species heterogeneity and three-dimensional spacing within structurally complex forest ecosystems. Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) has emerged as a technology that is well-suited for mapping forest canopy gaps in a wide variety of forest ecosystems and across spatial scales. New technological and algorithmic advances, including ALS remote-sensing, coupled with optimized frameworks for data processing and detection of forest canopy gaps, are allowing an enhanced understanding of forest structure and functional processes. This paper introduces ForestGapR, a cutting-edge open source r package for forest gap analysis from canopy height models derived from ALS and other remote sensing sources. The ForestGapR package offers tools to (a) automate forest canopy gap detection, (b) compute a series of gap statistics, including gap-size frequency distributions and spatial distribution, (c) map gap dynamics (when multitemporal ALS data are available) and (d) convert forest canopy gaps detected into raster or vector layers as per user requirements. As case studies, we run ForestGapR on ALS data collected over four different tropical forest regions worldwide. We hope this new package will enable further research towards understanding the distribution, dynamics and role of canopy gaps not only in tropical forests, but in other forest types elsewhere.

TI  - Modeling Disease Vector Occurrence when Detection Is Imperfect: Infestation of Amazonian Palm Trees by Triatomine Bugs at Three Spatial Scales
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background: Failure to detect a disease agent or vector where it actually occurs constitutes a serious drawback in epidemiology. In the pervasive situation where no sampling technique is perfect, the explicit analytical treatment of detection failure becomes a key step in the estimation of epidemiological parameters. We illustrate this approach with a study of Attalea palm tree infestation by Rhodnius spp. (Triatominae), the most important vectors of Chagas disease (CD) in northern South America.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: The probability of detecting triatomines in infested palms is estimated by repeatedly sampling each palm. This knowledge is used to derive an unbiased estimate of the biologically relevant probability of palm infestation. We combine maximum-likelihood analysis and information-theoretic model selection to test the relationships between environmental covariates and infestation of 298 Amazonian palm trees over three spatial scales: region within Amazonia, landscape, and individual palm. Palm infestation estimates are high (40-60%) across regions, and well above the observed infestation rate (24%). Detection probability is higher (similar to 0.55 on average) in the richest-soil region than elsewhere (similar to 0.08). Infestation estimates are similar in forest and rural areas, but lower in urban landscapes. Finally, individual palm covariates (accumulated organic matter and stem height) explain most of infestation rate variation.
   Conclusions/Significance: Individual palm attributes appear as key drivers of infestation, suggesting that CD surveillance must incorporate local-scale knowledge and that peridomestic palm tree management might help lower transmission risk. Vector populations are probably denser in rich-soil sub-regions, where CD prevalence tends to be higher; this suggests a target for research on broad-scale risk mapping. Landscape-scale effects indicate that palm triatomine populations can endure deforestation in rural areas, but become rarer in heavily disturbed urban settings. Our methodological approach has wide application in infectious disease research; by improving eco-epidemiological parameter estimation, it can also significantly strengthen vector surveillance-control strategies.

TI  - Influenza Activity and Province-level Weather Variations in Thailand, 2009 to 2014, Using Random Forest Time-series Approach
T2  - CHIANG MAI JOURNAL OF SCIENCE
AB  - Influenza activity in Thailand, like many tropical regions, is a burden on public health and economy. The goal of this study is to find links between influenza activity and weather variations of the province-level in Thailand. We use a Random Forest time-series model to analyze the data and evaluate the importance of each variable. Data from 2009 to 2013, in weekly units, is used as a training set to create prediction models. Data from 2014 is used as a test set to validate prediction models. Five high populated provinces are selected to represent different geological regions in Thailand for this study. Although, results indicate that the number of influenza cases from the previous week yields the highest importance for influenza activity, weather variations are not without their impacts. Influenza activity in different provinces is associated with different sets of weather variations and their importance. In all selected provinces, the change in temperatures plays a significant role in influenza activity but its impacts are location-dependent. Correlation coefficients between predicted and observed influenza cases in 2014 are from 055 to 0.91.

TI  - Mapping Risk of Nipah Virus Transmission from Bats to Humans in Thailand
T2  - ECOHEALTH
AB  - Nipah virus (NiV) is a zoonotic virus that can pose a serious threat to human and livestock health. Old-world fruit bats (Pteropus spp.) are the natural reservoir hosts for NiV, and Pteropus lylei, Lyle's flying fox, is an important host of NiV in mainland Southeast Asia. NiV can be transmitted from bats to humans directly via bat-contaminated foods (i.e., date palm sap or fruit) or indirectly via livestock or other intermediate animal hosts. Here we construct risk maps for NiV spillover and transmission by combining ecological niche models for the P. lylei bat reservoir with other spatial data related to direct or indirect NiV transmission (livestock density, foodborne sources including fruit production, and human population). We predict the current and future (2050 and 2070) distribution of P. lylei across Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam. Our best-fit model predicted that central and western regions of Thailand and small areas in Cambodia are currently the most suitable habitats for P. lylei. However, due to climate change, the species range is predicted to expand to include lower northern, northeastern, eastern, and upper southern Thailand and almost all of Cambodia and lower southern Vietnam. This expansion will create additional risk areas for human infection from P. lylei in Thailand. Our combined predictive risk maps showed that central Thailand, inhabited by 2.3 million people, is considered highly suitable for the zoonotic transmission of NiV from P. lylei. These current and future NiV transmission risk maps can be used to prioritize sites for active virus surveillance and developing awareness and prevention programs to reduce the risk of NiV spillover and spread in Thailand.

TI  - A Survey of Zoonotic Pathogens Carried by Non-Indigenous Rodents at the Interface of the Wet Tropics of North Queensland, Australia
T2  - TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES
AB  - In 1964, Brucella was isolated from rodents trapped in Wooroonooran National Park (WNP), in Northern Queensland, Australia. Genotyping of bacterial isolates in 2008 determined that they were a novel Brucella species. This study attempted to reisolate this species of Brucella from rodents living in the boundary area adjacent to WNP and to establish which endo-and ecto-parasites and bacterial agents were being carried by non-indigenous rodents at this interface. Seventy non-indigenous rodents were trapped [Mus musculus (52), Rattus rattus (17) and Rattus norvegicus (1)], euthanized and sampled on four properties adjacent to the WNP in July 2012. Organ pools were screened by culture for Salmonella, Leptospira and Brucella species, real-time PCR for Coxiella burnetii and conventional PCR for Leptospira. Collected ecto-and endo-parasites were identified using morphological criteria. The percentage of rodents carrying pathogens were Leptospira (40%), Salmonella choleraesuis ssp. arizonae (14.29%), ectoparasites (21.42%) and endoparasites (87%). Brucella and C. burnetii were not identified, and it was concluded that their prevalences were below 12%. Two rodent-specific helminthic species, namely Syphacia obvelata (2.86%) and Nippostrongylus brasiliensis (85.71%), were identified. The most prevalent ectoparasites belonged to Laelaps spp. (41.17%) followed by Polyplax spp. (23.53%), Hoplopleura spp. (17.65%), Ixodes holocyclus (17.64%) and Stephanocircus harrisoni (5.88%), respectively. These ectoparasites, except S. harrisoni, are known to transmit zoonotic pathogens such as Rickettsia spp. from rat to rat and could be transmitted to humans by other arthropods that bite humans. The high prevalence of pathogenic Leptospira species is of significant public health concern. This is the first known study of zoonotic agents carried by non-indigenous rodents living in the Australian wet-tropical forest interface.

TI  - INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH ON BIOMEDICINES FROM THE TROPICAL RAIN-FOREST
T2  - INTERCIENCIA
AB  - The phytochemistry and pharmacognosy of medicinal plants from the tropical rain forest has been a focus of research at the University of California at Irvine and Cornell University.  One interesting aspect of our investigations is the discovery that many animals (particularly primates) treat their maladies by consuming plants with pharmacologically active chemicals.  We have termed this medicinal consumption of plants by animals as Zoopharmacognosy.
   To help prepare a larger cadre of scientists to work in the biomedical sciences, our laboratories have developed a new undergraduate research program with support from the National Institutes of Health Fogarty International Center.  The major purpose of this program is to provide international training to graduate and undergraduate students from groups that are underrespresented in the biomedical sciences.  Consequently we have established collaborative arrangements with researchers at universities in Latin America and Africa to help train these minority biomedical sciences students in an international setting.  The collaborative institutions in Latin America include the Instituto Venezolano de Investigaciones Cientificas (IVIC), the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM), the Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia and the Universidad Nacional de Costa Rica.  Our collaborating institutions in Africa include Harvard University and Makerere University in Uganda.
   The research focus of the students going to Venezuela was twofold:  1) they received training in virology from a study of the avian viruses at the ecological reserve at Hato Pinero; 2) they also conducted research on the ethnopharmacology of a native group (the Yekuana Indians) in the Amazon rain forest portion of Venezuela.
   The students in Costa Rica are seeking to identify the chemical constituents of plants that the capuchin monkeys rub on their fur for presumed medicinal purposes.  The program in Peru is investigating the local herbal cures for the endemic Leishmania parasites.  In Africa, the students are investigating aspects of the medicinal usage of plants by local primates (primarily chimpanzees and gorillas).  Students and our senior laboratory personnel are also investigating aspects of the pharmacology and toxicology of the plants used by the local human inhabitants infected by the HIV virus.

TI  - Clinical & epidemiological significance of Kyasanur forest disease
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL RESEARCH
AB  - Kyasanur forest disease (KFD) is a known viral haemorrhagic fever in India, for the last 60 years. However, in recent years, the change in epidemiological profile of the disease has suggested that it is now time to consider KFD as an emerging tropical disease in India. The preference should be to educate not only the villagers where it is being reported or detected but also to public health experts, veterinarians, forest officials and medical professionals to pay attention while seeing a patient overlapping with endemic diseases such as Japanese encephalitis, West Nile, dengue, chikungunya, malaria and tuberculosis. Although the existence of KFD is known for a long time, updated understanding of its clinical profile in humans is still limited. This article describes in detail the clinical presentation of KFD reported till date. It also highlights geographical distribution of the disease, risk factors for virus transmission, biochemical/haematological findings and control measures. There is an urgent need for research on KFD, particularly for understanding biphasic nature of illness, development of cost-effective diagnostic tools, utility of non-invasive samples for diagnosis and development of new vaccines.

TI  - Estimation of Vectorial Capacity of <i>Anopheles dirus</i> (Diptera: Culicidae) in a Forest-Fringed Village of Assam (India)
T2  - VECTOR-BORNE AND ZOONOTIC DISEASES
AB  - To estimate the vectorial capacity of Anopheles dirus, the main vector of forest malaria in the northeastern region of India, in order to gain an understanding of entomological factors related to malaria transmission in forest-fringe areas of Assam, India, an isolated village in the tropical rain forest-fringed area in the district of Dibrugarh, Assam, under the influence of An. dirus alone was studied. Data on various entomological variables required for computation of the vectorial capacity were generated in each month from June 1999 to May 2000 in the field using standard techniques. Malaria prevalence was also studied during the same period in the study village and correlated with the estimated vectorial capacity of An. dirus. Vectorial capacity of An. dirus was highest, 0.779 for Plasmodium vivax (Pv) and 0.649 for Plasmodium falciparum (Pf), during the hot-monsoon season (June-September) and decreased to 0.08 (Pv) and 0.07(Pf) in the temperate postmonsoon season (October-November) before attaining zero values in the cool-dry season (December-February). With increasing temperature in the temperate premonsoon season (March-May), vectorial capacity recorded was 0.119 and 0.82 for Pv and Pf, respectively. Significant positive correlation was seen between the estimated vectorial capacity of An. dirus and the number of new Pf (r = 0.86, p < 0.001) and Pv (r = 0.69, p < 0.02) cases in the study village in different months. Thus, this study highlights the pattern of malaria transmission by An. dirus in a forest-fringe area of Assam that begins in March, peaks in July/August, subsides by November, and remains interrupted between December and February. Measures for controlling malaria in forest-fringe areas should be scheduled accordingly.

TI  - Estimating the potential of wild foods for nutrition and food security planning in tropical areas: Experimentation with a method in Northwestern Colombia
T2  - AMBIO
AB  - Wild foods contribute to the food security of multiple communities in tropical areas of Africa, Asia and Latin America. However, wild foods are not regularly considered in the planning of strategies for food and nutrition security mainly due to the lack of technical and/or scientific knowledge so that they can be considered suitable for human consumption. This paper proposes a multidisciplinary method that estimates the potential of wild foods as alternative resources when planning interventions in favour of food and nutrition security in tropical forest territories. When designing the method, four dimensions were identified in science, technology and innovation (STI) that define this potential as well as ten assessment criteria. The wild foods chosen for applying the method were Alibertia patinoi (a fruit commonly known as Borojo) and Proechimys semispinosus (Mouse of thorns), which are two of the main wild foods traditionally used by human communities in a tropical forest territory in the northwest of Colombia. In both cases, although there are significant advances in STI, compliance with some criteria is still required to regard them as viable alternatives for nutrition and food security within this territory. This research is useful for promoting the inclusion of wild food in food security programmes for communities where this food is already included in their traditional pattern of consumption and identifies the progress needed in STI to achieve this purpose. It may also promote the early recognition of possible traditional and cultural practices with high risk of transmission of pathogenic elements by the handling and/or inadequate consumption of wild foods. This early recognition could contribute to the prevention of diseases of wild animal origin, including those of rapid global spread.

TI  - Mapping natural forest cover using satellite imagery of Nkandla forest reserve, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Natural forest ecosystems are vital environmental resources that provide multiple benefits to society, making it imperative for them to be monitored and mapped for practical management purposes. Satellite remote sensing technology is a new source of data and information for forest management and conservation. This study, therefore, applied Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms to Landsat 8 image for mapping a natural forest in South Africa. The objectives were to classify the forest into specific thematic cover classes that indicate its condition, compare the classification performance of the two algorithms based on their default parameters, and determine the most important variables that contributed to the mapping accuracy. The closed canopy forest was determined as the dominant thematic class, followed in descending order by the open canopy forest, grassland, and bare sites. Both algorithms obtained high classification accuracies of above 95%, though the SVM was slightly superior to the RF. The McNemer test indicated that the difference in performance between the two algorithms was statistically insignificant. The most important variables that contributed to the accuracy were the red, blue, green, Near Infrared and Short-Wave Infrared bands, which is attributed to their sensitivity to vegetation. The information provided through the study can be utilized for the planning, management and prioritization initiatives aimed at the protection and conservation of the forest reserve and similar forest ecosystems. The mapping approach could be used for other natural forest ecosystems to ascertain the spatial coverage of the specific thematic cover for conservation purposes. The SVM is recommended for forest ecosystem mapping as it optimally utilized the capabilities of the spectral bands that reflect their actual importance in the mapping of each cover class. The bands identified as important variables can be incorporated as part of input variables when using Landsat 8 satellite imagery for natural forest mapping.

TI  - Evaluating Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 Data to Map Sucessional Forest Stages in a Subtropical Forest in Southern Brazil
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Studies designed to discriminate different successional forest stages play a strategic role in forest management, forest policy and environmental conservation in tropical environments. The discrimination of different successional forest stages is still a challenge due to the spectral similarity among the concerned classes. Considering this, the objective of this paper was to investigate the performance of Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 data for discriminating different successional forest stages of a patch located in a subtropical portion of the Atlantic Rain Forest in Southern Brazil with the aid of two machine learning algorithms and relying on the use of spectral reflectance data selected over two seasons and attributes thereof derived. Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were used as classifiers with different subsets of predictor variables (multitemporal spectral reflectance, textural metrics and vegetation indices). All the experiments reached satisfactory results, with Kappa indices varying between 0.9, with Landsat-8 spectral reflectance alone and the SVM algorithm, and 0.98, with Sentinel-2 spectral reflectance alone also associated with the SVM algorithm. The Landsat-8 data had a significant increase in accuracy with the inclusion of other predictor variables in the classification process besides the pure spectral reflectance bands. The classification methods SVM and RF had similar performances in general. As to the RF method, the texture mean of the red-edge and SWIR bands were considered the most important ranked attributes for the classification of Sentinel-2 data, while attributes resulting from multitemporal bands, textural metrics of SWIR bands and vegetation indices were the most important ones in the Landsat-8 data classification.

TI  - Incidence of leaf pathogens in the canopy of a Mexican tropical wet forest
T2  - PLANT ECOLOGY
AB  - The patterns of leaf pathogen attack and mechanisms of infection in the canopy of a Mexican tropical rain forest are described based on a survey of 30 tree and liana species. The study included the identification of the causal agents of pathogenic damage, as well as a description of the magnitude, interspecific and seasonal variation of leaf damage. Foliage of all tree species was attacked by fungal pathogens that caused leaf spots. Sixty two percent of the leaves surveyed in the dry season (N = 4348), and 59% of the leaves surveyed in the wet season (N = 3077) showed evidence of damage by fungal pathogens. Overall, leaf area damaged per plant was very low and similar in both seasons (less than or equal to 5% of leaf area damaged). Within the low levels of damage, there was considerable variation in the degree of infection among species: the percentage of diseased leaves ranged from 12 to 97.19, while leaf area damaged per plant ranged from 0.90 to 12.54%. A salient pattern of the survey is that 59% of the leaves in the dry season and 54% of the leaves surveyed in the wet season were concurrently attacked by herbivores and fungal pathogens, and only between 2 and 4% of the leaves bore damage by pathogens alone (dry and wet seasons respectively). Pathogenicity assays experimentally confirmed that the predominant mechanism of fungal establishment was wounding, such as that caused by herbivory and only rarely did infection occur through direct contact (without wounds). This study reveals that leaf fungal diseases are a prevalent component of the foliage in the tropical rain forest canopy, although the magnitude of affected leaf area is considerably low.

TI  - Spatial distribution and spread potential of sixteen <i>Leptospira</i> serovars in a subtropical region of Brazil
T2  - TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES
AB  - Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease that represents a major problem in animal and public health due to its high prevalence and widespread distribution. This zoonotic disease is most prevalent in tropical environments where conditions favour pathogen survival. The ecological preferences of Leptospira serovars are poorly understood, limiting our knowledge of where and when outbreaks can occur, which may result in misinformed prevention and control plans. While the disease can occur consistently in time and space in tropical regions, research on the ecology of leptospirosis remains limited in subtropical regions. This research gap regarding Leptospira ecology brings public and veterinary health problems, impacting local economies. To fill this gap of knowledge, we suggest to assess geographic and ecological features among Leptospira serovars in a subtropical area of Brazil where leptospirosis is endemic to (a) highlight environmental conditions that facilitate or limit Leptospira spread and survival and (b) reconstruct its geographic distribution. An ecological niche modelling framework was used to characterize and compare Leptospira serovars in both geographic and environmental space. Our results show that despite the geographic overlap exhibited by the different serovars assessed, we found ecological divergence among their occupied ecological niches. Ecological divergences were expressed as ranges of potential distributions and environmental conditions found suitably by serovar, Sejroe being the most asymmetric (<0.15). Most important predictors for the potential distribution of most serovars were soil pH (31.7%) and landscape temperature (24.2%). Identification of environmental preferences will allow epidemiologists to better infer the presence of a serovar based on the environmental characteristics of regions rather than inferences based solely on historical epidemiological records. Including geographic and ecological ranges of serovars also may help to forecast transmission potential of Leptospira in public health and the food animal practice.

TI  - Mapping Secondary Vegetation of a Region of Deforestation Hotspot in the Brazilian Amazon: Performance Analysis of C- and L-Band SAR Data Acquired in the Rainy Season
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - The re-suppression of secondary vegetation (SV) in the Brazilian Amazon for agriculture or land speculation occurs mostly in the rainy season. The use of optical images to monitor such re-suppression during the rainy season is limited because of the persistent cloud cover. This study aimed to evaluate the potential of C- and L-band SAR data acquired in the rainy season to discriminate SV in an area of new hotspot of deforestation in the municipality of Colniza, northwestern of Mato Grosso State, Brazil. This is the first time that the potential of dual-frequency SAR data was analyzed to discriminate SV, with an emphasis on data acquired during the rainy season. The L-band ALOS/PALSAR-2 and the C-band Sentinel-1 data acquired in March 2018 were processed to obtain backscattering coefficients and nine textural attributes were derived from the gray level co-occurrence matrix method (GLCM). Then, we classified the images based on the non-parametric Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms. The use of SAR textural attributes improved the discrimination capability of different LULC classes found in the study area. The results showed the best performance of ALOS/PALSAR-2 data classified by the RF algorithm to discriminate the following representative land use and land cover classes of the study area: primary forest, secondary forest, shrubby pasture, clean pasture, and bare soil, with an overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient of 84% and 0.78, respectively. The RF outperformed the SVM classifier to discriminate these five LULC classes in 14% of overall accuracy for both ALOS-2 and Sentinel-1 data sets. This study also showed that the textural attributes derived from the GLCM method are highly sensitive to the moving window size to be applied to the GLCM method. The results of this study can assist the future development of an operation system based on dual-frequency SAR data to monitor re-suppression of SV in the Brazilian Amazon or in other tropical rainforests.

TI  - Phenology of <i>Bursera</i> <i>simaruba</i> and <i>Bursera</i> <i>tomentosa</i> at a tropical dry forest of Chiapas, Mexico
T2  - MADERA Y BOSQUES
AB  - The genus Bursera is a characteristic component of the tropical dry forest (TDF) of Mexico, however, despite being relevant for the conservation and management of the species, its biology is little known, among them, their phenological patterns and their associations with seasonal factors. The aim of this research was to characterize the phenology of Bursera simaruba Jacq. ex L and Bursera tomentosa (Jacq.) Triana & Planch and to evaluate their relationship with environmental variables. The phenological study was realized in a protected area with tropical dry forest of the Central Depresion from Chiapas. Fifty adult trees of each specie were selected and the intensity of four reproductive phenophases (flower bud, open flower, fruit development and permanence of fruits) and three vegetative ones (leaf bud, mature leaves, senescence) were recorded using the Fournier method. Seasonality and synchrony in each phase were estimated by circular statistics calculating the mean vector (r) and the Rayleight test (Z). Also, the functional types of vegetative phenology were categorized and that of reproductive phenology. All the phenological stages were seasonal (r> 0.5), in both species, the flowering and leaf bud phenophases occurred in a short period while the vegetative and fruit production phenophases are the more extended stages. The reproductive and vegetative phenology of Bursera simaruba and B. tomentosa were very similar, and the most correlated environmental variables with them (r(s) >= 0.6) were temperature and humidity. These results allow to know the phenological dynamic of Bursera species in the TDF, and with this, to promote management and conservation strategies of these important species.

TI  - Exposure and infection to <i>Plasmodium knowlesi</i> in case study communities in Northern Sabah, Malaysia and Palawan, The Philippines
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   Primarily impacting poor, rural populations, the zoonotic malaria Plasmodium knowlesi is now the main cause of human malaria within Malaysian Borneo. While data is increasingly available on symptomatic cases, little is known about community-level patterns of exposure and infection. Understanding the true burden of disease and associated risk factors within endemic communities is critical for informing evidence-based control measures.
   Methodology/Principal findings
   We conducted comprehensive surveys in three areas where P. knowlesi transmission is reported: Limbuak, Pulau Banggi and Matunggung, Kudat, Sabah, Malaysia and Bacungan, Palawan, the Philippines. Infection prevalence was low with parasites detected by PCR in only 0.2% (4/2503) of the population. P. knowlesi PkSERA3 ag1 antibody responses were detected in 7.1% (95% CI: 6.2-8.2%) of the population, compared with 16.1% (14.6-17.7%) and 12.6% (11.2-14.1%) for P. falciparum and P. vivax. Sero-prevalence was low in individuals <10 years old for P. falciparum and P. vivax consistent with decreased transmission of non-zoonotic malaria species. Results indicated marked heterogeneity in transmission intensity between sites and P. knowlesi exposure was associated with agricultural work (OR 1.63; 95% CI 1.07-2.48) and higher levels of forest cover (OR 2.40; 95% CI 1.29-4.46) and clearing (OR 2.14; 95% CI 1.35-3.40) around houses. Spatial patterns of P. knowlesi exposure differed from exposure to non-zoonotic malaria and P. knowlesi exposed individuals were younger on average than individuals exposed to non-zoonotic malaria.
   Conclusions/Significance
   This is the first study to describe serological exposure to P. knowlesi and associated risk factors within endemic communities. Results indicate community-level patterns of infection and exposure differ markedly from demographics of reported cases, with higher levels of exposure among women and children. Further work is needed to understand these variations in risk across a wider population and spatial scale.

TI  - Possible implications of seed dispersal by the howler monkey for the early recruitment of a legume tree in small rain-forest fragments in Mexico
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY
AB  - Primates are important seed dispersers in tropical forests, but they are being lost due to forest fragmentation. We compared post-dispersal seed fate and seedling density for the tree Dialium guianense, in forest fragments in which its main seed disperser, the mantled howler monkey (Alouatta palliata) is present, and in fragments in which it is absent. We also carried out a germination experiment to assess gut-passage effect. Seeds extracted from fruits had very low germination (2%) compared with defecated seeds (70%). Seeds in monkey faeces had a lower probability of being attacked by predators, but a higher probability of being attacked by fungus, when compared with seeds inside fruits. Seed fate was similar in fragments with vs. without monkeys, and in sites under parent trees vs. under monkey sleeping sites. Seedling density was highest under sleeping sites in fragments with monkeys, followed by sites under parent trees in fragments with monkeys, and it was lowest in uninhabited fragments, regardless of deposition site. Our study adds to an increasing line of evidence suggesting that loss of frugivores can have strong consequences for plant recruitment.

TI  - Community Structure, Biodiversity and Spatiotemporal Distribution of the Black Flies (Diptera: Simuliidae) Using Malaise Traps on the Highest Mountain in Thailand
T2  - INSECTS
AB  - Simple Summary Black flies, also known as buffalo gnats, are major pests to humans and animals. Females of some black fly species serve as vectors for transmitting several pathogens (i.e., filarial nematodes, blood protozoa, viruses, and bacteria) to humans and animals via their bites. In Thailand, some human-biting species are considered as natural vectors of zoonotic onchocerciasis. This study was the first to contribute baseline data on the community structure, biodiversity and spatial and temporal distribution of adult black flies in tropical forests of the highest mountain in northern Thailand, Doi Inthanon National Park, by using malaise traps. Adult black flies were captured monthly at low to high elevation sites, using malaise traps across three seasons during a one-year period. A total of 44 species were identified among 9406 specimens. It was found that species richness was greatest at the mid elevation. Black fly populations peaked in the rainy season at all elevation sites. The findings of this study showed that varied elevations and seasons are important factors that influence the distribution and abundance of black flies in this region. Black flies form a group of small blood-sucking insects of medical and veterinary importance. This study aimed to investigate the community structure, biodiversity and spatial and temporal distribution of adult black flies in tropical rain forests, by using malaise traps in Doi Inthanon National Park, northern Thailand. Malaise traps were placed along six elevational gradients (400 m to 2500 m, above sea level) at Doi Inthanon National Park, Chiang Mai province, from December 2013 to November 2014. A total of 9406 adult female black flies belonging to five subgenera-Daviesellum (2%), Gomphostilbia (23%), Montisimulium (11%), Nevermannia (16%) and Simulium (48%)-were collected. Among 44 taxa found, S. tenebrosum complex had the highest relative abundance (11.1%), followed by the S. asakoae species-group (9.6%), the S. striatum species-group (7.7%), S. inthanonense (6.6%), S. doipuiense complex (6.4%), S. chomthongense complex (5.3%), S. chumpornense (5.1%) and S. nigrogilvum (4.1%). Two human-biting species-S. nigrogilvum and species in the S. asakoae species-group-were found in all of the collection sites with 100% species occurrence. Species richness was highest at mid elevation (1400 m), which is represented by 19 black fly species. The peak and lowest seasonal abundance was observed in the rainy and hot season, respectively. Seasonal species richness was highest in the cold season, except for that from elevation sites at 700 m, 1700 m and 2500 m. This study revealed that the malaise trap is effective in providing important data for further monitoring of the effects of environmental changes and conservation planning on the biodiversity of black flies in Doi Inthanon National Park.

TI  - Effects of forest degradation on the sand fly communities of northeast Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF VECTOR ECOLOGY
AB  - The richness and abundance of sand fly species were studied in northeastern Brazil in areas of leishmaniasis transmission. The study was carried out in two forest areas with different deforestation times for agricultural and livestock activities: one modified by long-term settlement (more than 50 years of occupation) and another less impacted by short-term settlement (10 years). The sand flies were captured with CDC light traps from 18:00 to 06:00 for three consecutive nights, once a month, from May, 2012 to April, 2014. The study captured 21,708 specimens and also 33 species of Lutzomyia and two of Brumptomyia. Species richness and abundance were higher in the more conserved area of short-term occupation (31 species; 61.7%) than in the more degraded area with long-term occupation (17 species; 38.3%). In the most conserved area, the species richness was higher in the forest fragment than in the rural settlement, whereas in the degraded area the richness was higher in the peri-domicile than in the forest. The diversity was higher in the degraded area forest. There were significant statistical differences when comparing the means of total abundance with the intra-domicile, peri-domicile, and forest environments. The average abundance was statistically higher in the peri-domicile compared to the forest (p = 0.009), but there were no statistically significant differences between intra-domicile-peri-domicile (p = 0.11) and forest-intra-domicile (p = 0.87). In conclusion, a change in vegetation cover negatively affects the richness and abundance of sand flies in the natural environment.

TI  - FOREST ABOVE GROUND BIOMASS ESTIMATION AND FOREST/NON-FOREST CLASSIFICATION FOR ODISHA, INDIA, USING L-BAND SYNTHETIC APERTURE RADAR (SAR) DATA
T2  - ISPRS TECHNICAL COMMISSION VIII SYMPOSIUM
CP  - ISPRS Technical Commission VIII Symposium
AB  - Tropical forests contribute to approximately 40% of the total carbon found in terrestrial biomass. In this context, forest/non-forest classification and estimation of forest above ground biomass over tropical regions are very important and relevant in understanding the contribution of tropical forests in global biogeochemical cycles, especially in terms of carbon pools and fluxes. Information on the spatio-temporal biomass distribution acts as a key input to Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation Plus (REDD+) action plans. This necessitates precise and reliable methods to estimate forest biomass and to reduce uncertainties in existing biomass quantification scenarios.
   The use of backscatter information from a host of all-weather capable Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) systems during the recent past has demonstrated the potential of SAR data in forest above ground biomass estimation and forest/nonforest classification.
   In the present study, Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS)/Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) data along with field inventory data have been used in forest above ground biomass estimation and forest/non-forest classification over Odisha state, India. The ALOS-PALSAR 50m spatial resolution orthorectified and radiometrically corrected HH/HV dual polarization data (digital numbers) for the year 2010 were converted to backscattering coefficient images (Schimada et al., 2009).
   The tree level measurements collected during field inventory (2009-'10) on Girth at Breast Height (GBH at 1.3m above ground) and height of all individual trees at plot (plot size 0.1ha) level were converted to biomass density using species specific allometric equations and wood densities. The field inventory based biomass estimations were empirically integrated with ALOS-PALSAR backscatter coefficients to derive spatial forest above ground biomass estimates for the study area.
   Further, The Support Vector Machines (SVM) based Radial Basis Function classification technique was employed to carry out binary (forest-non forest) classification using ALOS-PALSAR HH and HV backscatter coefficient images and field inventory data. The textural Haralick's Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) texture measures are determined on HV backscatter image for Odisha, for the year 2010. PALSAR HH, HV backscatter coefficient images, their difference (HH-HV) and HV backscatter coefficient based eight textural parameters (Mean, Variance, Dissimilarity, Contrast, Angular second moment, Homogeneity, Correlation and Contrast) are used as input parameters for Support Vector Machines (SVM) tool. Ground based inputs for forest/non-forest were taken from field inventory data and high resolution Google maps.
   Results suggested significant relationship between HV backscatter coefficient and field based biomass (R-2 = 0.508, p = 0.55) compared to HH with biomass values ranging from 5 to 365 t/ha. The spatial variability of biomass with reference to different forest types is in good agreement. The forest/non-forest classified map suggested a total forest cover of 50214 km(2) with an overall accuracy of 92.54%. The forest/non-forest information derived from the present study showed a good spatial agreement with the standard forest cover map of Forest Survey of India (FSI) and corresponding published area of 50575 km(2). Results are discussed in the paper

TI  - Local host-tick coextinction in neotropical forest fragments
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY
AB  - Ticks are obligatory parasites with complex life cycles that often depend on larger bodied vertebrates as final hosts. These traits make them particularly sensitive to local coextinction with their host. Loss of wildlife abundance and diversity should thus lead to loss of tick abundance and diversity to the point where only generalist tick species remain. However, direct empirical tests of these hypotheses are lacking, despite their relevance to our understanding of tick-borne disease emergence in disturbed environments. Here, we compare vertebrate and tick communities across 12 forest islands and peninsulas in the Panama Canal that ranged 1000-fold in size (2.6-2811.3 ha). We used drag sampling and camera trapping to directly assess the abundance and diversity of communities of questing ticks and vertebrate hosts. We found that the abundance and species richness of ticks were positively related to those of wildlife. Specialist tick species were only present in fragments where their final hosts were found. Further, less diverse tick communities had a higher relative abundance of the generalist tick species Amblyomma oblongoguttatum, a potential vector of spotted fever group rickettsiosis. These findings support the host-parasite coextinction hypothesis, and indicate that loss of wildlife can indeed have cascading effects on tick communities. Our results also imply that opportunities for pathogen transmission via generalist ticks may be higher in habitats with degraded tick communities. If these patterns are general, then tick identities and abundances serve as useful bioindicators of ecosystem health, with low tick diversity reflecting low wildlife diversity and a potentially elevated risk of interspecific disease transmission via remaining host species and generalist ticks.

TI  - Seasonal differences in population-, ensemble- and community-level responses of bats to landscape structure in Amazonia
T2  - OIKOS
AB  - The amount (composition) and spatial arrangement (configuration) of forest patches in fragmented landscapes influence the accessibility, as well as the abundance and diversity of resources available to bats. Moreover, tropical fruit and insect abundance differ seasonally in response to changes in precipitation, and many bats in the family Phyllostomidae employ seasonal reproductive strategies. Because reproductive activities involve constraints on time and energy as well as increased nutritional demands, foraging behavior and home range size may differ between wet and dry seasons. Nonetheless, seasonal variation in response to landscape structure by bats has not been examined previously. Consequently, population-, ensemble- and assemblage-level responses of phyllostomids to landscape composition and configuration were quantified separately during the wet and dry season at three circular focal scales (1, 3 and 5 km radii) for 14 sites in fragmented lowland Amazon forest. Responses to landscape characteristics were scale-dependent, species-specific, and seasonal. Abundances of frugivores responded to landscape composition in the dry season and to landscape configuration in the wet season. Conversely, abundances of animalivores responded to landscape configuration in the dry season and to landscape composition in the wet season. Divergent responses to landscape structure between seasons suggest that variation in resource abundance and diversity play a significant role in structuring population-, ensemble- and assemblage-level patterns. As such, considerations of the effects of dietary flexibility and reproductive constraints on foraging strategies and habitat use may be important when designing management plans that successfully promote long-term persistence of biodiversity in fragmented landscapes.

TI  - A Mapping Review on Urban Landscape Factors of Dengue Retrieved from Earth Observation Data, GIS Techniques, and Survey Questionnaires
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - To date, there is no effective treatment to cure dengue fever, a mosquito-borne disease which has a major impact on human populations in tropical and sub-tropical regions. Although the characteristics of dengue infection are well known, factors associated with landscape are highly scale dependent in time and space, and therefore difficult to monitor. We propose here a mapping review based on 78 articles that study the relationships between landscape factors and urban dengue cases considering household, neighborhood and administrative levels. Landscape factors were retrieved from survey questionnaires, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), and remote sensing (RS) techniques. We structured these into groups composed of land cover, land use, and housing type and characteristics, as well as subgroups referring to construction material, urban typology, and infrastructure level. We mapped the co-occurrence networks associated with these factors, and analyzed their relevance according to a three-valued interpretation (positive, negative, non significant). From a methodological perspective, coupling RS and GIS techniques with field surveys including entomological observations should be systematically considered, as none digital land use or land cover variables appears to be an univocal determinant of dengue occurrences. Remote sensing urban mapping is however of interest to provide a geographical frame to distribute human population and movement in relation to their activities in the city, and as spatialized input variables for epidemiological and entomological models.

TI  - Habitat disturbance results in chronic stress and impaired health status in forest-dwelling paleotropical bats
T2  - CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY
AB  - Anthropogenic habitat disturbance is a major threat to biodiversity worldwide. Yet, before population declines are detectable, individuals may suffer from chronic stress and impaired immunity in disturbed habitats, making them more susceptible to pathogens and adverse weather conditions. Here, we tested in a paleotropical forest with ongoing logging and fragmentation, whether habitat disturbance influences the body mass and immunity of bats. We measured and compared body mass, chronic stress (indicated by neutrophil to lymphocyte ratios) and the number of circulating immune cells between several bat species with different roost types living in recovering areas, actively logged forests, and fragmented forests in Sabah, Malaysia. In a cave-roosting species, chronic stress levels were higher in individuals from fragmented habitats compared with conspecifics from actively logged areas. Foliage-roosting species showed a reduced body mass and decrease in total white blood cell counts in actively logged areas and fragmented forests compared with conspecifics living in recovering habitats. Our study highlights that habitat disturbance may have species-specific effects on chronic stress and immunity in bats that are potentially related to the roost type. We identified foliage-roosting species as particularly sensitive to forest habitat deterioration. These species may face a heightened extinction risk in the near future if anthropogenic habitat alterations continue.

TI  - Persistent mosquito fogging can be detrimental to non-target invertebrates in an urban tropical forest
T2  - PEERJ
AB  - Background: Human population growth has led to biodiversity declines in tropical cities. While habitat loss and fragmentation have been the main drivers of urban biodiversity loss, man-made interventions to reduce health risks have also emerged as an unintentional threat. For instance, insecticide fogging to control mosquito populations has become the most common method of preventing the expansion of mosquito-borne diseases such as Dengue. However, the effectiveness of fogging in killing mosquitoes has been called into question. One concern is the unintended effect of insecticide fogging on non-target invertebrates that are crucial for the maintenance of urban ecosystems. Here, we investigate the impacts of fogging on: (1) target invertebrate taxon (Diptera, including mosquitoes); (2) non-target invertebrate taxa; and (3) the foraging behavior of an invertebrate pollinator taxon (Lepidoptera) within an urban tropical forest.
   Methods: We carried out fogging with Pyrethroid insecticide (Detral 2.5 EC) at 10 different sites in a forest situated in the state of Selangor, Peninsular Malaysia. Across the sites, we counted the numbers of knocked-down invertebrates and identified them based on morphology to different taxa. We constructed Bayesian hierarchical Poisson regression models to investigate the effects of fogging on: (1) a target invertebrate taxon (Diptera) 3-h post-fogging; (2) selected non-target invertebrate taxa 3-h post-fogging; and (3) an invertebrate pollinator taxon (Lepidoptera) 24-h post-fogging.
   Results: A total of 1,874 invertebrates from 19 invertebrate orders were knocked down by the fogging treatment across the 10 sites. Furthermore, 72.7% of the invertebrates counted 3-h post-fogging was considered dead. Our regression models showed that given the data and prior information, the probability that fogging had a negative effect on invertebrate taxa 3-h post-fogging was 100%, with reductions to 11% of the pre-fogging count of live individuals for the target invertebrate taxon (Diptera), and between 5% and 58% of the pre-fogging count of live individuals for non-target invertebrate taxa. For the invertebrate pollinator, the probability that fogging had a negative effect 24-h post-fogging was also 100%, with reductions to 53% of the pre-fogging count of live individuals.
   Discussion: Our Bayesian models unequivocally demonstrate that fogging has detrimental effects on one pollinator order and non-target invertebrate orders, especially taxa that have comparatively lower levels of chitinisation. While fogging is effective in killing the target order (Diptera), no mosquitos were found dead in our experiment. In order to maintain urban biodiversity, we recommend that health authorities and the private sector move away from persistent insecticide fogging and to explore alternative measures to control adult mosquito populations.

TI  - Medicinal <i>Vitex species</i> (Lamiaceae) occupy different niches in Haut-Katanga tropical dry woodlands
T2  - PLANT ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB  - Background and aims - Sustainable management of the medicinal plant resources provided by tropical forests is of utmost importance to human populations in developing countries. Trees and shrubs of the genus Vitex (Lamiaceae) are of great medicinal importance in Haut-Katanga (SE D.R. Congo), frequently used to treat tropical diseases. However, the security of supply is threatened, particularly by urban sprawl and mining. A conservation strategy for medicinal plants is urgently needed. In this context, we try to better understand the ecological factors (mostly soil) explaining the distribution of three medicinal species of Vitex (Lamiaceae) (V. fischeri, V. madiensis, and V. mombassae) that co-occur in the tropical dry woodlands in the region of Lubumbashi.
   Material and methods - In 114 plots (10 m radius), comprising at least one species of Vitex, all woody species with a DBH = 10 cm were inventoried and soil samples were collected. Multivariate Regression Trees (MRT) combined with indicator species index IndVal and Redundancy analysis (RDA) were used to characterise habitats and woody plant communities associated to each Vitex species and to explain the variability of plant community composition.
   Key results - Four habitats were identified, and the three Vitex species differ significantly in ecological range. Vitex fischeri is a specialist of a most distinctive community on high Mg and low Al soil (termite mounds). Vitex mombassae is indicative of one habitat, corresponding to low altitude (< 1230 m) plots. Vitex madiensis has a broader range, being a generalist of all habitats except termite mounds.
   Conclusion - These results emphasise the importance of a detailed knowledge of species ecology to design speciesspecific conservation strategies, even for congeneric species occurring in sympatry in the same landscape.

TI  - Semi-Supervised Methods to Identify Individual Crowns of Lowland Tropical Canopy Species Using Imaging Spectroscopy and LiDAR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Our objective is to identify and map individuals of nine tree species in a Hawaiian lowland tropical forest by comparing the performance of a variety of semi-supervised classifiers. A method was adapted to process hyperspectral imagery, LiDAR intensity variables, and LiDAR-derived canopy height and use them to assess the identification accuracy. We found that semi-supervised Support Vector Machine classification using tensor summation kernel was superior to supervised classification, with demonstrable accuracy for at least eight out of nine species, and for all combinations of data types tested. We also found that the combination of hyperspectral imagery and LiDAR data usually improved species classification. Both LiDAR intensity and LiDAR canopy height proved useful for classification of certain species, but the improvements varied depending upon the species in question. Our results pave the way for target-species identification in tropical forests and other ecosystems.

TI  - Tropical dermatology: Fungal tropical diseases
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY
AB  - Fungal infections are common in tropical countries and can have an important impact on public health. Lobomycosis is a common fungal infection in the tropical rain forest of South America, and paracoccidioidomycosis (South American blastomycosis) is a widespread and sometimes severe illness. Penicilliosis marneffei is an opportunistic infection of AIDS patients in southeast Asia. Chromoblastomycosis and mycetomas are causes of morbicity around the world. Sporotrichosis is a worldwide subcutaneous mycosis with a high incidence in tropical countries and is an important illness in immunocompromised patients. Rhinosporidiosis was classed as a fungal infection but is now considered a protistan parasite that belongs to the class Mesomycetozoea. It is included in this review because of its historical classification. In the past, most of these mycoses were restricted to specific geographic areas and natural reservoirs. There are, however situations in which people fron other regions come in contact with the pathogen. A common situation involves an accidental contamination of a traveler or worker who has contact with a tropical mycosis. Even minor trauma to the skin surface or inhalation of the fungal conidia can infect the patient. Thus recognition of the clinical symptoms and the dermatologic findings of the disease, as well as the discusses some of the more common tropical subcutaneous and systemic mycoses, as well as their signs, symptoms, methods of diagnosis, and therapies.

CP  - Annual Conference of the Royal-Geographical-Society/Institute-of-British-Geographers
AB  - Aim The goal of this project was to compile, organize, and present the known distributional data on the dictyostelid cellular slime moulds (CSMs) found in forest soils worldwide. The question of what factors influence CSM distribution patterns was also addressed.
   Location CSMs have been recovered from soils of temperate deciduous forest, tropical deciduous and seasonal evergreen rainforest, boreal coniferous forest, and tundra by various investigators ground the world.
   Methods Within each of these four biomes, various locations around the world have been sampled by a number of investigators. The current study attempts to synthesize the known dictyostelid distributional data and present specific patterns of distribution.
   Results Worldwide, sixty-five species of CSM were found to occupy various forest soils. These species' distributions fell into one of four categories: cosmopolitan, disjunct, restricted, and pantropical.
   Main conclusions Global CSM distribution patterns are influenced by a variety of factors other than the biota (including but not restricted to climate, latitude, altitude, soil pH, and soil-forming parent materials). The current study supports the thesis that organic inputs from specific plant associations and animal vectors have an important role as well.

TI  - Reproductive phenology of climbers in a Southeastern Brazilian forest
T2  - BIOTROPICA
AB  - The reproductive phenology of the entire climber community (96 species of lianas and 40 species of vines) in a semideciduous forest in Southeastern Brazil (22 degrees 49'45''S; 47 degrees 06'33''W and 670 m altitude) was observed from March 1988 to February 1991. Phenological observations were made weekly by walking along a 10.5 km trail in the interior and at the forest edges of the Santa Genebra Reserve (SGR). The most species-rich families of climbers were Bignoniaceae (22), Malpighiaceae (17), Sapindaceae (12) and Asteraceae (12). Flowering patterns for woody lianas and herbaceous vines differed. Lianas had two flowering peaks: a minor peak in March in the transition from wet to dry season, and a major peak in October during the transition from dry to wet season. The flowering peak for herbaceous vines was in April. Fruiting of lianas was highly seasonal, with one peak in the late dry season (July-August). Fruiting for vines was less seasonal with a slight peak in March. These differences were consistent with the predominance of wind-dispersed fruits among lianas (72% of species) versus vines (52%). Low rainfall, high leaf fall, and strong winds during the dry season favor wind dispersal. More species of vines (40%) have animal-dispersed seeds than lianas (19%), and most vines fruited during the wet season. Phenological patterns of climbers and trees and treelets at SGR differed. The life form of lianas and their system of reserve economy may allow them to reproduce during periods unfavorable to trees. Displacement of peak flowering periods of trees and climbers pollinated by bees and small generalist insects may decrease competition for pollen vectors among species of these two groups of plants. Whereas the fruiting patterns of wind-dispersed trees and climbers at SGR were similar (most species fruiting during the dry season), animal-dispersed trees and treelets fruited throughout the year while animal-dispersed climbers exhibited a pronounced peak in late wet season. The distinct phenological patterns of climbers, generally complementary to those presented by trees, resulted in constant availability of Bowers and fruits throughout the year and enhances the importance of this plant group in Neotropical forests.

TI  - Forest degradation assessment of Ratargul Special Biodiversity Protection Area for conservation implications
T2  - FORESTIST
AB  - Forest degradation is threatening the biodiversity of moist tropical forests since the beginning of their development. Bangladesh is losing its forests and associated biodiversity continuously due to forest-dependent livelihoods. The only freshwater swamp forest of the Ratargul Special Biodiversity Protection Area in Bangladesh is also very prone to degradation due to anthropogenic disturbance. This distinct swamp forest has unique biological diversity compared to other forest types. To assess its degradation and to propose implications for conservation, sentinel images with 10x10 m resolution were used. Also, field data were collected and analyzed. This research produced a map of forest cover change and outlined an area that can be used in restoration planning. Branch cutting, dry season overgrazing, illegal tree felling, fuelwood collection, trampling by tourists, and insect and disease epidemics were identified as causes of degradation. Functional conservation effort ensured by strong political will and area-specific forest protection regulation is essential for the conservation of last swamp forest and its remnant biodiversity. Community-based conservation approaches need to be applied for mass awareness regarding this ecosystem's value and its sustainability.

TI  - Environmental and socioeconomic risk factors for visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis in Sao Paulo, Brazil
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Leishmaniasis is a vector-borne disease caused by the protozoan Leishmania spp. mainly affecting individuals of low socioeconomic status. In tropical regions the transmission risk to humans depends not only on environmental factors, such as vegetation cover and climate, but also on the socioeconomic characteristics of human populations. However, the relative contribution of these factors to disease risk and incidence is not well understood. Yet this information is critical for the development of epidemiological surveillance schemes and control practices. Leishmaniasis cases have increased in Sao Paulo state, Brazil over recent years but the underlying risk factors for transmission remain understudied. Here, we use generalized linear mixed models to quantify the association between occurrence and incidence (number of cases) of cutaneous (CL) and visceral (VL) leishmaniasis from 1998 to 2015, and landscape (native vegetation cover), climate (seasonal and interannual variation in precipitation and temperature) and socioeconomic factors (population, number of cattle heads, Human Development Index -HDI, Gini inequality index and income per capita) across the 645 municipalities of Sao Paulo state, Brazil. For CL, probability of occurrence was greater in municipalities with high native vegetation cover and economic inequality and in years with greater average winter precipitation. For VL, probability of occurrence was greater in years with high minimum spring precipitation and maximum annual temperatures, and in municipalities with larger HDI values and a greater number of cattle heads. The number of VL cases increased during years with high mean fall precipitation and, for both CL and VL the number of cases was greater in years of high annual mean temperature. Understanding how these risk factors influence spatial and temporal variation in the risk and incidence of leishmaniasis can contribute to the development of effective public health policies and interventions.

TI  - Use of Landsat and Corona data for mapping forest cover change from the mid-1960s to 2000s: Case studies from the Eastern United States and Central Brazil
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Land-cover change detection using satellite remote sensing is largely confined to the era of Landsat satellites, from 1972 to present. However, the Corona, Argon, and Lanyard intelligence satellites operated by the U.S. government between 1960 and 1972 have the potential to provide an important extension of the long-term record of Earth's land surface. Recently declassified, the archive of images recorded by these satellites contains hundreds of thousands of photographs, many of which have very high ground resolution- 6-9 ft (1.8-2.7 m) even by today's standards. This paper demonstrates methods for extending the span of forest-cover change analysis from the Landsat-5 and -7 era (1984 to present) to the previous era covered by the Corona archive in two study areas: one area covered predominantly by urban and sub-urban land uses in the eastern US and another area by tropical forest in central Brazil. We describe co-registration of Corona and Landsat images, extraction of texture features from Corona images, classification of Corona and Landsat images, and post-classification change detection based on the resulting thematic dataset. Second-order polynomial transformation of Corona images yielded geometric accuracy relative to Landsat-7 of 18.24 m for the urban area and 29.35 m for the tropical forest study area, generally deemed adequate for pixel-based change detection at Landsat resolution. Classification accuracies were approximately 95% and 96% for forest/non-forest discrimination for the temperate urban and tropical forest study areas, respectively. Texture within 7 x 7- to 9 x 9-pixel (similar to 13.0-16.5 m) neighborhoods and within 11 x 11-pixel (similar to 30 m) neighborhoods were the most informative metrics for forest classification in Corona images in the temperate and tropical study areas, respectively. The trajectory of change from the 1960s to 2000s differed between the two study areas: the average annual forest loss rate in the urban area doubled from 0.68% to 1.9% from the 1960s to the mid-1980s and then decreased during the following decade. In contrast, deforestation in the Brazilian study area continued at a slightly increased pace between the 1960s and 1990s at annual loss rate of 0.62-0.79% and quickly slowed down afterward. This study demonstrates the strong potential of declassified Corona images for detecting historical forest changes in these study regions and suggests increased utility for retrieving a wide range of land cover histories around the world.

TI  - Mapping Aboveground Biomass using Texture Indices from Aerial Photos in a Temperate Forest of Northeastern China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Optical remote sensing data have been considered to display signal saturation phenomena in regions of high aboveground biomass (AGB) and multi-storied forest canopies. However, some recent studies using texture indices derived from optical remote sensing data via the Fourier-based textural ordination (FOTO) approach have provided promising results without saturation problems for some tropical forests, which tend to underestimate AGB predictions. This study was applied to the temperate mixed forest of the Liangshui National Nature Reserve in Northeastern China and demonstrated the capability of FOTO texture indices to obtain a higher prediction quality of forest AGB. Based on high spatial resolution aerial photos (1.0 m spatial resolution) acquired in September 2009, the relationship between FOTO texture indices and field-derived biomass measurements was calibrated using a support vector regression (SVR) algorithm. Ten-fold cross-validation was used to construct a robust prediction model, which avoided the over-fitting problem. By further comparison the performance of the model estimates for greater coverage, the predicted results were compared with a reference biomass map derived from LiDAR metrics. This study showed that the FOTO indices accounted for 88.3% of the variance in ground-based AGB; the root mean square error (RMSE) was 34.35 t/ha, and RMSE normalized by the mean value of the estimates was 22.31%. This novel texture-based method has great potential for forest AGB estimation in other temperate regions.

TI  - Biotic and abiotic determinants of <i>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</i> infections in amphibians of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest
T2  - FUNGAL ECOLOGY
AB  - Latitudinal gradients are linked to the dynamics of infectious diseases. Both prevalence and infection intensity of the amphibian-killing fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), vary with latitude. Here, we tested whether abiotic and biotic factors are associated with Bd infection prevalence and intensity along a large latitudinal gradient across the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We detected a positive association between infection prevalence and infection intensity with latitude; elevation, temperature and precipitation best explained infection prevalence, while temperature best explained infection intensity. We also detected a positive association between species richness and Bd infections and associations between Bd infections with host reproductive biology and habitat type. This represents the longest and most thoroughly sampled latitudinal gradient of Bd in anuran populations. Our results corroborate earlier findings that abiotic factors are a major determinant of Bd infections and highlight the need for a better understanding of the role that species diversity plays in disease outcomes.

TI  - Effects of land use, habitat characteristics, and small mammal community composition on <i>Leptospira</i> prevalence in northeast Madagascar
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Human activities can increase or decrease risks of acquiring a zoonotic disease, notably by affecting the composition and abundance of hosts. This study investigated the links between land use and infectious disease risk in northeast Madagascar, where human subsistence activities and population growth are encroaching on native habitats and the associated biota. We collected new data on pathogenic Leptospira, which are bacteria maintained in small mammal reservoirs. Transmission can occur through close contact, but most frequently through indirect contact with water contaminated by the urine of infected hosts. The probability of infection and prevalence was compared across a gradient of natural moist evergreen forest, nearby forest fragments, flooded rice and other types of agricultural fields, and in homes in a rural village. Using these data, we tested specific hypotheses for how land use alters ecological communities and influences disease transmission. The relative abundance and proportion of exotic species was highest in the anthropogenic habitats, while the relative abundance of native species was highest in the forested habitats. Prevalence of Leptospira was significantly higher in introduced compared to endemic species. Lastly, the probability of infection with Leptospira was highest in introduced small mammal species, and lower in forest fragments compared to other habitat types. Our results highlight how human land use affects the small mammal community composition and in turn disease dynamics. Introduced species likely transmit Leptospira to native species where they co-occur, and may displace the Leptospira species naturally occurring in Madagascar. The frequent spatial overlap of people and introduced species likely also has consequences for public health.
   Author summary
   Many neglected tropical diseases have reservoirs in wildlife. The effects of human activities on wildlife include changes in species abundance, community composition, and the transmission dynamics of parasites. Introduced species, especially black rats (Rattus rattus) are known to transmit zoonotic diseases among wildlife species and people. Leptospira, a water-borne bacterium that infects wildlife and people, is an important pathogen in the tropics, and in Madagascar, multiple strains and hosts have been identified. We tested how land use gradients in a forest-frontier agricultural system affect the composition of small mammal communities, and in turn the prevalence of Leptospira. We investigated 11 species of small mammals, including native rodents and tenrecs, as well as introduced rodents and shrews, in old growth forest, forest fragments, agricultural fields, and in a village. Leptospira prevalence and infection risk were highest in introduced species compared to native species and lower in forest fragments. The results highlight how the introduction of non-native species affects the variation in disease prevalence in small mammals, with potential consequences for spill-over to people.

TI  - The microbial diversity and structure in peatland forest in Indonesia
T2  - SOIL USE AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - The microbial community structure and function under forest in tropical peatlands are poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the microbial community structure and diversity in natural peat swamp forest soil, disturbed peat soil and mineral soil in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, using 454 pyrosequencing. The results showed that the natural peat soil had the greatest fungal species richness (Chao1), which was significantly (p < .05) larger than that in the other two soils. Community structure of both fungi and bacteria in natural peat soil differed significantly from that in the disturbed peat soil (p = .039 and p = .045, respectively). Ascomycota (40.5%) was the most abundant phylum across the three soils followed by Basidiomycota (18.8%), Zygomycota (<0.1%) and Glomeromycota (<0.1%). The linear discriminant analysis with effect size (LEfSe) showed that Ascomycota (p < .05) and genus Gliocephalotrichum (p < .05) dominated in natural peat soil. Functionally, pathotrophs were more abundant in disturbed peat soil (p < .05). Proteobacteria (43.8%) were the most abundant phylum followed by Acidobacteria (32.6%), Actinobacteria (9.8%), Planctomycetes (1.7%). Methylocystis, Telmatospirillum, Syntrophobacter, Sorangium and Opitutus were the more abundant genera in disturbed peat soil, whereas Nevskia and Schlesneria were more abundant in mineral soil and natural peat soil, respectively. The natural peat forest soil supported a more diverse microbiology; however, the land use of such a soil can change its microbial community structure. The results provide evidence that the disturbance of tropical peat land could lead to the introduction and spread of a large number of fungal diseases

TI  - The Impact of the 1998 Forest Fire on Ectomycorrhizae of Dipterocarp Trees and their Recovery in Tropical Rain Forests of East Kalimantan, Indonesia
T2  - JARQ-JAPAN AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH QUARTERLY
AB  - The impact of forest fire in 1997 and 1998 oil the mycorrhzae was studied at the dipterocarp forest in East Kalimantan, Indonesia. in unaffected forest more than half of total ectomycorrhizae distributed in the organic layer but in the fire-affected forest one and a half years after the fire, total amount of mycorrhizae was smaller and they were found in deeper soil. The number of morphotypes of mycorhizae was also smaller in fire-affected forest. An artificial plantation established after clear cut and prescribed burn had the largest amount of ectomycorrhizae, but the diversity was smaller than the unaffected forest. After four years, mycorrhizae had not yet recovered in fire-affected forest although the organic layer had recovered. Pioneer species of mycorrhizal fungi (early-stage fungi) developed sporocarps around the surviving hosts in severely affected forest and this suggests the start of secondary succession of mycorrhizae. In moderately affected forest, the species composition of mycorrhizal fungi which fruited during the study was similar to those of unaffected forest. This fact suggests that such sites may be the refugia of symbionts and be important in reforestation.

Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) represent a major health problem as they affect over 1 billion people, especially vulnerable populations living in tropical and subtropical regions. Currently available drugs are generally inadequate for the majority of these diseases, thus, there is an urgent need for new treatments. The present review aims to summarize upto-date and comprehensive information on the efficacy of the Amazon plants, in treating certainneglected tropical diseases. According to the literature information, several compounds (phenolics, alkaloids, terpenoids and steroids, among others) which were isolated from plants of the Amazon forest showed in vtro activity against Leishmania sp., Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasites responsible for leishmaniasis and Chagas disease, respectively. Moreover, extracts and essential oil from certain plants were reported to have mosquito repellent and insecticidal activities against Aedes aegypti, the vector of dengue, and chikungunya. This review demonstrated that the Amazonian rainforest is endowed with pharmacologically active plants which can be used as a starting point for the development of new drugs against NTDs, such as leishmaniasis, Chagas disease, dengue, and chikungunya.

TI  - High-resolution tropical forest mapping of the Amazon basin: a novel classification approach for the GRFM radar mosaic
T2  - IGARSS 2001: SCANNING THE PRESENT AND RESOLVING THE FUTURE, VOLS 1-7, PROCEEDINGS
CP  - IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium
AB  - The high resolution (100 in) Global Rain Forest Mapping (GRFM) radar mosaics, providing a spatially continuous coverage of entire ecosystems, pave the way to improved estimates of bio-physical parameters related to the tropical vegetation. A new classification scheme for producing a high-resolution regional scale forest-non forest thematic map of the Amazon is proposed. First, a new wavelet multi-resolution decomposition/reconstruction technique is employed to generate an edge-preserving piecewise constant approximation of the original radar image. Second, a two-stage hybrid learning Nearest Multiple-Prototype (NMP) classifier is applied to the reconstructed radar image. The NMP first stage employs a near-optimal vector quantization algorithm called Enhanced Linde-Buzo-Gray (ELBG). During the training phase, ELBG employs only 1% of the whole data set. At second stage of NMP, vector prototypes are combined into land cover classes of interest by an expert photo-interpreter. In the pattern recognition phase, each pixel is labeled according to the minimum-distance-to-prototype criterion. Experimental results are reported for a thematic problem involving classes: primary forest, degraded forest, non-forest, and water bodies. Validation is performed using land cover maps provided by the Tropical Rain Forest Information Center (TRIFIC) over three test sites featuring different forest cover disturbance patterns. Main results are that the proposed classifier: i) provides a classification accuracy of 87% in forest/non-forest mapping; ii) is capable of generalizing over the entire data set, and iii) requires minor user interaction. It is concluded that the proposed approach responds adequately to the requirements of regional scale high-resolution vegetation mapping.

TI  - A distinctive avian assemblage (Aves: Passeriformes) in Western Darien, Panama is uncovered through a disease surveillance program
T2  - REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL
AB  - Basic knowledge about the distribution of flora and fauna is lacking for most tropical areas. Improving our knowledge of the tropical biota will help address contemporary global problems, including emerging tropical diseases. Less appreciated is the role that applied studies can have in improving our understanding of basic biological patterns and processes in the tropics. Here, I describe a novel avifauna assemblage uncovered in Western Darien province in the Republic of Panama that was uncovered during a vector-borne disease surveillance program. I compared the passerine bird species composition at 16 sites using records from recent ornithological expeditions sponsored by the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Central and Eastern Panama. Based on the results of a Mantel test, geographic distance did not correlate with pairwise distinctiveness of sites. Instead, based on an index of distinctiveness modified from the Chao-Jaccard index, most sites were more or less similarly distinctive, with one site, Aruza Abajo, significantly more distinctive than the rest. I found that the distinctiveness of this site was due not only to the presence of several rare and range-restricted taxa, but also to the absence of taxa that are common elsewhere. This finding provides more evidence of high species composition turnover (beta-diversity) in the Panamanian biota, which appears to be driven by a combination of soil and climate differences over narrow distances.

TI  - Spatiotemporal modelling of soil moisture in an Atlantic forest through machine learning algorithms
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE
AB  - Understanding the spatiotemporal behaviour of soil moisture in tropical forests is fundamental because it mediates processes such as infiltration, groundwater recharge, runoff and evapotranspiration. This study aims to model the spatiotemporal dynamics of soil moisture in an Atlantic forest remnant (AFR) through four machine learning algorithms, as these dynamics represent an important knowledge gap under tropical conditions. Random forest (RF), support vector machine, average neural network and weighted k-nearest neighbour were studied. The abilities of the models were evaluated by means of root mean square error, mean absolute error, coefficient of determination (R-2) and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NS) for two calibration approaches: (a) chronological and (b) randomized. The models were further compared with a multilinear regression (MLR). The study period spans from September 2012 to November 2019 and relies on variables representing the weather, geographical location, forest structure, soil physics and morphology. RF was the best algorithm for modelling the spatiotemporal dynamics of the soil moisture with an NS of 0.77 and R-2 of 0.51 in the randomized approach. This finding highlights the ability of RF to generalize a dataset with contrasting weather conditions. Kriging maps highlighted the suitability of RF to track the spatial distribution of soil moisture in the AFR. Throughfall (TF), potential evapotranspiration (ETo), longitude (Long), diameter at breast height (DBH) and species diversity (H) were the most important variables controlling soil moisture. MLR performed poorly in modelling the spatiotemporal dynamics of soil moisture due to the highly nonlinear condition of this process.
   Highlights
   Modelling soil moisture in an Atlantic forest through machine learning.
   Machine learning algorithms are powerful tools to address the spatiotemporal dynamics of soil moisture.
   Climate, position and forest variables drive the spatiotemporal pattern of soil moisture.
   Random forest is the best algorithm to simulate soil moisture dynamics.

TI  - SEEDLING CROWN ORIENTATION AND INTERCEPTION OF DIFFUSE-RADIATION IN TROPICAL FOREST GAPS
T2  - ECOLOGY
AB  - In forest gaps, the geometry of canopy openings above a plant determines the spatial distribution of diffuse and direct radiation, which may be received from different sectors of the sky. We examined crown orientation and light interception by seedlings of four species of pioneer trees, Cecropia obtusifolia, Heliocarpus appendiculatus, Piper auritum, and Trema micrantha, transplanted into natural forest gaps at the Los Tuxtlas Tropical Biology Station, Veracruz, Mexico. The four species differed in the number and mean size of leaves, but total leaf area was not significantly different among equal age plants. The mean azimuth and zenith angle of diffuse and direct radiation were determined from hemispherical photographs taken above each plant. Mean diffuse radiation vectors were distributed around the zenith, with a significant clustering in an easterly direction, while mean direct radiation vectors were distributed along the solar track in the southern portion of the sky. The mean orientation of the crown of each seedling was determined from detailed, three-dimensional reconstruction of leaf display using a canopy architecture model. A directional correlation test indicated that seedling crowns were oriented toward diffuse radiation received from the gap, and not toward direct radiation. The mean orientation of the crown, at the whole plant level, was primarily determined by nonrandom orientation of individual leaves. The mechanisms of this differential response to diffuse vs. direct radiation are not known. For diffuse radiation, the total light capture capacity integrated over all sky directions increased with seedling leaf area, while efficiency of capture per unit area decreased. Based on simulations, the light interception efficiency of each plant in its own microsite was 5-25% greater than would be achieved in the sites of conspecifics or in symmetric canopy openings centered on the zenith. These analyses provide a quantitative estimate of the value of nonrandom leaf and crown orientation for whole-plant light interception in natural environments.

TI  - Identifying nudge strategies for behavior-based prevention and control of neglected tropical diseases: a scoping review protocol
T2  - JBI EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS
AB  - Objective: The aim of this scoping review is to synthesize the existing body of studies that use nudge strategy and focus on behavioral practices suitable for prevention and control of neglected tropical diseases. The review will map the existing literature, identify gaps in knowledge, and provide a series of recommendations for future research.
   Introduction: There is a well-established body of knowledge related to "nudging," a strategy that uses subtle stimuli to direct people's behavior within public health interventions, with the aim of changing behaviors to reduce the prevalence of non-communicable diseases. Recently, interventions to promote prevention and control of neglected tropical diseases have included nudging as a strategy for altering behavior. However, these interventions not been synthesized and present the opportunity for a scoping review.
   Inclusion criteria: Eligible studies are those that include nudge strategies aimed at changing behavior to prevent and control neglected tropical diseases. All types of behavioral practices suitable for targeting neglected tropical diseases (e.g. handwashing behaviors) will be considered, not exclusively focusing on a specific type or group of neglected tropical diseases. The nudge strategy must be described in full, without restrictions to the study design. The context or population will be limited to low- and middle-income countries.
   Methods: A comprehensive search will be performed in the following databases: MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Embase (Ovid), Web of Science Core Collection, CINAHL, ERIC, and EconLit (EBSCO), as well as registered trials and reviews in CENTRAL and PROSPERO to identify ongoing or unpublished studies. Titles will be screened by one reviewer, and non-eligible studies excluded. Two reviewers (SB and FVV) will screen abstracts independently. Eligible studies will be selected through a questionnaire that specifies the inclusion criteria. Papers selected for inclusion will be subject to data extraction using a tool designed by one review author and agreed upon by the other review authors. Data will be presented in a table and other conceptual styles.

TI  - Effects of successional status, habit, sexual systems, and pollinators on flowering patterns in tropical rain forest trees
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
AB  - Based on data from observations of 302 tree species at La Selva, Costa Rica, we tested a range of hypotheses about the relationship between flowering parameters such as time, frequency, and duration and ecological features such as successional status, habit, sexual systems, and pollen vectors with and without considering the effect of family membership. We predicted that early successional species would flower any time of the year, but species pollinated by different vectors as well as dioecious species would flower nonrandomly across seasons. However, there was little evidence that flowering time varied with successional status, pollen vectors, and sexual systems. As we predicted, supra-annual flowering was proportionately less common in early successional species as compared to late ones, in understory species as compared to canopy species, and in dioecious species as compared to those with hermaphroditic flowers. When considering phylogeny, however, supra-annual flowering in the understory was not as rare as predicted. Our prediction of longer flowering in the early successional species as compared to late successional species was also supported. Predictions about longer flowering of dioecious species as compared to hermaphroditic species and of species pollinated by generalist vectors as compared to the specialists were not supported, though there was a trend in the expected direction.

TI  - Risk factors analysis for neglected human rickettsioses in rural communities in Nan province, Thailand: A community-based observational study along a landscape gradient
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - In this study, we estimated exposure for Scrub typhus (STG), Typhus (TG) and Spotted fever groups (SFG) rickettsia using serology at a fine scale (a whole sub-district administration level) of local communities in Nan Province, Thailand. Geographical characteristics of the sub-district were divided into two landscape types: lowland agricultural area in an urbanized setting (lowland-urbanized area) and upland agricultural area located close to a protected area of National Park (upland-forested area). This provided an ideal contrast between the two landscapes with low and high levels of human-altered habitats to study in differences in disease ecology. In total, 824 serum samples of participants residing in the eight villages were tested by screening IgG ELISA, and subsequently confirmed by the gold standard IgG Immunofluorescent Assay (IFA). STG and TG IgG positivity were highest with seroprevalence of 9.8% and 9.0%, respectively; whereas SFG positivity rate was lower at 6.9%. Inhabitants from the villages located in upland-forested area demonstrated significantly higher STG exposure, compared to those villages in the lowland-urbanized area (chi-square = 51.97, p < 0.0001). In contrast, TG exposure was significantly higher in those villagers living in lowland-urbanized area (chi-square = 28.26, p < 0.0001). In addition to the effect of landscape types, generalized linear model (GLM) analysis identified socio-demographic parameters, i.e., gender, occupation, age, educational level, domestic animal ownership (dog, cattle and poultry) as influential factors to explain the level of rickettsial exposure (antibody titers) in the communities. Our findings raise the public health awareness of rickettsiosis as a cause of undiagnosed febrile illness in the communities.
   Author summaryEvidence of human exposures to rickettsial pathogens were reported from a cross-sectional study at a whole sub-district scale of local communities in Nan Province, Thailand. Seroprevalence and level of rickettsial exposures demonstrated differences between the habitat types, ecological aspects and socio-demographic factors. In addition, abundance of domestic animals in the community appeared to be one of significant factors influencing levels of human exposure to rickettsial pathogens. Our findings will benefit the local public health by raising awareness of rickettsial infections as one of potential health concerns in the community. Inclusion of rickettsioses in routine laboratory diagnosis would help to differentiate unknown febrile illness and guide appropriate treatment. Further studies are required, particularly in the fields of disease ecology as well as medical and veterinary entomology, in order to better understand epidemiology and potential zoonotic transmission of these neglected rickettsioses in endemic areas.

TI  - Rodents as potential hosts and reservoirs of parasites along the edge of a Central African forest: Bwindi impenetrable national park, South Western Uganda
T2  - AFRICAN HEALTH SCIENCES
AB  - Background: Rodents which constitute 42% of the world's mammalian population are major reservoirs of pathogens that cause zoonoses. Currently we know little about rodents' potential zoonotic transfer from human settlements into protected areas and how any such threats might be reduced. Objective: To investigate the role of rodents as reservoirs of zoonotic pathogens along the boundary of Bwindi.
   Methods: A rodent inventory in three villages along the edge of Bwindi, was carried using live trapping techniques and the local rodents' ecto and endoparasite fauna investigated.
   Results: Two hundred eighty eight rodents captured belonged to 24 species, 17 genera and 4 families with Lophuromys aquilus being most abundant (30.2%). 240 ectoparasites which included mites, fleas and ticks were collected from 88 rodents out of 249. Proamys jacksoni rodents were most infested. Although the mites represented the largest proportion (84.6%), the highest species diversity was shown among the fleas (9 species). Some 36.9% of the rodents were infected with endopara- sites of which L. aquilus haboured most. Endoparasitic genera identified included Nippostrongylus, Ascaris, Strongyloides, Trichuris, Hymenolepis, Taenia and Cryptosporidium. Conclusion: Rodents have a zoonotic potentiality. There is need for developing effective integrated rodent management programs against rodent to reduce chances of parasite transmission within the protected areas.

TI  - Landscape-Level Spatial Patterns of West Nile Virus Risk in the Northern Great Plains
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Understanding the landscape-level determinants of West Nile virus (WNV) can aid in mapping high-risk areas and enhance disease control and prevention efforts. This study analyzed the spatial patterns of human WNV cases in three areas in South Dakota during 2003-2007 and investigated the influences of land cover, hydrology, soils, irrigation, and elevation by using case-control models. Land cover, hydrology, soils, and elevation all influenced WNV risk, although the main drivers were different in each study area. Risk for WNV was generally higher in areas with rural land cover than in developed areas, and higher close to wetlands or soils with a high ponding frequency. In western South Dakota, WNV risk also decreased with increasing elevation and was higher in forested areas. Our results showed that the spatial patterns of human WNV risk were associated with landscape-level features that likely reflect variability in mosquito ecology, avian host communities, and human activity.

TI  - Protecting Life and Lung: Protected Areas Affect Fine Particulate Matter and Respiratory Hospitalizations in the Brazilian Amazon Biome
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL & RESOURCE ECONOMICS
AB  - There is growing recognition of the connection between ecosystem conservation and human health. For example, protection of tropical forests can affect the spread of infectious diseases, water quality, and dietary diversity, while forest loss can have important consequences for respiratory health due to the use of fire for converting land to alternative uses in many countries. Studies demonstrating links between ecosystems and health often conclude with recommendations to expand policies that protect natural ecosystems. However, there is little empirical evidence on the extent to which conservation policies actually deliver health benefits when they are implemented in real contexts. We estimate the effects of protected areas (PAs), the dominant type of conservation policy, on hospitalizations for respiratory illness in the Brazilian Amazon biome. We find that doubling upwind PAs reduces PM2.5 by 10% and respiratory hospitalizations by 7% in the months of most active biomass burning. Brazil has an extensive network of PAs, but investments in management and enforcement have declined in recent years. Forest fires have increased dramatically over the same period. We estimate that the value of the health benefits exceed current average expenditures on PA management for the 1/3 of PAs with the largest local populations, although not for PAs in more remote locations. Our findings highlight how quantifying the contributions to the wellbeing of local populations can support conservation objectives, even if global environmental benefits are not a high priority for decision makers.

TI  - Ranavirus is widespread in Costa Rica and co-occurs with threatened amphibians
T2  - DISEASES OF AQUATIC ORGANISMS
AB  - Amphibians are globally threatened by emerging infectious diseases, and ranaviruses are among the most concerning pathogens to threaten species in the wild. We sampled for ranaviruses in wild amphibians at 8 sites in Costa Rica, spanning broad climatic zones and taxonomic associations. Seven of these sites are inhabited by highly threatened amphibian species that persist at low global population sizes after population declines due to amphibian chytridiomycosis. One of the surveyed sites is occupied by an introduced amphibian species, which is relatively rare in Central America but may be an important pathway for long-distance transport of ranaviruses. We detected ranavirus using quantitative polymerase chain reaction in 16.3 % of the 243 individuals and among 5 of our 8 sites, but not at the site with the introduced species. Infection prevalence varied among species and sites, but not with mean annual temperature or mean annual precipitation. Infection intensity did not vary with species, site, temperature, or precipitation. Our results show that ranavirus infection is spatially widespread in Costa Rica, affecting a broad range of host species, and occurs across climatic zones - though we encountered no mortality or morbidity in our sampled species. Ranaviruses are known to cause intermittent mass mortality in amphibian populations, and the threatened species sampled here are likely vulnerable to population impacts from emerging ranaviruses. Therefore, we believe the potential impacts of ranaviruses on amphibian populations in tropical regions have likely been underestimated, and that they should be viewed as a potential major stressor to threatened amphibians in tropical regions.

TI  - Patterns of leaf-pathogen infection in the understory of a Mexican rain forest:: Incidence, spatiotemporal variation, and mechanisms of infection
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
AB  - This study assessed the levels of damage by leaf pathogens and their variability in terms of host species, space (four mature forest sites) and season of the year (dry and rainy), and the mechanisms of infection in the understory of the Los Tuxtlas tropical rain forcer. Sixty-five percent of the species surveyed in the dry season (N = 49) and 64.9% of those surveyed in the rainy season (N = 57) were damaged by fungi. Leaf area damaged per plant. on average, was <1% (range: 0.25-20.52%). There was considerable variation in the degree of infection among species. but not among sites and seasons. The survey showed that 43% of the leaves were damaged by herbivores and pathogens concurrently, 16% showed damage by insect herbivory alone, and only 1.4% of the sampled leaves showed damage by pathogens alone. Pathogenicity assays experimentally confirmed that the predominant mechanism of fungal establishment was wounding, such as that caused by herbivory (or other similar sources), and only rarely did infection occur through direct contact (without wounds). The results revealed the omnipresence of leaf fungal infection, although with low damage per plant. and the importance of herbivorous insects in the facilitation of fungal infection in tropical understory plants.

TI  - Disease-Driven Amphibian Declines Alter Ecosystem Processes in a Tropical Stream
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
AB  - Predicting the ecological consequences of declining biodiversity is an urgent challenge, particularly in freshwater habitats where species declines and losses are among the highest. Small-scale experiments suggest potential ecosystem responses to losses of species, but definitive conclusions require verification at larger scales. We measured ecosystem metabolism and used whole-ecosystem stable isotope tracer additions to quantify nitrogen cycling in a tropical headwater stream before and after the sudden loss of amphibians to the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. Tadpoles are normally dominant grazers in such streams, where greater than 18 species may co-occur and densities often exceed 50 individuals m(-2). Loss of 98% of tadpole biomass corresponded with greater than 2x increases in algae and fine detritus biomass in the stream and a greater than 50% reduction in nitrogen uptake rate. Nitrogen turnover rates in suspended and deposited organic sediments were also significantly lower after the decline. As a consequence, the stream cycled nitrogen less rapidly, and downstream exports of particulate N were reduced. Whole stream respiration was significantly lower following the decline, indicating less biological activity in the stream sediments. Contrary to our predictions, biomass of grazing invertebrates, or any invertebrate functional groups, did not increase over 2 years following loss of tadpoles. Thus, reductions in ecosystem processes linked to the amphibian decline were not compensated for by other, functionally redundant consumers. Declining animal biodiversity has ecosystem-level consequences that may not be offset by ecological redundancy, even in biologically diverse regions such as the Neotropics.

TI  - Antimicrobial and antiviral activities of an actinomycete (<i>Streptomyces</i> sp.) isolated from a Brazilian tropical forest soil
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB  - A promising producer of bioactive compounds isolated from a Brazilian tropical soil was tested for its range of antimicrobial activities. Strain 606, classified as Streptomyces sp., could not be identified up to species level, suggesting a possible new taxon. The supernatant and 10 extracts and fractions, obtained by extraction and chromatographic techniques, presented antimicrobial activity using antibiograms. The methanolic fraction was highly active against pathogenic bacteria, phytopathogenic fungi and the human pathogenic yeast Candida albicans. It also possessed high antiviral activity inhibiting the propagation of an acyclovir-resistant herpes simplex virus type 1 strain on HEp-2 cells at non-cytotoxic concentration. The strong cytotoxic effect suggests an antitumour action.

TI  - Searching for putative avian malaria vectors in a Seasonally Dry Tropical Forest in Brazil
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
AB  - Background: Haemosporidian parasites of the genera Plasmodium and Haemoproteus can have detrimental effects on individual birds and populations. Despite recent investigations into the distribution and richness of these parasites and their vertebrate hosts, little is known about their dipteran vectors. The Neotropics has the highest diversity of mosquitoes in the world, but few studies have tried to identify vectors in this area, hampering the understanding of the ecology of avian malaria in the highly diverse Neotropical environments. Methods: Shannon traps and active collection were used to capture 27,110 mosquitoes in a Seasonally Dry Tropical Forest in southeastern Brazil, a highly endangered ecosystem.
   Results: We screened 17,619 mosquito abdomens from 12 different species and several unidentified specimens of Culex, grouped into 1,913 pools, for the presence of haemosporidians. Two pools (out of 459) of the mosquito Mansonia titillans and one pool (out of 29) of Mansonia pseudotitillans were positive for Plasmodium parasites, with the detection of a new parasite lineage in the former species. Detected Plasmodium lineages were distributed in three different clades within the phylogenetic tree revealing that Mansonia mosquitoes are potential vectors of genetically distant parasites. Two pools of Culex spp. (out of 43) were positive for Plasmodium gallinaceum and closely related lineages. We found a higher abundance of these putative vectors in pasture areas, but they were also distributed in areas at intermediate and late successional stages. One pool of the mosquito Psorophora discrucians (out of 173) was positive for Haemoproteus.
   Conclusions: The occurrence of different Plasmodium lineages in Mansonia mosquitoes indicates that this genus encompasses potential vectors of avian malaria parasites in Brazil, even though we did not find positive thoraces among the samples tested. Additional evidence is required to assign the role of Mansonia mosquitoes in avian malaria transmission and further studies will add information about evolutionary and ecological aspects of avian haemosporidia and untangle the diversity of their vectors in Brazil.

TI  - Blood feeding patterns of mosquitoes: random or structured?
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ZOOLOGY
AB  - Background: The foraging behavior of blood-sucking arthropods is the defining biological event shaping the transmission cycle of vector-borne parasites. It is also a phenomenon that pertains to the realm of community ecology, since blood-feeding patterns of vectors can occur across a community of vertebrate hosts. Although great advances in knowledge of the genetic basis for blood-feeding choices have been reported for selected vector species, little is known about the role of community composition of vertebrate hosts in determining such patterns.
   Methods & Results: Here, we present an analysis of feeding patterns of vectors across a variety of locations, looking at foraging patterns of communities of mosquitoes, across communities of hosts primarily comprised of mammals and birds. Using null models of species co-occurrence, which do not require ancillary information about host abundance, we found that blood-feeding patterns were aggregated in studies from multiple sites, but random in studies from a single site. This combination of results supports the idea that mosquito species in a community may rely primarily on host availability in a given landscape, and that contacts with specific hosts will be influenced more by the presence/absence of hosts than by innate mosquito choices. This observation stresses the importance of blood-feeding plasticity as a key trait explaining the emergence of many zoonotic mosquito transmitted diseases.
   Discussion: From an epidemiological perspective our observations support the idea that phenomena promoting synchronization of vectors and hosts can promote the emergence of vector-borne zoonotic diseases, as suggested by observations on the linkages between deforestation and the emergence of several human diseases.

TI  - Machine Learning Approaches for Detecting Tropical Cyclone Formation Using Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - This study compared detection skill for tropical cyclone (TC) formation using models based on three different machine learning (ML) algorithms-decision trees (DT), random forest (RF), and support vector machines (SVM)-and a model based on Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). Eight predictors were derived from WindSat satellite measurements of ocean surface wind and precipitation over the western North Pacific for 2005-2009. All of the ML approaches performed better with significantly higher hit rates ranging from 94 to 96% compared with LDA performance (77%), although false alarm rate by MLs is slightly higher (21-28%) than that by LDA (13%). Besides, MLs could detect TC formation at the time as early as 26-30 h before the first time diagnosed as tropical depression by the JTWC best track, which was also 5 to 9 h earlier than that by LDA. The skill differences across MLs were relatively smaller than difference between MLs and LDA. Large yearly variation in forecast lead time was common in all models due to the limitation in sampling from orbiting satellite. This study highlights that ML approaches provide an improved skill for detecting TC formation compared with conventional linear approaches.

TI  - Vertical stratification of adult mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) within a tropical rainforest in Sabah, Malaysia
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
AB  - Background: Malaria cases caused by Plasmodium knowlesi, a simian parasite naturally found in long-tailed and pig-tailed macaques, are increasing rapidly in Sabah, Malaysia. One hypothesis is that this increase is associated with changes in land use. A study was carried out to identify the anopheline vectors present in different forest types and to observe the human landing behaviour of mosquitoes.
   Methods: Mosquito collections were carried out using human landing catches at ground and canopy levels in the Tawau Division of Sabah. Collections were conducted along an anthropogenic disturbance gradient (primary forest, lightly logged virgin jungle reserve and salvage logged forest) between 18:00 and 22:00 h.
   Results: Anopheles balabacensis, a vector of P. knowlesi, was the predominant species in all collection areas, accounting for 70 % of the total catch, with a peak landing time of 18:30-20:00 h. Anopheles balabacensis had a preference for landing on humans at ground level compared to the canopy (p < 0.0001). A greater abundance of mosquitoes were landing in the logged forest compared to the primary forest (p < 0.0001). There was no difference between mosquito abundance in the logged forest and lightly logged forest (p = 0.554). A higher evening temperature (p < 0.0001) and rainfall (p < 0.0001) significantly decreased mosquito abundance during collection nights.
   Conclusions: This study demonstrates the potential ability of An. balabacensis to transmit P. knowlesi between canopy-dwelling simian hosts and ground-dwelling humans, and that forest disturbance increases the abundance of this disease vector. These results, in combination with regional patterns of land use change, may partly explain the rapid rise in P. knowlesi cases in Sabah. This study provides essential data on anthropophily for the principal vector of P. knowlesi which is important for the planning of vector control strategies.

TI  - Climatic variability and landscape heterogeneity impact urban mosquito diversity and vector abundance and infection
T2  - ECOSPHERE
AB  - Urban habitat heterogeneity can modify interactions across species and lead to spatially fine grained differences in beta-diversity patterns and their associated ecosystem services. Here, we study the impacts of landscape heterogeneity and climatic variability on: (1) the richness and diversity patterns of mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) and (2) the abundance and West Nile virus infection rate of the house mosquito, Culex pipiens, in Chicago, USA. We conducted a four year long study (2005-2008) in 8 sites that captured a gradient of urban heterogeneities. We found a total of 19 mosquito species, a representative sample of mosquito species richness in the area, according to both model estimation (Chao2 +/- S. E. = 20.50 +/- 2.29) and faunal records for Chicago. We found that heterogeneity in the landscape was the best predictor of both mosquito species richness and diversity, with the most heterogeneous landscapes harboring the largest number of species. In general there were no changes in species richness over the years that could be associated with weather patterns and climatic variability (WPCV). In contrast, changes in diversity were associated with WPCV. Our results also showed that WPCV had major impacts on house mosquito abundance and West Nile virus mosquito infection rate (MIR) patterns. Although MIR was independent of mosquito diversity, it was associated with overall mosquito abundance, which had a convex association with species richness (i.e., abundance increases to a point after which it decreases as function of species richness). Finally, our results highlight the importance of considering dominant vector species as part of a community of vectors, whose biodiversity patterns can directly or indirectly impact the risk of infectious disease transmission.

TI  - The drivers of avian-haemosporidian prevalence in tropical lowland forests of New Guinea in three dimensions
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB  - Haemosporidians are among the most common parasites of birds and often negatively impact host fitness. A multitude of biotic and abiotic factors influence these associations, but the magnitude of these factors can differ by spatial scales (i.e., local, regional and global). Consequently, to better understand global and regional drivers of avian-haemosporidian associations, it is key to investigate these associations at smaller (local) spatial scales. Thus, here, we explore the effect of abiotic variables (e.g., temperature, forest structure, and anthropogenic disturbances) on haemosporidian prevalence and host-parasite networks on a horizontal spatial scale, comparing four fragmented forests and five localities within a continuous forest in Papua New Guinea. Additionally, we investigate if prevalence and host-parasite networks differ between the canopy and the understory (vertical stratification) in one forest patch. We found that the majority of Haemosporidian infections were caused by the genus Haemoproteus and that avian-haemosporidian networks were more specialized in continuous forests. At the community level, only forest greenness was negatively associated with Haemoproteus infections, while the effects of abiotic variables on parasite prevalence differed between bird species. Haemoproteus prevalence levels were significantly higher in the canopy, and an opposite trend was observed for Plasmodium. This implies that birds experience distinct parasite pressures depending on the stratum they inhabit, likely driven by vector community differences. These three-dimensional spatial analyses of avian-haemosporidians at horizontal and vertical scales suggest that the effect of abiotic variables on haemosporidian infections are species specific, so that factors influencing community-level infections are primarily driven by host community composition.

TI  - Adenoviral Vectors as Vaccines for Emerging Avian Influenza Viruses
T2  - FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
AB  - It is evident that the emergence of infectious diseases, which have the potential for spillover from animal reservoirs, pose an ongoing threat to global health. Zoonotic transmission events have increased in frequency in recent decades due to changes in human behavior, including increased international travel, the wildlife trade, deforestation, and the intensification of farming practices to meet demand for meat consumption. Influenza A viruses (IAV) possess a number of features which make them a pandemic threat and a major concern for human health. Their segmented genome and error-prone process of replication can lead to the emergence of novel reassortant viruses, for which the human population are immunologically naive. In addition, the ability for IAVs to infect aquatic birds and domestic animals, as well as humans, increases the likelihood for reassortment and the subsequent emergence of novel viruses. Sporadic spillover events in the past few decades have resulted in human infections with highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses, with high mortality. The application of conventional vaccine platforms used for the prevention of seasonal influenza viruses, such as inactivated influenza vaccines (IIVs) or live-attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIVs), in the development of vaccines for HPAI viruses is fraught with challenges. These issues are associated with manufacturing under enhanced biosafety containment, and difficulties in propagating HPAI viruses in embryonated eggs, due to their propensity for lethality in eggs. Overcoming manufacturing hurdles through the use of safer backbones, such as low pathogenicity avian influenza viruses (LPAI), can also be a challenge if incompatible with master strain viruses. Non-replicating adenoviral (Ad) vectors offer a number of advantages for the development of vaccines against HPAI viruses. Their genome is stable and permits the insertion of HPAI virus antigens (Ag), which are expressed in vivo following vaccination. Therefore, their manufacture does not require enhanced biosafety facilities or procedures and is egg-independent. Importantly, Ad vaccines have an exemplary safety and immunogenicity profile in numerous human clinical trials, and can be thermostabilized for stockpiling and pandemic preparedness. This review will discuss the status of Ad-based vaccines designed to protect against avian influenza viruses with pandemic potential.

TI  - Making dispersal syndromes and networks useful in tropical conservation and restoration
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - Dispersal syndromes and networks must be used cautiously in conserving and restoring seed-dispersal processes. In many tropical forests most tree and shrub species require dispersal by animals for local persistence and for migration in response to environmental change. The most important errors to avoid in practical use of both dispersal syndromes (suites of fruit and seed characteristics that attract different dispersal agents) and network modules (groups of interacting dispersal agents and plants bearing fruits or seeds that they eat) are: (1) assuming that use of fruit resources by fruit-eating animals implies effective seed dispersal; (2) assuming that superficially similar fruits imply equally effective dispersal by similar animals, and (3) assuming that fruit resources at issue support animal populations. This essay explores strengths and weaknesses of uses of dispersal syndromes and disperser networks modules in conservation and restoration. Examples include some that are consistent with expectations from syndrome categorization and some that are not. An unappreciated weakness in using either dispersal syndromes or network modules is that contingent foraging by animals in highly disturbed habitats, now comprising 60%-70% of tropical land biomes, may not resemble foraging choices or consequences in protected closed forests, where most research on tropical seed dispersal is done. General prescriptions for the future include maintaining or creating habitat heterogeneity in largely deforested landscapes where remnant closed forests still exist, and active restoration in landscapes where little heterogeneity remains. In both cases, adaptations of multiple frame-work tree approaches have the best chance of preserving or enhancing populations of animal-dispersed trees and their seed vectors, and in opening migration paths in response to climate change.

TI  - Public-Private Partnerships and the Landscape of Neglected Tropical Disease Research: The Shifting Logic and Spaces of Knowledge Production
T2  - MINERVA
AB  - Until the recent spread of public-private partnerships, pharmaceutical firms had avoided research and development into neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). Because these are diseases that affect the poorest populations in developing regions, research and development initiatives have for the most part depended on the resources and expertise drawn from academia, international organizations, and intermittent state interventions in disease-endemic countries. Over the last few decades, however, public-private product development partnerships (PDPs) have been introducing new collaborative agreements in which the existing resources and expertise combine with the those traditionally withheld by the pharmaceutical industry and global health NGOs. This paper explores recent transformations in the representation of NTDs by examining the shifting logic and spaces of knowledge production which the advent of PDPs has enabled. An analysis of two case studies focused on Chagas disease-related initiatives addresses recurring preoccupations in Science, Technology and Society studies as well as in critical analyses of PDPs: that is, the back-and-forth movement of the disease from being an object of scientific inquiry to a public health concern, and the legitimacy risks and material asymmetries entailed in global health PDPs. Both cases show that it is major global health stakeholders and experts in non-endemic countries, rather than transnational pharmaceutical firms, that exert the greatest influence upon these changing representations: PDPs attempt to expand the preexisting biomedical focus on NTDs by means of incorporating "real world" drug development preoccupations (which I term epistemic shifts), but they also combine their stated global humanitarian aim with security concerns about the diseases spreading to non-endemic, industrialized countries (which I term geographical shifts).

TI  - Mining increases the prevalence of avian haemosporidian parasites in Northeast Amazonia
T2  - PARASITOLOGY RESEARCH
AB  - Studies contrasting parasite prevalence and host-parasite community structure between pristine and disturbed environments will improve our understanding of how deforestation affects disease transmission and parasite extinction. To determine how infection rates of a common and diverse group of avian blood parasites (Plasmodium and Haemoproteus) respond to changes in avian host composition after mining, we surveyed 25 bird communities from pristine forests (two forest types: plateau and hillside) and reforested sites in Northeast Amazonia. Infection rates and both parasite and avian host community structure exhibited considerable variation across the deforestation gradient. In opposition to the emerging pattern of lower avian haemosporidian prevalence in disturbed tropical forests in Africa, we show that secondary forests had higher haemosporidian prevalence in one of the largest mining areas of Amazonia. The dissimilarity displayed by bird communities may explain, in part, the higher prevalence of Haemoproteus in reforested areas owing to the tolerance of some bird species to open-canopy forest habitat. On the other hand, deforestation may cause local extinction of Plasmodium parasites due to the loss of their avian hosts that depend on closed-canopy primary forest habitats. Our results demonstrate that forest loss induced by anthropogenic changes can affect a host-parasite system and disturb both parasite transmission and diversity.

TI  - Guild-level responses of bats to habitat conversion in a lowland Amazonian rainforest: species composition and biodiversity
T2  - JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY
AB  - Landscape modification represents one of the most severe threats to biodiversity from local to global scales. Conversion of forest to agricultural production generally results in patches of habitat that subdivide or isolate populations, alter the behavior of species, modify interspecific interactions, reduce biodiversity, and compromise ecosystem processes. Moreover, conversion may increase exposure of humans to zoonoses to which they would otherwise rarely be exposed. We evaluated the effects of forest conversion to agriculture, and its subsequent successional dynamics, on bat communities in a region of the Amazon that was predominantly closed-canopy rainforest. Based on a nonmanipulative experiment, we quantified differences in species composition, community structure, and taxonomic biodiversity among closed-canopy forest (bosque), agricultural lands (chacra), and secondary forest (purma) for two phyllostomid guilds (frugivores and gleaning animalivores) during the wet and dry seasons. Responses were complex and guild-specific. For frugivores, species composition (species abundance distributions) differed between all possible pairs of habitats in both wet and dry seasons. For gleaning animalivores, species composition differed between all possible pairs of habitats in the dry season, but no differences characterized the wet season. Ecological structure (rank abundance distributions) differed among habitats in guild-specific and season-specific manners. For frugivores, mean diversity, evenness, and dominance were greater in bosque than in purma; mean dominance was greater in bosque than in chacra, but local rarity was greater in chacra than in bosque, and no differences were manifest between purma and chacra. For gleaning animalivores, mean diversity and evenness were greater in bosque than in purma, but no differences were manifest between chacra and bosque, or between purma and chacra. Such results have important implications for management, conservation, and the epidemiology of zoonotic diseases.

TI  - Effects of microclimatic changes caused by deforestation on the survivorship and reproductive fitness of <i>Anopheles gambiae</i> in Western Kenya highlands
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Land use changes have been suggested as one of the causes for malaria epidemics in the African highlands. This study investigated the effects of deforestation-induced changes in indoor temperature on the survivorship and reproductive fitness of Anopheles gambiae in an epidemic prone area in the western Kenya highlands. We found that the mean indoor temperatures of houses located in the deforested area were 1.2 degrees C higher than in houses located in the forested area during the dry season and 0.7 degrees C higher during the rainy season. The mosquito mortality rate was highly age-dependent regardless of study site or season. Mosquitoes that were placed in houses in the deforested area showed a 64.8-79.5% higher fecundity than those in houses located in the forested area, but the median survival time was reduced by 5-7 days. Female mosquitoes in the deforested area showed a 38.5-40.6% increase in net reproductive rate and an 11.6-42.9% increase in intrinsic growth rate than those in the forested area. Significant increases in net reproductive rate and intrinsic growth rate for mosquitoes in the deforested area suggest that deforestation enhances mosquito reproductive fitness, increasing mosquito population growth potential in the western Kenya highlands. The vectorial capacity of An. gambiae under study was estimated at least 106% and 29% higher in the deforested area than in the forested area in dry and rainy seasons, respectively.

TI  - Development of pedotransfer functions for water retention in tropical mountain soil landscapes: spotlight on parameter tuning in machine learning
T2  - SOIL
AB  - Machine-learning algorithms are good at computing non-linear problems and fitting complex composite functions, which makes them an adequate tool for addressing multiple environmental research questions. One important application is the development of pedotransfer functions (PTFs). This study aims to develop water retention PTFs for two remote tropical mountain regions with rather different soil landscapes: (1) those dominated by peat soils and soils under volcanic influence with high organic matter contents and (2) those dominated by tropical mineral soils. Two tuning procedures were compared to fit boosted regression tree models: (1) tuning with grid search, which is the standard approach in pedometrics; and (2) tuning with differential evolution optimization. A nested cross-validation approach was applied to generate robust models. The area-specific PTFs developed outperform other more general PTFs. Furthermore, the first PTF for typical soils of Paramo landscapes (Ecuador), i.e., organic soils under volcanic influence, is presented. Overall, the results confirmed the differential evolution algorithm's high potential for tuning machine-learning models. While models based on tuning with grid search roughly predicted the response variables' mean for both areas, models applying the differential evolution algorithm for parameter tuning explained up to 25 times more of the response variables' variance.

TI  - Abundance of the common vampire bat and feeding prevalence on cattle along a gradient of landscape disturbance in southeastern Mexico
T2  - MAMMAL RESEARCH
AB  - Cattle ranching is one of the main production activities in the Neotropics that has unavoidably led to cattle exposure to the common vampire bat (Desmodus rotundus) and rabies virus. Although many studies have assessed this issue, the influence of environmental characteristics associated with land use and social and production constraints have received little attention. We used satellite imagery classification to identify a gradient of landscape disturbance and analyzed the effects of cattle management and landscape structure on common vampire bat abundance and feeding prevalence. Evidence of the common vampire bat feeding on cattle was common in the study area: 87.5% of the ranchers interviewed claimed to have experienced this problem. The abundance and feeding prevalence of the common vampire bat was lower in landscapes dominated by open fields, scarce forest cover, and agricultural land. Bat abundance was positively associated with the presence of streams in the proximity of grazing areas, whereas cave's presence was associated with higher feeding prevalence. We suggest that cattle grazing should avoid the proximity of streams, caves, and forests as much as possible, as these conditions increase the exposure of cattle to the common vampire bat and the potential for feeding, which can increase the likelihood of rabies virus transmission.

AB  - Nipah virus has caused recurring outbreaks in central and northwest Bangladesh (the "Nipah Belt"). Little is known about roosting behavior of the fruit bat reservoir, Pteropus giganteus, or factors driving spillover. We compared human population density and ecological characteristics of case villages and control villages (no reported outbreaks) to understand their role in P. giganteus. roosting ecology and Nipah virus spillover risk. Nipah Belt villages have a higher human population density (P < 0.0001), and forests that are more fragmented than elsewhere in Bangladesh (0.50 versus 0.32 patches/km(2), P < 0.0001). The number of roosts in a village correlates with forest fragmentation (r = 0.22, P = 0.03). Villages with a roost containing Polyahhia longifolia or Bombax ceiba trees were more likely case villages (odds ratio [OR] = 10.8, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.3-90.6). This study suggests that, in addition to human population density, composition and structure of the landscape shared by P. giganteus and humans may influence the geographic distribution of Nipah virus spillovers.

TI  - Exploring parameter selection for carbon monitoring based on Landsat-8 imagery of the aboveground forest biomass on Mount Tai
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Forests play a fundamental role in stabilizing the global climate. Aboveground biomass (AGB) is important to the global carbon balance and environmental protection. Remotely sensed features such as single-band information, vegetation indices, texture features and terrain factors have been assessed to accurately estimate the forest biomass. A feature selection SVM-RFE (support vector machine recursive feature elimination) method is proposed to explore the relationship between the biomass and parameters derived from the Mount Tai area Landsat-8 imagery, thereby improving the AGB estimation accuracy. The least significant parameter is recursively removed according to a scoring function to determine the optimal subset of parameters. The performance of the SVM-RFE algorithm biomass feature selection method is then compared with the widely used stepwise regression method. The results show that the SVM-RFE method is superior to the stepwise linear regression method. And it could accurately estimate the AGB compared with field measurements in the context of the recent reducing emissions from forest deforestation and degradation (REDD) mechanism adopted by the United Nations.

TI  - Dengue Infection in Neotropical Forest Mammals
T2  - VECTOR-BORNE AND ZOONOTIC DISEASES
AB  - In South America, dengue is the arbovirus-transmitted disease with the highest incidence. Unlike other arboviruses, wild mammals have no confirmed role in the cycle of dengue in the neotropics, although serological studies have suggested a possible secondary amplification cycle involving mammals other than nonhuman primates. In French Guiana, where all four serotypes (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, DENV-4) are present, the disease is endemic with outbreak events. To determine whether wild mammals can be infected by DENV, rodents, marsupials, and bats were captured over several periods, from 2001 to 2007, at two sites. The first location is a secondary forest surrounded by an urban area where dengue is endemic. The second location is a forest edge site where the disease has not yet emerged. A total of 10,000 trap-nights were performed and 616 mammals were captured. RNAs representing the four DENV serotypes were detected at both sites by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in the livers and/or sera of 92 mammals belonging to 14 out of 32 species distributed among all the orders investigated: Rodentia (33 positive/146 tested), Marsupialia (40/318), and Chiroptera (19/152). Sequence analyses of a portion of the capsid and premembrane junction revealed that mammal strains of DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4 had only 92.6%, 89%, 95%, and 95.8% identity, respectively, with strains circulating in the human population during the same periods. Regarding DENV-2, strains related (99% identity) to those responsible for an epidemic event in humans in French Guiana concurrent to the capture sessions were also evidenced, suggesting that wild mammals in edge habitats can be infected by circulating human strains. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, that neotropical wild mammals can be infected with dengue virus. The question of whether mammals maintain DENV in enzootic cycles and can play a role in its reemergence in human populations remains to be answered.

TI  - Reducing the effects of vegetation phenology on change detection in tropical seasonal biomes
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Tropical seasonal biomes (TSBs), such as the savannas (Cerrado) and semi-arid woodlands (Caatinga) of Brazil, are vulnerable ecosystems to human-induced disturbances. Remote sensing can detect disturbances such as deforestation and fires, but the analysis of change detection in TSBs is affected by seasonal modifications in vegetation indices due to phenology. To reduce the effects of vegetation phenology on changes caused by deforestation and fires, we developed a novel object-based change detection method. The approach combines both the spatial and spectral domains of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), using a pair of Operational Land Imager (OLI)/Landsat-8 images acquired in 2015 and 2016. We used semivariogram indices (SIs) as spatial features and descriptive statistics as spectral features (SFs). We tested the performance of the method using three machine-learning algorithms: support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN) and random forest (RF). The results showed that the combination of spatial and spectral information improved change detection by correctly classifying areas with seasonal changes in NDVI caused by vegetation phenology and areas with NDVI changes caused by human-induced disturbances. The use of semivariogram indices reduced the effects of vegetation phenology on change detection. The performance of the classifiers was generally comparable, but the SVM presented the highest overall classification accuracy (92.27%) when using the hybrid set of NDVI-derived spectral-spatial features. From the vegetated areas, 18.71% of changes were caused by human-induced disturbances between 2015 and 2016. The method is particularly useful for TSBs where vegetation exhibits strong seasonality and regularly spaced time series of satellite images are difficult to obtain due to persistent cloud cover.

TI  - Where boundaries become bridges: Mosquito community composition, key vectors, and environmental associations at forest edges in the central Brazilian Amazon
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Risk of spillover and spillback of mosquito-borne viruses in the neotropics, including yellow fever, dengue, Zika (Flaviviridae: Flavivirus), chikungunya, and Mayaro (Togaviridae: Alphavirus) viruses, is highest at ecotones where humans, monkeys, and mosquitoes coexist. With a view to identifying potential bridge vectors, we investigated changes in mosquito community composition and environmental variables at ground level at distances of 0, 500, 1000, and 2000 m from the edge of a rainforest reserve bordering the city of Manaus in the central Brazilian Amazon. During two rainy seasons in 2019 and 2020, we sampled 9,467 mosquitoes at 244 unique sites using BG-Sentinel traps, hand-nets, and Prokopack aspirators. Species richness and diversity were generally higher at 0 m and 500 m than at 1000 m and 2000 m, while mosquito community composition changed considerably between the forest edge and 500 m before stabilizing by 1000 m. Shifts in environmental variables mainly occurred between the edge and 500 m, and the occurrence of key taxa (Aedes albopictus, Ae. scapularis, Limatus durhamii, Psorophora amazonica, Haemagogus, and Sabethes) was associated with one or more of these variables. Sites where Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus were detected had significantly higher surrounding mean NDBI (Normalized Difference Built-up Index) values than sites where they were not detected, while the opposite was true for Sabethes mosquitoes. Our findings suggest that major changes in mosquito communities and environmental variables occur within 500 m of the forest edge, where there is high risk for contact with both urban and sylvatic vectors. By 1000 m, conditions stabilize, species diversity decreases, and forest mosquitoes predominate. Environmental variables associated with the occurrence of key taxa may be leveraged to characterize suitable habitat and refine risk models for pathogen spillover and spillback.
   Author summaryMosquito-borne viruses, including yellow fever, dengue, Zika, chikungunya, and Mayaro viruses, derive from sylvatic transmission cycles involving forest mosquitoes and wild animals. Occasionally, these sylvatic viruses spill over into humans, which can lead to limited disease outbreaks or sustained human transmission by urban mosquitoes. When translocated by humans to new geographic regions, these viruses have potential to spill back into novel sylvatic cycles, creating a lasting threat to human health. Ecotones, such as forest edges, where humans, mosquitoes, and monkeys coexist, are at high risk of spillover and spillback. We investigated changes in mosquito community composition at incremental distances up to 2000 m into rainforest bordering the Amazonian city of Manaus, where the above viruses circulate in urban and sylvatic cycles. We also characterized mosquito habitat and analyzed associations between key vector species and environmental variables like temperature and vegetation. Our results show that mosquito communities and environmental variables change abruptly within 500 m of the forest edge, where there is high risk for contact of both monkeys and humans with both urban and forest mosquitoes. By 1000 m, conditions stabilize, and forest mosquitoes predominate. Environmental variables associated with the presence of particular mosquito taxa will help characterize suitable habitat for key vector species and refine spillover and spillback risk models for these viruses.

TI  - Leaf decomposition and flammability are largely decoupled across species in a tropical swamp forest despite sharing some predictive leaf functional traits
T2  - NEW PHYTOLOGIST
AB  - center dot Decomposition and fire are major carbon pathways in many ecosystems, yet potential lin-kages between these processes are poorly understood. We test whether variability in decom-posability and flammability across species are related to each other and to key plant functional traits in tropical swamp forests, where habitat degradation is elevating decomposition and fire regimes.center dot Using senesced and fresh leaves of 22 swamp tree species in Singapore, we conducted an in situ decomposition experiment and a laboratory flammability experiment. We analysed 16 leaf physical and biochemical traits as predictors of decomposability and components of flammability: combustibility, ignitability and sustainability.center dot Decomposability and flammability were largely decoupled across species, despite some shared predictive traits such as specific leaf area (SLA). Physical traits predicted that thicker leaves with a smaller SLA and volume decomposed faster, while various cation concentrations predicted flammability components, particularly ignitability.center dot We show that flammability and decomposability of swamp forest leaves are decoupled because flammability is mostly driven by biochemical traits, while decomposition is driven by physical traits. Our approach identifies species that are slow to decompose and burn (e.g. Calophyllum tetrapterum and Xanthophyllum flavescens), which could be planted to mitigate carbon losses in tropical swamp reforestation.

TI  - Neglected Tropical Diseases and Equity in the Post-2015 Health Agenda
T2  - IDS BULLETIN-INSTITUTE OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
AB  - The Millennium Development Goals' focus on just three infectious diseases (HIV/AIDS, malaria, and belatedly, tuberculosis) configured the global health funding landscape for 15 years. neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), a group of 17 or so diseases that disproportionately afflict the world's 'bottom billion', are a symbol of global health inequities, in terms of prioritisation, research attention, and treatment. This article traces efforts to include NTDs in the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) agenda and, having achieved that goal, lobby for an influential position in the post-2015 aid agenda. The SDGs herald a shift to a more expansive approach and there is a risk that NTDs will once again be left behind, lost in a panoply of new goals and targets. There is, however, an opportunity for NTDs to lever their 'neglect' and be recast as a tool of accountability, acting as both a target for and proxy indicator of health equity for the SDGs.

TI  - The role of monkeys, mosquitoes, and humans in the occurrence of a yellow fever outbreak in a fragmented landscape in south Brazil: protecting howler monkeys is a matter of public health
T2  - TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE
AB  - A recent (2008-2009) outbreak of sylvatic yellow fever caused the death of seven people and over 2,000 howler monkeys (black-and-gold, Alouatta caraya, and brown, A. guariba clamitans) in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, spreading panic among the population. The fear of the disease and the misinformation about its relationship with howler monkeys led inhabitants of several regions to exterminate these primates from the forests near their homes. In this paper we describe the theoretical background supporting the idea that howler monkeys play an important role in fighting yellow fever via the surveillance of virus circulation and stress that they are not responsible for the re-emergence of this African infectious disease, its transmission, or its fast spread through the highly fragmented landscape of the state of Rio Grande do Sul. We also describe how this scientific information has been used in the campaign "Protect our Guardian Angels" that was launched to inform the public and the media about the actual relationship of these regionally threatened species to the disease. The campaign is run and supported by educational, scientific, governmental (health- and environment-related) and religious institutions, and NGOs, an alliance in favor of biodiversity conservation and public health that has been effective in changing the quality of the news media, but that still requires a great effort to achieve the necessary level of population awareness.

TI  - Impact of habitat degradation on Phlebotominae (Diptera: Psychodidae) of tropical dry forests in northern Colombia
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - We examined changes in the phlebotomine fauna resulting from human intervention in a tropical dry forest of Northern Colombia where visceral and cutaneous leishmaniases are endemic. A natural forest reserve (Coloso) and a highly degraded area (San Andres de Sotavento [SAS]) were sampled monthly for 8 mo using Shannon traps, sticky traps, and resting-site collections. Overall abundances were higher in Coloso (15,988) than in SAS (2,324), and species richness of phlebotomines was greater in the forest reserve (11 species) than in the degraded habitat (seven species). Fisher alpha, a measure of diversity, reinforced this trend. Both sand fly communities were dominated by Lutzomyia evansi (Nuoez-Tovar), vector of Leishmania chagasi (Cunha & Chagas), representing 92 and 81% of all captures in Coloso and SAS, respectively. Lutzomyia longipalpis (Lutz & Neiva), the common vector of visceral leishmaniasis, accounted for 4-7% of the sand fly community. Lutzomyia panamensis (Shannon) and Lutzomyia gomezi (Nitzulescu), putative vectors of Leishmania braziliensis (Vianna), had low abundances at both study sites. The zoophilic species Lutzomyia cayennemis (Floch & Abonnenc) and Lutzomyia trinidadensis (Newstead) were present in variable numbers according to trapping methods and site. Habitat degradation negatively affected sand fly communities, but medically important species were able to exploit modified environments, thereby contributing to Leishmania endemicity.

TI  - Current and future trends in socio-economic, demographic and governance factors affecting global primate conservation
T2  - PEERJ
AB  - Currently, similar to 65% of extant primate species (ca 512 species) distributed in 91 countries in the Neotropics, mainland Africa, Madagascar, South Asia and Southeast Asia are threatened with extinction and 75% have declining populations as a result of deforestation and habitat loss resulting from increasing global market demands, and land conversion for industrial agriculture, cattle production and natural resource extraction. Other pressures that negatively impact primates are unsustainable bushmeat hunting, the illegal trade of primates as pets and as body parts, expanding road networks in previously isolated areas, zoonotic disease transmission and climate change. Here we examine current and future trends in several socio-economic factors directly or indirectly affecting primates to further our understanding of the interdependent relationship between human well-being, sustainable development, and primate population persistence. We found that between 2001 and 2018 ca 191 Mha of tropical forest (30% canopy cover) were lost as a result of human activities in the five primate range regions. Forty-six percent of this loss was in the Neotropics (Mexico, Central and South America), 30% in Southeast Asia, 21% in mainland Africa, 2% in Madagascar and 1% in South Asia. Countries with the greatest losses (ca 57% of total tree cover loss) were Brazil, Indonesia, DRC, China, and Malaysia. Together these countries harbor almost 50% of all extant primate species. In 2018, the world human population was estimated at ca 8bn people, ca 60% of which were found in primate range countries. Projections to 2050 and to 2100 indicate continued rapid growth of the human populations in these five primate range regions, with Africa surpassing all the other regions and totaling ca 4bn people by the year 2100. Socioeconomic indicators show that, compared to developed nations, most primate range countries are characterized by high levels of poverty and income inequality, low human development, low food security, high levels of corruption and weak governance. Models of Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios (SSPs) projected to 2050 and 2100 showed that whereas practices of increasing inequality (SSP4) or unconstrained growth in economic output and energy use (SSP5) are projected to have dire consequences for human well-being and primate survivorship, practices of sustainability-focused growth and equality (SSP1) are expected to have a positive effect on maintaining biodiversity, protecting environments, and improving the human condition. These results stress that improving the well-being, health, and security of the current and future human populations in primate range countries are of paramount importance if we are to move forward with effective policies to protect the world's primate species and promote biodiversity conservation.

TI  - The Relative Importance of Fungal Infection, Conspecific Density and Environmental Heterogeneity for Seedling Survival in a Dominant Tropical Tree
T2  - BIOTROPICA
AB  - A gap remains in our understanding of how host-specific fungal pathogens impact negative density dependence (NDD). Here, we investigated survival of Cinnamomum subavenium Miq. seedlings, the dominant canopy species in a seasonal tropical evergreen forest, Thailand. It is infected by a host-specific fungus that is easily identifiable in the field. We quantified the effects of conspecific seedling and adult density on fungal infection and seedling survival over a wide range of environmental heterogeneity in elevation, understory vegetation and presence of forest gaps. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) for seedling survival revealed that fungal infection significantly reduced survival and had the strongest effect on seedling survival as compared with conspecific density and environmental heterogeneity. Adult conspecific density was not, however, significantly correlated with the probability of infection, and conspecific seedling density was positively associated with increased infection only at high elevations. In contrast to infection, we found a significant positive correlation between conspecific seedling density and the probability of seedling survival. Consequently, our results demonstrate that fungal infection can have major impacts on seedling survival, but not in a manner consistent with local NDD effects on seedlings, as assumed in the Janzen-Connell hypothesis. Our study provides an example of how quantifying the interaction between environmental heterogeneity and a host-specific plant-pathogen can yield unexpected insights into the dynamics of seedling populations. The combined effects of host-specific pathogens and environmental heterogeneity on survival of dominant seedling species may ultimately provide a chance for rarer species to recruit.

TI  - The rise of hyperabundant native generalists threatens both humans and nature
T2  - BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS
AB  - In many disturbed terrestrial landscapes, a subset of native generalist vertebrates thrives. The population trends of these disturbance-tolerant species may be driven by multiple factors, including habitat preferences, foraging opportunities (including crop raiding or human refuse), lower mortality when their predators are persecuted (the 'human shield' effect) and reduced competition due to declines of disturbance-sensitive species. A pronounced elevation in the abundance of disturbance-tolerant wildlife can drive numerous cascading impacts on food webs, biodiversity, vegetation structure and people in coupled human-natural systems. There is also concern for increased risk of zoonotic disease transfer to humans and domestic animals from wildlife species with high pathogen loads as their abundance and proximity to humans increases. Here we use field data from 58 landscapes to document a supra-regional phenomenon of the hyperabundance and community dominance of Southeast Asian wild pigs and macaques. These two groups were chosen as prime candidates capable of reaching hyperabundance as they are edge adapted, with gregarious social structure, omnivorous diets, rapid reproduction and high tolerance to human proximity. Compared to intact interior forests, population densities in degraded forests were 148% and 87% higher for wild boar and macaques, respectively. In landscapes with >60% oil palm coverage, wild boar and pig-tailed macaque estimated abundances were 337% and 447% higher than landscapes with <1% oil palm coverage, respectively, suggesting marked demographic benefits accrued by crop raiding on calorie-rich food subsidies. There was extreme community dominance in forest landscapes with >20% oil palm cover where two pig and two macaque species accounted for >80% of independent camera trap detections, leaving 1 kg considered. Establishing the population trends of pigs and macaques is imperative since they are linked to cascading impacts on the fauna and flora of local forest ecosystems, disease and human health, and economics (i.e., crop losses). The severity of potential negative cascading effects may motivate control efforts to achieve ecosystem integrity, human health and conservation objectives. Our review concludes that the rise of native generalists can be mediated by specific types of degradation, which influences the ecology and conservation of natural areas, creating both positive and detrimental impacts on intact ecosystems and human society.

TI  - Canopy height model characteristics derived from airbone laser scanning and its effectiveness in discriminating various tropical moist forest types
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Mapping tropical forests to a sufficient level of spatial resolution and structural detail is a prerequisite for their rational management, which however remains a largely unmet challenge. We explore the degree to which a forest canopy height model (CHM) derived from airborne laser scanning (ALS) can discriminate between five forest types of similar height but varying structure or composition. We systematically compare various textural features (Haralick, Fourier transform-based, and wavelet-based features) and various classification procedures (linear discriminant analysis (LDA), random forest(RF), and support vector machine (SVM)) applied to two sizes of sampling units (64mx 64 m and 32mx 32 m). Simple height distribution statistics achieve at best 70% classification accuracy in our sample set comprising 120 sampling units of 64mx 64 m. Using w avelet-based features, this accuracy increases to 79% but drops by 10% with smaller sampling units (32mx 32 m). Classifier performance depends on the texture feature set used, but SVM and RF tend to perform better than LDA. High discrimination rates between forests types of similar height indicate that the ALS-derived CHM provides information suitable for mapping of tropical forest types. Wavelet-based texture features coupled with a SVM classifier was found to be the most promising combination of methods. Ancillary data derived from laser scans and notably topography could be used jointly for an improved segmentation scheme.

TI  - The COVID-19 crisis and Amazonia's indigenous people: Implications for conservation and global health
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Ecosystem health and zoonotic diseases are closely interwoven. Even as we grapple with the SARSCoronavirus-2 pandemic, which may have its origins in wildlife, weakening environmental policies in the Brazilian Amazon are elevating the risk of additional zoonotic spillover events. We examine the links between deforestation and disease emergence in the Amazon, as illustrated by outbreaks of yellow fever virus, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, and Oropouche virus. It has been well established that in Brazil, indigenous territories exhibit lower rates of forest conversion and degradation than in areas designated for sustainable use. In this way, Amazonia's indigenous tribes promote public health while sustaining ecosystem services. However, indigenous land rights are under attack due to current policies enabling illegal land grabbing, mining and logging. Further adding to the existential struggle of indigenous tribes, malaria and SARS-Coronavirus-2 are wreaking havoc on these vulnerable populations. There is a critical need for protection of indigenous people's rights and health, as well as a sustained effort to support the study of mechanisms underlying anthropogenic land use change and zoonotic disease risk.

TI  - Mapping invasive strawberry guava (<i>Psidium cattleianum</i>) in tropical forests of Mauritius with Sentinel-2 and machine learning
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Invasive flora alien species (IAS) pose a serious threat to biodiversity in tropical forests. This study evaluated different classification approaches for remote sensing of the target IAS, strawberry guava (Psidium cattleianum), using open-access satellite imagery to aid research and understanding of IAS impacts in tropical forests. This is likely the first study using freely available open-access imagery to map strawberry guava, and the first mapping of invasive species in Mauritius using remote sensing. Ground-based observations in Black River Gorges National Park (BRGNP), Mauritius, resulted in 4670 'ground truth' samples across three land cover classes representing different levels of strawberry guava canopy cover; 70% of these ground truth data were used for training and model tuning, and 30% were held-out for testing. Classification was performed using Sentinel-2 MSI images and Google Earth Engine. Computation of Jeffries-Matusita distance supported the addition of Grey Level Co-Occurrence Matrix texture measures, and spectral indices (ARI1, and ReNDVI) for classification, since these features increased separability of strawberry guava cover classes substantially over using spectral bands alone. Higher than 80% overall and individual class accuracies were achieved with both Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification of strawberry guava in BRGNP. RF is recommended for similar future applications for its higher overall accuracy (97.60% +/- .20% at 95% confidence), lower variation, and prediction of more homogenous class regions. This study found that strawberry guava canopy cover in BRGNP was highest in central regions and correlated to steeper slopes, with little overall change from 2016 to 2020.

TI  - Evaluation of the Diversity of Culicidae Vectors of the Sylvatic Yellow Fever Virus in Atlantic Forest Remnants with the Use of Ovitraps and Bamboo Traps
T2  - VECTOR-BORNE AND ZOONOTIC DISEASES
AB  - Mosquitoes transmit several pathogens in tropical regions, especially in forest areas. The diseases caused by these pathogens include malaria and several arboviruses such as yellow fever. Brazil has the largest endemic area in the world for yellow fever. Many factors can affect the sylvatic cycle of the disease, shifting it into human-inhabited areas. This study aims to examine the oviposition behavior of mosquito species that are effective or potential vectors of the yellow fever virus and which colonize bamboo traps and ovitraps installed at different heights. The positions of the traps in the strata were changed every 15 days. The collection of immature stages (eggs, larvae, and pupae) was performed every 2 weeks for 12 months from August 2018 to July 2019 in the city of Nova Iguacu, state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in an area near the Tingua Biological Reserve (REBIO) in the districts of Adrianopolis and Rio D'ouro. Statistical tests were used to compare oviposition at each stratum, and correlation tests showed the relationship between the presence of eggs and immature mosquitoes (larvae and pupae) and temperature, precipitation, and trap type. The diversity was calculated for each trap type and height, as well as the dry and rainy seasons. During the sampling period, 3929 eggs and 4953 larvae and pupae were collected. The traps installed in the high strata remained empty when traps on the ground were installed at the same time, although not when they were installed on their own. The results obtained with this new proposed methodology suggest that diversity is greatest in the rainy season and in bamboo traps for either stratum. Furthermore, this study suggests that mosquitoes begin searching for breeding sites at ground level. Higher levels may be occupied due to the absence or impermanence of other breeding sites.

TI  - Distribution of mosquitoes in relation to urban landscape characteristics
T2  - BULLETIN OF ENTOMOLOGICAL RESEARCH
AB  - The current global increase in prevalence of vector borne diseases, as well as an expansion of tropical infections to more temperate zones, justifies further studies on vector populations. Urban areas may favour viral transmission to humans through close contacts between the vectors and the vertebrate hosts, and also affecting mosquito populations by offering larval habitat, refuges and adequate microclimates to survive the winter. This work analyses the spatial distribution of potential vector mosquitoes in relation to landscape characteristics in an urban environment in a temperate climate region. Mosquitoes were trapped monthly from October 2005 to March 2006 in 25 sites within Cordoba city and suburbs with miniature light traps +CO2. Nine species were collected, and the most abundant were Culex quinquefasciatus (37.1%), C. apicinus (26.6%) and Aedes aegypti (13.9%). Species that may be involved in SLEv transmission were recorded throughout the sampling. C. quinquefasciatus was detected in 92% of the sites; however, only two sites showed consistently larger collections. The site of highest C. quinquefasciatus abundance was located within an area of high Saint Louis Encefalitis virus prevalence and risk of infection, further supporting this species involvement as a vector. Significant correlations were detected between land cover characteristics and abundance of C. apicinus, C. interfor and C. maxi that were consistent with previous knowledge about their larval habitat and domestic preferences, which may be useful for targeting vector control operations.

TI  - Ecological characterization of a tick community across a landscape gradient exhibiting differential anthropogenic disturbance in the Atlantic Forest ecoregion in Argentina
T2  - MEDICAL AND VETERINARY ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - An ecological analysis of a tick (Ixodida: Ixodidae) community across a landscape gradient presenting differential anthropogenic disturbance in the Atlantic Forest ecoregion in Argentina was performed. Ticks were collected from vegetation and hosts between September 2014 and August 2016. A total of 12 697 free-living ticks and 3347 specimens from hosts were collected, including 317 ticks infesting humans. The values obtained show considerable species diversity in the forest environment accompanied by low equitability. The similarity index derived from a comparison of forest and agricultural environments was higher than that calculated by comparing forest and urban environments. The data suggest that although a cycle of one generation per year is apparent in some species, more than one cohort may co-exist within the populations of some of these species. Well-marked patterns of the seasonal distribution of free-living tick species emerged in environments with no anthropic modification. The results indicate that forest environments are more suitable habitats than agricultural and urban environments for many species of native tick, but are unsuitable for exotic species that have successfully established in environments that have been modified by man.

TI  - Spatial patterns and estimates of global forest litterfall
T2  - ECOSPHERE
AB  - The quantitative knowledge of global forest litterfall is very important for understanding the global biogeochemical cycle and evaluating of forest ecosystem services. Our aims are to show the spati-otemporal patterns of forest litterfall and the variation in different forest types and climate zones in the world. We compiled the global forest litterfall dataset of 2347 total litterfall and 1507 leaf litterfall measurements by a survey of literature published. The total litterfall and leaf litterfall were estimated in 2000 and 2009, respectively, through raster and vector calculation based on remote sensing-based global vegetation cover data. The total litterfall and leaf litterfall were 31.5 Pg and 22 Pg in 2000 and 26 Pg and 18 Pg in 2009, respectively. The spatial pattern of litterfall and leaf litterfall at global scale between 2000 and 2009 was generally similar. The largest fractions of forest litterfall were in evergreen broadleaved forests (37%), followed by needle-leaved forests (25%), deciduous broadleaved forests (20%), and others (18%) in 2000. The order of the fractions for forest litterfall was the tropical (50%), boreal (24%), temperate (17%), and subtropical forests (9%) in 2000. The ratios of leaf litterfall to litterfall were 70% in 2000 and 72% in 2009. The variability of global litterfall was most explained by the actual evapotranspiration. The reduction in total litterfall and leaf litterfall between 2000 and 2009 was coupled with the decrease in forest areas. The GIS-based geostatistics combining with the regression model represents a powerful approach for estimating the global spatial distribution, composition, and magnitude of litterfall.

TI  - Enzootic Arbovirus Surveillance in Forest Habitat and Phylogenetic Characterization of Novel Isolates of Gamboa Virus in Panama
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Landscape changes occurring in Panama, a country whose geographic location and climate have historically supported arbovirus transmission, prompted the hypothesis that arbovirus prevalence increases with degradation of tropical forest habitats. Investigations at four variably degraded sites revealed a diverse array of potential mosquito vectors, several of which are known vectors of arbovirus pathogens. Overall, 675 pools consisting of 25,787 mosquitoes and representing 29 species from nine genera (collected at ground and canopy height across all habitats) were screened for cytopathic viruses on Vero cells. We detected four isolates of Gamboa virus (family: Bunyaviridae; genus: Ortho-bunyavirus) from pools of Aedeomyia squamipennis captured at canopy level in November 2012. Phylogenetic characterization of complete genome sequences shows the new isolates to be closely related to each other with strong evidence of reassortment among the M segment of Panamanian Gamboa isolates and several other viruses of this group. At the site yielding viruses, Soberania National Park in central Panama, 18 mosquito species were identified, and the predominant taxa included A. squamipennis, Coquillettidia nigricans, and Mansonia titillans.

TI  - BIOMASS ESTIMATION BASED ON MULTILINEAR REGRESSION AND MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS IN THE MAYOMBE TROPICAL FOREST, IN THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO
T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB  - Accurate forest aboveground biomass estimations have always been of crucial importance for sustainable forest management. However, a choice of the suitable statistical modelling method and predictor variables from remotely sensed data remains the keystone for providing accurate aboveground biomass estimates. The present study intended to compare the potential of four modelling techniques, including RandomForest, Support vector machine, multilinear regression, and K-nearest neighbour for estimating aboveground biomass using vegetation indices, spectral information, and both vegetation indices and spectral bands. The results have revealed that machine learning algorithms provide better results than the multilinear regression method. Indeed, the multilinear regression method produced the lowest R2 and the greatest RMSE. Besides, the RandomForest performed better by providing accurate results compared to other machine learning algorithms. However, comparing the three sets of predictors, the vegetation indices have yielded accurate results of aboveground biomass and the strongest modelling power. Our results have also revealed that the RF is the best choice for predicting aboveground biomass for the purpose of reducing over- or under-estimation problems. This study has demonstrated the potential of the machine learning algorithms in predicting aboveground biomass in the tropical forest, using freely remotely sensed data derived from sensors with medium spatial resolution.

TI  - Historical footprints in contemporary land use systems: forest cover changes in savannah woodlands in the Sudano-Sahelian zone
T2  - GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
AB  - The paper analyses land use trajectories in savannah woodlands in the Central-West Region, Burkina Faso and the Upper East Region in northern Ghana by use of satellite images and historical archives. Observed trends differ in terms of spatial location and correlation with population pressure from normally accepted characterizations. Colonial forestry policies are proposed as key determinants of present-day land use patterns. However, these reinforced pre-colonial land use patterns inasmuch as land gazetted as forest reserves were tracts affected by vectors of human and livestock disease. It is suggested that the transformation of wooded agricultural landscapes in the Sudano-Sahelian region is the outcome of historically and culturally embedded interactions between complex social, economic and ecological processes which operate at widely varying scales and which change over time; the implications hereof for modelling of global environmental issues is discussed.

TI  - Globalization of the Amazon soy and beef industries: Opportunities for conservation
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
AB  - Amazon beef and soybean industries, the primary drivers of Amazon deforestation, are increasingly responsive to economic signals emanating from around the world, such as those associated with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, "mad cow disease") outbreaks and China's economic growth. The expanding role of these economic "teleconnections" (coupled phenomena that take place in distant places on the planet) led to a 3-year period (2002-2004) of historically high deforestation rates. But it also increases the potential for large-scale conservation in the region as markets and finance institutions demand better environmental and social performance of beef and soy producers. Cattle ranchers and soy farmers who have generally opposed ambitious government regulations that require forest reserves on private property are realizing that good land stewardship-including compliance with legislation-may increase their access to expanding domestic and international markets and to credit and lower the risk of "losing" their land to agrarian reform. The realization of this potential depends on the successful negotiation of social and environmental performance criteria and an associated system of certification that are acceptable to both the industries and civil society. The foot-and-mouth eradication system, in which geographic zones win permission to export beef, may provide an important model for the design of a low-cost, peer-enforced, socio environmental certification system that becomes the mechanism by which beef and soy industries gain access to markets outside the Amazon.

AB  - Endomyocardial fibrosis (EMF), an idiopathic cardiac disorder, occurs predominantly in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. We present herein a report of EMF in a young man from the savannah belt of Nigeria. He was a 19-year-old young man who presented with recent onset of palpitation and dyspnea and was followed up elsewhere for 3 years as a case of chronic liver disease due to progressive abdominal distension. Clinical examination revealed an undernourished young man with atrial fibrillation and features of heart failure. His electrocardiogram showed features of atrial fibrillation, while echocardiogram showed enlarged right atrium, tricuspid incompetence, and signs of fibrosis in the ventricles. Although EMF occurs primarily in the subtropical regions of Africa in its typical manifestation, in this report it was in the savannah belt.

TI  - Distribution of Phlebotomine Sand Flies (Diptera: Psychodidae) in a Primary Forest-Crop Interface, Salta, Argentina
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - Disordered urbanization and deforestation are the main activities proposed as causal factors of re-emergence of American cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania braziliensis. The purpose of this work was to investigate, in the hyperendemic area of Argentina, the distribution of Phlebotomine sand flies at the modified primary vegetation-crop interface, as one of the potential sites where the effects of a anging landscape on sand fly populations may be manifested. Twenty samplings were made between June 2004 and August 2005. The traps to catch sand flies were set on two consecutive nights every month (except in 5 mo, where it became every 15 cl). The relationship between sand fly abuadance and meteorological and landscape variables was analyzed using non-metric multidimensional scaling and Kendall's correlation coefficients. Lutzomyia neivai (Pinto) was the most abundant species, followed by Lutzomyia migonei (Franca), Lutzomyia cortelezzii (Brethes), Lutzomyia shannoni (Dyar), and Lutzomyia punctigeniculata (Floch and Abonnenc). Traps located close to modified areas collected the greatest numbers of sand flies, whereas traps located in the least modified area (adjacent to the primary vegetation) collected the fewest. There was a strong negative correlation between the abundance of sand flies and precipitation. This study shows that even small modifications in the landscape led to an increase in sand fly abundance, mainly Lu. neivai, a Leishmania braziliensis vector. This underscores the need for recommendations about the risk of American cutaneous leishmaniasis before any environmental intervention is done in an endemic area, as well as: for the monitoring of sand fly population dynamics at the site of intervention, before, during, and after the process.

TI  - Intra and inter-annual variation in seed rain in a secondary dry tropical forest excluded from chronic disturbance
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Domestic livestock grazing and firewood extraction are chronic and pervasive disturbances in dry secondary forest that reduce diversity and modify composition. Exclosure of such disturbances may allow the reestablishment of original diversity. To investigate potential vegetation recovery following 30 years of perturbation, seed rain was evaluated monthly during 3 years in 96 0.78 m(2) seed traps located in eight exclosures established in 2006 in a species-poor secondary dry forest in central Mexico. Twelve additional seed traps were located outside the exclosures in 2010 for comparison purposes. Baseline diversity of seed sources (trees, >= 5 cm DBH) was recorded to compare standing tree composition with seed rain. Also, baseline diversity of potential primary (birds) and secondary (ants) dispersal vectors were registered to infer current plant-animal interactions. Total seed rain over 3 years within the exclosures comprised 180,375 seeds from 61 woody species, an average of 1.12 seeds/m(2)/month. Half of these species (31) and 95% of the seeds falling within the exclosures belonged to trees typical of perturbed sites. Sixty percent of all recorded seeds belonged to an early-successional, bird-dispersed shrub (Hamelia patens Jacq., Rubiaceae). Seed rain at one non-excluded plot was dominated by the wind-dispersed early-successional tree Heliocarpus sp. (Tiliaceae). Richness and seed density increased significantly in the second year of exclusion; however, by the third year, richness remained constant while seed density decreased. Seed rain was richer and more abundant during the dry season and was dominated by wind-dispersed species. Phenology, successional status and the dispersal modes of woody species explained most variance in richness and seed density of seed rain in early-successional dry forest. Seeds of early-successional species were dispersed in equal measure by abiotic and biotic vectors, whereas biotic vectors dispersed a higher density of late-successional seeds. The amount and timing of fall of abiotically dispersed seeds of the three most abundant species in the standing tree community may prolong their current domination of the landscape. However, even when richness in the seed rain within exclosures remained constant through time, composition was gradually shifting towards animal-dispersed species which may start a positive feedback producing an increase in animal visitation and a further increase of richness.

TI  - Changes in malaria vector bionomics and transmission patterns in the equatorial forest region of Cameroon between 2000 and 2017
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
AB  - Background: Increased use of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) over the last decade has considerably improved the control of malaria in sub-Saharan Africa. However, there is still a paucity of data on the influence of LLIN use and other factors on mosquito bionomics in different epidemiological foci. The objective of this study was to provide updated data on the evolution of vector bionomics and malaria transmission patterns in the equatorial forest region of Cameroon over the period 2000-2017, during which LLIN coverage has increased substantially.
   Methods: The study was conducted in Olama and Nyabessan, two villages situated in the equatorial forest region. Mosquito collections from 2016-2017 were compared to those of 2000-2001. Mosquitoes were sampled using both human landing catches and indoor sprays, and were identified using morphological taxonomic keys. Specimens belonging to the An. gambiae complex were further identified using molecular tools. Insecticide resistance bioassays were undertaken on An. gambiae to assess the susceptibility levels to both permethrin and deltamethrin. Mosquitoes were screened for Plasmodium falciparum infection and blood-feeding preference using the ELISA technique. Parasitological surveys in the population were conducted to determine the prevalence of Plasmodium infection using rapid diagnostic tests.
   Results: A change in the species composition of sampled mosquitoes was recorded between the 2000-2001 collections and those of 2016-2017. A drop in the density of the local primary vectors An. nili and An. moucheti in the forest region was recorded, whereas there was an increase in the density of An. gambiae (s.l.), An. marshallii, An. ziemannii and An. paludis. A change in the biting behaviour from indoor to outdoor was recorded in Olama. Very few indoor resting mosquitoes were collected. A change in the night biting cycle was recorded with mosquitoes displaying a shift from night biting to late evening/early in the night. Several mosquitoes were found positive for Plasmodium infection, thus sustaining continuous transmission of malaria in both sites. Reduction of malaria transmission in Nyabessan was lower than that seen in Olama and associated with deforestation and the construction of a dam that may have enabled a more efficient vector, An. gambiae (s.l.), to invade the area. A high level of resistance to pyrethroids (permethrin and deltamethrin) was detected for An. gambiae in both sites. High parasite prevalence was recorded in both sites, with children of 0-16 years being the most affected. In both Olama and Nyabessan, bed net usage appeared to correlate to protection against malaria infection.
   Conclusions: The study shows important changes in the bionomics of vector populations and malaria transmission patterns in the equatorial forest region. The changes call for more concerted efforts to address challenges such as insecticide resistance, environmental modifications or behavioural changes affecting the performance of current control measures.

AB  - Widespread amphibian extinctions in the mountains of the American tropics have been blamed on the interaction of anthropogenic climate change and a lethal pathogen. However, limited meteorological records make it difficult to conclude whether current climate conditions at these sites are actually exceptional in the context of natural variability. We use stable oxygen isotope measurements from trees without annual rings to reconstruct a century of hydroclimatology in the Monteverde Cloud Forest of Costa Rica. High-resolution measurements reveal coherent isotope cycles that provide annual chronological control and paleoclimate information. Climate variability is dominated by interannual variance in dry season moisture associated with El Nino Southern Oscillation events. There is no evidence of a trend associated with global warming. Rather, the extinction of the Monteverde golden toad (Bufo periglenes) appears to have coincided with an exceptionally dry interval caused by the 1986-1987 El Nino event.

TI  - Molecular Techniques in Ecohealth Research Toolkit: Facilitating Estimation of Aggregate Gastroenteritis Burden in an Irrigated Periurban Landscape
T2  - ECOHEALTH
AB  - Assessment of microbial hazards associated with certain environmental matrices, livelihood strategies, and food handling practices are constrained by time-consuming conventional microbiological techniques that lead to health risk assessments of narrow geographic or time scope, often targeting very few pathogens. Health risk assessment based on one or few indicator organisms underestimates true disease burden due a number of coexisting causative pathogens. Here, we employed molecular techniques in a survey of Cryptosporidium parvum, Giardia lamblia, Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Vibrio cholera, and Rotavirus A densities in canal water with respect to seasonality and spatial distribution of point-nonpoint pollution sources. Three irrigational canals stretching across nearly a 150-km(2) periurban landscape, traditionally used for agricultural irrigation but function as vital part of municipal wastewater stabilization in recent years, were investigated. Compiled stochastic data (pathogen concentration, susceptible populations) and literature-obtained deterministic data (pathogen dose-response model parameter values) were used in estimating waterborne gastroenteritis burden. Exposure scenarios include swimming or fishing, consuming canal water-irrigated vegetables, and ingesting or inhaling water aerosols while working in canal water-irrigated fields. Estimated annual gastroenteritis burden due individual pathogens among the sampling points was -10.6log(10) to -2.2log(10) DALYs. Aggregated annual gastroenteritis burden due all the target pathogens per sampling point was -3.1log(10) to -1.9log(10) DALYs, far exceeding WHO acceptable limit of -6.0log(10) DALYs. The present approach will facilitate the comprehensive collection of surface water microbiological baseline data and setting of benchmarks for interventions aimed at reducing microbial hazards in similar landscapes worldwide.

TI  - Mapping the 3D Distribution of Shorea Tree Species Based Upon Information Extracted from Worldview-2 and LiDAR Data
T2  - 2018 IEEE 8TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SYSTEM ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY (ICSET)
CP  - 8th IEEE International Conference on System Engineering and Technology (ICSET)
AB  - Mapping and monitoring trees in tropical forest is deemed necessary especially for forest personnel. Unfortunately, acquisition of tree parameters for mapping purposes are tedious due to labour intensive, timely and cost-consuming. Thus, the advancement of remote sensing technology which provides tree parameters economically in term of cost and time saving over large forest area is in demand. The intent of this study is to map the distribution of Shorea tree species in the Ampang Forest Reserve using information extracted from Worldview-2 and LiDAR datasets. The pan-sharpening Worldview-2 imagery was used to classify the tropical trees using the support vector machine (SVM) image classification method. The overall classification accuracy for SVM method was 90.28% and the individual accuracy for Shorea and mixed tree species ranges from 68.25% to 82.86%. Finally, the classified result was overlaid with tree height information extracted from LiDAR data and forming the 3D distribution of Shorea tree species in the dense tropical forest area.

TI  - Do fungal pathogens drive density-dependent mortality in established seedlings of two dominant African rain-forest trees?
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY
AB  - Where one or a few tree species reach local high abundance, different ecological factors may variously facilitate or hinder their regeneration. Plant pathogens are thought to be one of those possible agents which drive intraspecilic density-dependent mortality of tree seedlings in tropical forests. Experimental evidence for this is scarce, however. In an African rain forest at Korup, we manipulated the density of recently established seedlings (similar to 5-8 wk old; low vs. high-density) of two dominant species of contrasting recruitment potential, and altered their exposure to pathogens using a broad-spectrum fungicide. Seedling mortality of the abundantly recruiting subcanopy tree Oubanguia alata was strongly density-dependent after 7 mo, yet fungicide-treated seedlings had slightly higher mortality than controls. By contrast, seedling mortality of the poorly recruiting large canopy-emergent tree Micraberlinia bisulcata was unaffected by density or fungicide. Ectomycorrhizal colonization of M. bisulcata was not affected by density or fungicide either. For O. alata. adverse effects of fungicide on its vesicular arbuscular mycorrhizas may have offset any possible benefit of pathogen removal. We tentatively conclude that fungal pathogens are not a likely major cause of density dependence in O. alata, or of early post-establishment mortality in M. bisulcata. They do not explain the latter's currently very low recruitment rate at Korup.

TI  - Food for thought: The underutilized potential of tropical tree-sourced foods for 21st century sustainable food systems
T2  - PEOPLE AND NATURE
AB  - 1. The global food system is causing large-scale environmental degradation and is a major contributor to climate change. Its low diversity and failure to produce enough fruits and vegetables is contributing to a global health crisis.
   2. The extraordinary diversity of tropical tree species is increasingly recognized to be vital to planetary health and especially important for supporting climate change mitigation. However, they are poorly integrated into food systems. Tropical tree diversity offers the potential for sustainable production of many foods, providing livelihood benefits and multiple ecosystem services including improved human nutrition.
   3. First, we present an overview of these environmental, nutritional and livelihood benefits and show that tree-sourced foods provide important contributions to critical fruit and micronutrient (vitamin A and C) intake in rural populations based on data from sites in seven countries.
   4. Then, we discuss several risks and limitations that must be taken into account when scaling-up tropical tree-based food production, including the importance of production system diversity and risks associated with supply to the global markets.
   5. We conclude by discussing several interventions addressing technical, financial, political and consumer behaviour barriers, with potential to increase the consumption and production of tropical tree-sourced foods, to catalyse a transition towards more sustainable global food systems.

TI  - The increasing threat to European forests from the invasive foliar pine pathogen, Lecanosticta acicola
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - European forests are threatened by increasing numbers of invasive pests and pathogens. Over the past century, Lecanosticta acicola, a foliar pathogen predominantly of Pinus spp., has expanded its range globally, and is increasing in impact. Lecanosticta acicola causes brown spot needle blight, resulting in premature defoliation, reduced growth, and mortality in some hosts. Originating from southern regions of North American, it devastated forests in the USA's southern states in the early twentieth century, and in 1942 was discovered in Spain.Derived from Euphresco project 'Brownspotrisk,' this study aimed to establish the current distribution of Lecanosticta species, and assess the risks of L. acicola to European forests. Pathogen reports from the literature, and new/ unpublished survey data were combined into an open-access geo-database (http://www.portaloff orestpathology.com), and used to visualise the pathogen's range, infer its climatic tolerance, and update its host range. Lecanosticta species have now been recorded in 44 countries, mostly in the northern hemisphere. The type species, L. acicola, has increased its range in recent years, and is present in 24 out of the 26 European countries where data were available. Other species of Lecanosticta are largely restricted to Mexico and Central America, and recently Colombia.The geo-database records demonstrate that L. acicola tolerates a wide range of climates across the northern hemisphere, and indicate its potential to colonise Pinus spp. forests across large swathes of the Europe. Pre-liminary analyses suggest L. acicola could affect 62% of global Pinus species area by the end of this century, under climate change predictions.Although its host range appears slightly narrower than the similar Dothistroma species, Lecanosticta species were recorded on 70 host taxa, mostly Pinus spp., but including, Cedrus and Picea spp. Twenty-three, including species of critical ecological, environmental and economic significance in Europe, are highly susceptible to L. acicola, suffering heavy defoliation and sometimes mortality. Variation in apparent susceptibility between reports could reflect variation between regions in the hosts' genetic make-up, but could also reflect the signif-icant variation in L. acicola populations and lineages found across Europe. This study served to highlight sig-nificant gaps in our understanding of the pathogen's behaviour.Lecanosticta acicola has recently been downgraded from an A1 quarantine pest to a regulated non quarantine pathogen, and is now widely distributed across Europe. With a need to consider disease management, this study also explored global BSNB strategies, and used Case Studies to summarise the tactics employed to date in Europe.

TI  - Conservation and Use of Palm Trees in Brazil's Landscaping
T2  - II INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON LANDSCAPE AND URBAN HORTICULTURE
CP  - 2nd International Conference on Landscape and Urban Horticulture
AB  - Palm trees belong to the Arecaceae family and are widely utilized in landscaping of tropical countries. Although there are many species, just a few are used in Brazil's landscaping, the majority coming from other countries. So, this study had the objective to characterize the plants in the collection of palm trees at UNESP/FCAV, Campus of Jaboticabal, Sao Paulo State, Brazil. The germination of seeds was also studied to increase the production of seedlings for use in landscaping, as this is the biggest difficulty for spreading new species. The introduction of new species in the collection was accomplished. It was also made a survey of major pests and diseases that occur in the collection. The most common pests found were: Brassolis sophorae, Parisoschoenus obesulus, Rhynchophorus palmarum and Coraliomela sp., and the most common disease causing fungi: Colletrotrichum sp., Curvularia sp., Bipolaris sp., Helminthosporium sp., Alternaria sp., Phyllosticta sp., Pestalotia sp., Exosporium palmivorum and Ceratocystis pardoxa.

TI  - Remote Sensing to Study Mangrove Fragmentation and Its Impacts on Leaf Area Index and Gross Primary Productivity in the South of Peninsular Malaysia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Mangrove is classified as an important ecosystem along the shorelines of tropical and subtropical landmasses, which are being degraded at an alarming rate despite numerous international treaties having been agreed. Iskandar Malaysia (IM) is a fast-growing economic region in southern Peninsular Malaysia, where three Ramsar Sites are located. Since the beginning of the 21st century (2000-2019), a total loss of 2907.29 ha of mangrove area has been estimated based on medium-high resolution remote sensing data. This corresponds to an annual loss rate of 1.12%, which is higher than the world mangrove depletion rate. The causes of mangrove loss were identified as land conversion to urban, plantations, and aquaculture activities, where large mangrove areas were shattered into many smaller patches. Fragmentation analysis over the mangrove area shows a reduction in the mean patch size (from 105 ha to 27 ha) and an increase in the number of mangrove patches (130 to 402), edge, and shape complexity, where smaller and isolated mangrove patches were found to be related to the rapid development of IM region. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) Leaf Area Index (LAI) and Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) products were used to inspect the impact of fragmentation on the mangrove ecosystem process. The mean LAI and GPP of mangrove areas that had not undergone any land cover changes over the years showed an increase from 3.03 to 3.55 (LAI) and 5.81 g C m(-2) to 6.73 g C m(-2) (GPP), highlighting the ability of the mangrove forest to assimilate CO2 when it is not disturbed. Similarly, GPP also increased over the gained areas (from 1.88 g C m(-2) to 2.78 g C m(-2)). Meanwhile, areas that lost mangroves, but replaced them with oil palm, had decreased mean LAI from 2.99 to 2.62. In fragmented mangrove patches an increase in GPP was recorded, and this could be due to the smaller patches (<9 ha) and their edge effects where abundance of solar radiation along the edges of the patches may increase productivity. The impact on GPP due to fragmentation is found to rely on the type of land transformation and patch characteristics (size, edge, and shape complexity). The preservation of mangrove forests in a rapidly developing region such as IM is vital to ensure ecosystem, ecology, environment, and biodiversity conservation, in addition to providing economical revenue and supporting human activities.

TI  - Perception and knowledge of grasshoppers among indigenous communities in tropical forest areas of southern Cameroon: Ecosystem conservation, food security, and health
T2  - JOURNAL OF ORTHOPTERA RESEARCH
AB  - The increased attention given to health, food security, and biodiversity conservation in recent years should bring together conventional scientists and indigenous people to share their knowledge systems for better results. This work aims to assess how grasshoppers are perceived by the local people in southern Cameroon, particularly in terms of food, health, and landscape conservation. Villagers were interviewed individually using a rapid rural assessment method in the form of a semi-structured survey. Nearly all people (99%) declared that they are able to identify local grasshoppers, generally through the color of the insect (80%). Crop fields were the most often cited landscape (16%) in terms of abundance of grasshoppers, with forest being less mentioned (8%). In general, villagers claimed that grasshopper abundance increased with forest degradation. Grasshoppers were found during all seasons of the year but noted to be more abundant during the long dry seasons. People found grasshoppers both useful and harmful, the most harmful reported being Zonocerus variegatus, an important crop pest. Cassava is the most attacked crop with 75-100% losses. Industrial crops, such as cocoa, coffee, and bananas, were not cited as being damaged by grasshoppers. The most effective conventional method cited for the control of pest grasshoppers is the use of pesticides (53%) with, in most cases (27%), a 75-100% efficiency. The traditional method of spreading ash was also often cited (19%), with an estimated efficiency of 25-75%. Biological methods were neither cited nor used by the villagers. Most of them (87%) declared that they eat grasshoppers; some sold these insects in the market (58%) and some used them to treat diseases (11%).

TI  - Machine learning and drug discovery for neglected tropical diseases
T2  - BMC BIOINFORMATICS
AB  - Neglected tropical diseases affect millions of individuals and cause loss of productivity worldwide. They are common in developing countries without the financial resources for research and drug development. With increased availability of data from high throughput screening, machine learning has been introduced into the drug discovery process. Models can be trained to predict biological activities of compounds before working in the lab. In this study, we use three publicly available, high-throughput screening datasets to train machine learning models to predict biological activities related to inhibition of species that cause leishmaniasis, American trypanosomiasis (Chagas disease), and African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness). We compare machine learning models (tree based models, naive Bayes classifiers, and neural networks), featurizing methods (circular fingerprints, MACCS fingerprints, and RDKit descriptors), and techniques to deal with the imbalanced data (oversampling, undersampling, class weight/sample weight).

TI  - Anthropogenic landscapes increase <i>Campylobacter jejuni</i> infections in urbanizing banded mongoose (<i>Mungos mungo</i>): A one health approach
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Author summary
   Campylobacter infections are increasing worldwide but we still know little about the true burden of disease in the developing world, and even less about the role of wildlife and environmental reservoirs in human exposure and infection. Here we take a one-health approach evaluating Campylobacter infections in humans, banded mongooses (Mungos mungo), and the environment. We found evidence of widespread infection with Campylobacter spp. infecting nearly a quarter of sampled adults and children (23.0%, n = 122, 2011), dominantly with C. jejuni. Banded mongooses live in close association with humans in the area and over half of the animals sampled were found positive for Campylobacter spp. (56%, n = 201, 2017). Infection with C. jejuni was greater among mongooses utilizing human-made structures as den sites than those using natural dens. These data suggest that wildlife utilization of anthropogenic landscapes may increase C. jejuni exposure and infection. In turn, pathogen circulation and transmission in urbanizing wildlife reservoirs may increase human vulnerability to infection, particularly impoverished populations, where greater environmental exposures are expected.
   Background
   Campylobacter is a common, but neglected foodborne-zoonotic pathogen, identified as a growing cause of foodborne disease worldwide. Wildlife and domestic animals are considered important reservoirs, but little is known about pathogen infection dynamics in free-ranging mammalian wildlife particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. In countries like Botswana, there is significant overlap between humans and wildlife, with the human population having one of the highest HIV infection rates in the world, increasing vulnerability to infection.
   Methodology/Principal findings
   We investigated Campylobacter occurrence in archived human fecal samples (children and adults, n = 122, 2011), feces from free-ranging banded mongooses (Mungos mungo, n = 201), surface water (n = 70), and river sediment samples (n = 81) collected in 2017 from the Chobe District, northern Botswana. Campylobacter spp. was widespread in humans (23.0%, 95% CI 13.9-35.4%), with infections dominantly associated with C. jejuni (82.1%, n = 28, 95% CI 55.1-94.5%). A small number of patients presented with asymptomatic infections (n = 6). While Campylobacter spp. was rare or absent in environmental samples, over half of sampled mongooses tested positive (56%, 95% CI 45.6-65.4%). Across the urban-wilderness continuum, we found significant differences in Campylobacter spp. detection associated with the type of den used by study mongooses. Mongooses utilizing man-made structures as den sites had significantly higher levels of C. jejuni infection (p = 0.019) than mongooses using natural dens. Conversely, mongooses using natural dens had overall higher levels of detection of Campylobacter at the genus level (p = 0.001).
   Conclusions
   These results suggest that landscape features may have important influences on Campylobacter species exposure and transmission dynamics in wildlife. In particular, data suggest that human-modified landscapes may increase C. jejuni infection, a primarily human pathogen, in banded mongooses. Pathogen circulation and transmission in urbanizing wildlife reservoirs may increase human vulnerability to infection, findings that may have critical implications for both public and animal health in regions where people live in close proximity to wildlife.

TI  - Helminth associated hypereosinophilia and tropical endomyocardial fibrosis (EMF) in Nigeria
T2  - ACTA TROPICA
AB  - There should be a recognisable trend between the incidence of hypereosinophilia and the duration of tropical endomyocardial fibrosis (EMF), if the hypothesis, that EMF is the burnt out phase of eosinophil associated heart disease, is correct. We tested this hypothesis in a prospective study of 89 consecutive EMF cases over an 18 year period at two Nigerian locations (Ife in South West and Calabar in South East). We carefully dated the duration of EMF symptoms at first presentation and screened for hypereosinophilia (eosinophilia greater than or equal to 1500/mm(3)), and their causes. When no cause was identified for hypereosinophilia we gave a therapeutic trial with diethylcarbamazine to the patients.
   An eosinophil count greater than or equal to 1000/mm(3) was recorded in 80% of 24 cases seen within 6 months; 55% of 46 cases seen 0-24 months; 54% of 18 cases seen 25-48 months and 21% of 25 cases seen more than 49 months of onset of symptoms: while the respective distribution of eosinophil count greater than or equal to 1500/mm(3) for similar periods were 66, 44, 27 and 21%. This reflects a highly significant (P < 0.001) inverse relationship between hypereosinophilia and the duration of EMF and strengthens the concept that EMF (without eosinophilia) represents the late stage of eosinophilic heart disease.
   The localisation of endemic EMF to the low-lying tropical rain forest Zone and its predominant occurrence among rural dwellers and farmers suggest a vector borne etiologic agent. Microfilaria was the most likely cause of hypereosinophilia in the cases presented. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Geospatial clustering, seasonal trend and forecasting of Kyasanur Forest Disease in the state of Goa, India, 2015-2018
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HEALTH
AB  - Introduction Five states in India are reporting sporadic outbreaks of Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD). Goa experienced an outbreak of KFD in 2015. It remains as an important differential diagnosis for tropical fever in the endemic regions. Few studies among neighboring two states (Karnataka and Kerala) have described the epidemiological characteristics of KFD. However, there is no study which describes the same among cases in the state of Goa. Hence, we planned to understand the epidemiology (time, place, and person distribution) of the disease including seasonal pattern with forecasting using zero-inflated negative binomial regression and time series models. We also explored geo-spatial clustering of KFD cases in Goa during 2015-2018 which would help design effective intervention to curb its transmission in Goa. Results Blood samples of all suspected cases of KFD during 2015 to 2018 were tested using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction technique. Reports of these results were periodically shared with the state surveillance unit. Records of 448 confirmed cases of KFD available at the State Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme were analyzed. The mean (SD) age of the patients was 41.6 (14.9) years. Of 143 cases with documented travel history, 135 (94.4%) had history of travel to forest for cashew plucking. Two thirds of cases (66.3%) did not receive KFD vaccine prior to the disease. Case fatality rate of 0.9% was reported. Seasonal peaks were observed during January to April, and forecasting demonstrated a peak in cases in the subsequent year also during January-April persisting till May. Around 40 villages located along the Western Ghats had reported KFD, and affected villages continued to report cases in the subsequent years also. Case density-based geographic maps show clustering of cases around the index village. Conclusion Most of the confirmed cases did not receive any vaccination. KFD cases in Goa followed a specific seasonal pattern, and clustering of cases occurred in selected villages located in North Goa. Most of the patients who had suffered from the disease had visited the forest for cashew plucking. Planning for public health interventions such as health education and vaccination campaigns should consider these epidemiological features.

TI  - MODIS probabilistic cloud masking over the Amazonian evergreen tropical forests: a comparison of machine learning-based methods
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Amazonian tropical forests play a significant role in global water, carbon and energy cycles. Satellite remote sensing is presented as a feasible means in order to monitor these forests. In particular, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is amongst major tools for studying this region. Nevertheless, MODIS operative surface variable retrieval was reported to be impacted by cloud contamination effects. A proper cloud masking is a major consideration in order to ensure accuracy when analysing Amazonian tropical forests current and future status. In the present study, the potential of supervised machine learning algorithms in order to overcome this issue is evaluated. In front of global operative MODIS cloud masking algorithms (MYD35 and the Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction Algorithm (MAIAC)) these algorithms benefit from the fact that they can be optimized to properly represent the local cloud conditions of the region. Models considered were: Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), Random Forests (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). These algorithms are able to provide a continuous measure of cloud masking uncertainty (i.e. a probability estimate of each pixel belonging to clear and cloudy class) and therefore can be used for probabilistic cloud masking. Truth reference dataset (a priori knowledge) requirement was satisfied by considering the collocation of Cloud Profiling Radar (CPR) and Cloud Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) observations with MODIS sensor. Model performance was tested using three independent datasets: 1) collocated CPR/CALIOP and MODIS data, 2) MODIS manually classified images and 3) in-situ ground data. For satellite image and in-situ testing results were additionally compared to current operative MYD35 (version 6.1) and MAIAC cloud masking algorithms. Satellite image and in-situ testing results show that machine learning algorithms are able to improve MODIS operative cloud masking performance over the region. MYD35 and MAIAC tend to underestimate and overestimate the cloud cover over the study region, respectively. Amongst the models considered, probabilistic algorithms (LDA, GNB and in less extent QDA) provided better performance than RF, SVM and MLP machine learning algorithms as they were able to better deal with the viewing conditions limitation that resulted from collocating MODIS and CPR/CALIOP observations. In particular, best performance was obtained for LDA with a difference in Kappa coefficient (model minus MODIS operative algorithm) of 0.293/0.155 (MYD35/MAIAC, respectively) considering satellite image testing validation. Worst performance was obtained for MLP with a difference in Kappa coefficient of 0.175/0.037. For in-situ testing, models overall accuracy (OA) and Kappa coefficient values are higher than MYD35/MAIAC respective values. Models are computationally efficient (swath image calculation time between 0.37 and 9.49 s) and thus being able to be implanted for remote-sensing vegetation retrieval processing chains over the Amazonian tropical forests. LDA stands out as the best candidate because of its maximum accuracy and minimum computational associated.

TI  - The role of heterogenous environmental conditions in shaping the spatiotemporal distribution of competing <i>Aedes</i> mosquitoes in Panama: implications for the landscape of arboviral disease transmission
T2  - BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS
AB  - Monitoring the invasion process of the Asian tiger mosquito Aedes albopictus and its interaction with the contender Aedes aegypti, is critical to prevent and control the arthropod-borne viruses (i.e., Arboviruses) they transmit to humans. Generally, the superior ecological competitor Ae. albopictus displaces Ae. aegypti from most geographic areas, with the combining factors of biology and environment influencing the competitive outcome. Nonetheless, detailed studies asserting displacement come largely from sub-tropical areas, with relatively less effort being made in tropical environments, including no comprehensive research about Aedes biological interactions in Mesoamerica. Here, we examine contemporary and historical mosquito surveillance data to assess the role of shifting abiotic conditions in shaping the spatiotemporal distribution of competing Aedes species in the Republic of Panama. In accordance with prior studies, we show that Ae. albopictus has displaced Ae. aegypti under suboptimal wet tropical climate conditions and more vegetated environments within the southwestern Azuero Peninsula. Conversely, in the eastern Azuero Peninsula, Ae. aegypti persists with Ae. albopictus under optimal niche conditions in a dry and more seasonal tropical climate. While species displacement was stable over the course of two years, the presence of both species generally appears to fluctuate in tandem in areas of coexistence. Aedes albopictus was always more frequently found and abundant regardless of location and climatic season. The heterogenous environmental conditions of Panama shape the competitive outcome and micro-geographic distribution of Aedes mosquitoes, with potential consequences for the transmission dynamics of urban and sylvatic zoonotic diseases.

TI  - Vegetative Community Compositional Gradients of Tropical Hardwood Hammocks along the Florida Keys
T2  - BIOTROPICA
AB  - Tropical hardwood hammocks, among the rarest and most threatened vegetative communities in the United States, occur throughout the 225-km Florida Keys archipelago as it extends toward the Caribbean from the southeast tip of peninsular Florida. Compounding their critical conservation status, tropical hardwood hammocks and the dynamics that support their peculiar species diversity in the region are poorly understood. The goal of this study was to explore the dynamics of the species compositional gradient of the hammocks along the Florida Keys, and to identify significant ecological units within the gradient. The primary data for this research were assembled from the Institute for Regional Conservation's floristic database of South Florida. We were able to extract presence/absence data for 295 species from comprehensive surveys of 23 study sites. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling was used to deconstruct the compositional trends into a reduced ordination space. Cluster analysis was subsequently used to identify discrete ecological units. Additionally, we used vector fitting to interpret the significant correlated ancillary variables. Our main results were three well-fitted nonmetric multidimensional scaling axes with three nonoverlapping ecological units. Of the ancillary variables, latitude, longitude, percent composition from biogeographical regions, richness, and area were correlated to the nonmetric multidimensional scaling results. These results increase our understanding of the community structure of the hammocks along the Florida Keys, and can contribute to increasing our ability to adequately protect and restore tropical hardwood hammocks and other similar tropical dry forest communities throughout the Caribbean.

TI  - Impact of habitat fragmentation on tsetse populations and trypanosomosis risk in Eastern Zambia
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
AB  - Background: Fragmentation of tsetse habitat in eastern Zambia is largely due to encroachments by subsistence farmers into new areas in search of new agricultural land. The impact of habitat fragmentation on tsetse populations is not clearly understood. This study was aimed at establishing the impact of habitat fragmentation on physiological and demographic parameters of tsetse flies in order to enhance the understanding of the relationship between fragmentation and African animal trypanosomosis (AAT) risk.
   Methods: A longitudinal study was conducted to establish the age structure, abundance, proportion of females and trypanosome infection rate of Glossina morsitans morsitans Westwood (Diptera: Glossinidae) in areas of varying degrees of habitat fragmentation in Eastern Zambia. Black screen fly rounds were used to sample tsetse populations monthly for 1 year. Logistic regression was used to analyse age, proportion of females and infection rate data.
   Results: Flies got significantly older as fragmentation increased (p < 0.004). The proportion of old flies, i.e. above ovarian category four, increased significantly (P < 0.001) from 25.9 % (CI 21.4-31.1) at the least fragmented site (Lusandwa) to 74.2 % (CI 56.8-86.3) at the highly fragmented site (Chisulo). In the most fragmented area (Kasamanda), tsetse flies had almost disappeared. In the highly fragmented area a significantly higher trypanosome infection rate in tsetse (P < 0.001) than in areas with lower fragmentation was observed. Consequently a comparatively high trypanosomosis incidence rate in livestock was observed there despite lower tsetse density (p < 0.001). The overall proportion of captured female flies increased significantly (P < 0.005) as fragmentation reduced. The proportion increased from 0.135 (CI 0.10-0.18) to 0.285 (CI 0.26-0.31) at the highly and least fragmented sites, respectively.
   Conclusions: Habitat fragmentation creates conditions to which tsetse populations respond physiologically and demographically thereby affecting tsetse-trypanosome interactions and hence influencing trypanosomosis risk. Temperature rise due to fragmentation coupled with dominance of old flies in populations increases infection rate in tsetse and hence creates high risk of trypanosomosis in fragmented areas. Possibilities of how correlations between biological characteristics of populations and the degree of fragmentation can be used to structure populations based on their well-being, using integrated GIS and remote sensing techniques are discussed.

TI  - Machine learning and generalized linear model techniques to predict aboveground biomass in Amazon rainforest using LiDAR data
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
AB  - LiDAR remote sensing data combined with machine learning (ML) techniques have presented great potential for large-scale modeling of tropical forest attributes. However, the large amount of information that can be derived from an aerial LiDAR survey, summed with the intrinsic heterogeneity of tropical environments (e.g., the Amazon), makes it a challenge to accurately estimate forest biophysical variables. The aim of our work is to investigate the potential and accuracy of different ML techniques and a generalized linear model (GLM) to learn the relationships between LiDAR-derived metrics and forest inventory data for aboveground biomass (AGB) prediction in Amazon forest sites under selective logging regimes. The predictive performance of three ML techniques, namely random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and artificial neural network (ANN), was compared against result from the GLM technique, across 85 sample plots. Interestingly, the GLM retrieved the most accurate estimations of forest AGB (rho Spearman's coefficient = 0.87), compared with the ML techniques (RF = 0.77, SVM = 0.67, and ANN = 0.50). A number of possible factors affecting such results are listed and discussed in the text, including sample size and number of predictor variables. Continued research is necessary to improve the confidence of AGB estimation, especially over complex forest structures. (C) 2020 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - Observations on the life history and habits of a tropical sawfly, <i>Sericoceros mexicanus</i> (Kirby), (Hymenoptera: Argidae) on Roatan Island, Honduras
T2  - FORESTRY CHRONICLE
AB  - Observations on the life history and habits of a tropical sawfly, Sericoceros mexicanus, on Roatan Island, Honduras, during January 2002, are reported. This sawfly occurs in southern Mexico and Central America where it feeds on the foliage of Coccoloba spp. On Roatan Island, the only host is seagrape, C. uvifera, a small to medium tree, which occurs on sandy beaches just above tide line. The adults are colourful insects and relatively strong fliers. They swarm around host trees on warm, sunny days and during cool or overcast periods, rest on seagrape foliage and branches. In 2002, a period of peak adult activity occurred between January 8 and 10. Eggs are deposited in circular or slightly oval clusters on the undersides of seagrape leaves. Mean egg cluster size is 32.7, range 7-85. Female adults remain with the egg cluster until they die. Eggs hatch within two or three days of oviposition and the larvae feed gregariously on the edges of seagrape leaves, consuming all of the leaf tissue except the major veins. Larvae undergo six instars. However, the small number of instar VI larvae collected suggests that female larvae may undergo an extra instar, as is the case with other species of sawflies. Pupation occurs in parchment-like cocoons attached to leaves, leaf petioles and branches of seagrape. Occasionally, cocoons are attached to wooden surfaces such as picnic benches. A few instar VI larvae were seen with symptoms suggesting virus infection. While heavily infested trees can suffer complete defoliation, the insect appears to cause little or no permanent damage. Local residents regard the insect as a curiosity rather than a pest and report at least two periods of defoliation a year-January and August.

TI  - Deforestation and Malaria on the Amazon Frontier: Larval Clustering of <i>Anopheles darlingi</i> (Diptera: Culicidae) Determines Focal Distribution of Malaria
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - We performed bimonthly mosquito larval collections during 1 year, in an agricultural settlement in the Brazilian Amazon, as well as an analysis of malaria incidence in neighboring houses. Water collections located at forest fringes were more commonly positive for Anopheles darlingi larvae and Kulldorff spatial analysis pinpointed significant larval clusters at sites directly beneath forest fringes, which were called larval "hotspots." Remote sensing identified 43 "potential" hotspots. Sampling of these areas revealed an 85.7% positivity rate for A. darlingi larvae. Malaria was correlated with shorter distances to potential hotpots and settlers living within 400 m of potential hotspots had a 2.60 higher risk of malaria. Recently arrived settlers, usually located closer to the tip of the triangularly shaped deforestation imprints of side roads, may be more exposed to malaria due to their proximity to the forest fringe. As deforestation progresses, transmission decreases. However, forest remnants inside deforested areas conferred an increased risk of malaria. We propose a model for explaining frontier malaria in the Amazon: because of adaptation of A. darlingi to the forest fringe ecotone, humans are exposed to an increased transmission risk when in proximity to these areas, especially when small dams are created on naturally running water collections.

TI  - Use of a dark object concept and support vector machines to automate forest cover change analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
AB  - An automated method was developed for mapping forest cover change using satellite remote sensing data sets. This multi-temporal classification method consists of a training data automation (TDA) procedure and uses the advanced support vector machines (SVM) algorithm. The TDA procedure automatically generates training data using input satellite images and existing land cover products. The derived high quality training data allow the SVM to produce reliable forest cover change products. This approach was tested in 19 study areas selected from major forest biomes across the globe. In each area a forest cover change map was produced using a pair of Landsat images acquired around 1990 and 2000. High resolution IKONOS images and independently developed reference data sets were available for evaluating the derived change products in 7 of those areas. The overall accuracy values were over 90% for 5 areas, and were 89.4% and 89.6% for the remaining two areas. The user's and producer's accuracies of the forest loss class were over 80% for all 7 study areas, demonstrating that this method is especially effective for mapping major disturbances with low commission errors. IKONOS images were also available in the remaining 12 study areas but they were either located in non-forest areas or in forest areas that did not experience forest cover change between 1990 and 2000. For those areas the IKONOS images were used to assist visual interpretation of the Landsat images in assessing the derived change products. This visual assessment revealed that for most of those areas the derived change products likely were as reliable as those in the 7 areas where accuracy assessment was conducted. The results also suggest that images acquired during leaf-off seasons should not be used in forest cover change analysis in areas where deciduous forests exist. Being highly automatic and with demonstrated capability to produce reliable change products, the TDA-SVM method should be especially usefial for quantifying forest cover change over large areas.

TI  - Perspective A Cautionary Tale Regarding the Use of Causal Inference to Study How Environmental Change Influences Tropical Diseases
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - There has been substantial interest on the effect of large-scale environmental change, such as deforestation, on human health. An important and relatively recent development has been the use of causal-inference approaches (e.g., instrumental variables [IVs]) to more properly analyze this type of observational data. Here, we discuss an important study that attempted to disentangle the effect of malaria on deforestation from the effect of deforestation on malaria using an IV approach. The authors found that deforestation increases malaria (e.g., they estimate that a 10% increase in deforestation leads to a 3.3% increase in malaria incidence) through ecological mechanisms, whereas malaria reduces deforestation through socioeconomic mechanisms. An important characteristic of causal-inference approaches is that they are critically dependent on the plausibility of the underlying assumptions and that, differently from standard statistical models, many of these assumptions are not testable. In particular, we show how important assumptions of the IV approach adopted in the study described earlier were not met and that, as a result, it is possible that the correct conclusion could have been the opposite of that reported by the authors (e.g., deforestation decreases, rather than increasing, malaria through ecological mechanisms). Causal-inference approaches may be critical to characterize the relationship between environmental change and disease risk, but conclusions based on these methods can be even more unreliable than those from traditional methods if careful attention is not given to the plausibility of the underlying assumptions.

TI  - Tropical land use land cover mapping in Para (Brazil) using discriminative Markov random fields and multi-temporal TerraSAR-X data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
AB  - Remote sensing satellite data offer the unique possibility to map land use land cover transformations by providing spatially explicit information. However, detection of, short-term processes and land use patterns of high spatial temporal variability is a challenging task.
   We present a novel framework using multi-temporal TerraSAR-X data and machine learning techniques, namely discriminative Markov random fields with spatio-temporal priors, and import vector machines, in order to advance the mapping of land cover characterized by short-term changes. Our study region covers a current deforestation frontier in the Brazilian state Para with land cover dominated by primary forests, different types of pasture land and secondary vegetation, and land use dominated by short-term processes such as slash-and-burn activities. The data set comprises multi-temporal TerraSAR-X imagery acquired over the course of the 2014 dry season, as well as optical data (RapidEye, Landsat),for reference. Results show that land use land cover is reliably mapped, resulting in spatially adjusted overall accuracies of up to 79% in a five class setting, yet limitations for the differentiation of different pasture types remain.
   The proposed method is applicable on multi-temporal data sets, and constitutes a feasible approach to map land use land cover in regions that are affected by high-frequent temporal changes.

TI  - A new species of <i>Calonectria</i> causing leaf blight and cutting rot of three forest tree species in Brazil
T2  - TROPICAL PLANT PATHOLOGY
AB  - Several species of Calonectria cause diseases on a wide range of forest tree species that are propagated either via seedlings or rooted cuttings. In nurseries these fungi cause damping-off, cutting and root rots, stem lesions, and leaf blights. Recently a Calonectria sp. was isolated from rooted cuttings of Anadenanthera peregrina (Fabaceae), Piptadenia gonoacantha (Fabaceae), and Azadirachta indica (Meliaceae) exhibiting leaf blight and cutting rot in a forest nursery at the Universidade Federal de Vicosa, Brazil. Morphological comparisons and DNA sequences of three loci containing partial gene sequences of beta-tubulin (TUB2), calmodulin (CAL), and elongation factor (TEF-1 alpha) indicated that these isolates represent an unnamed species of Calonectria, described here as C. hodgesii sp. nov. Spray-inoculated plants of all three hosts with a suspension at 1x10(4) conidia mL(-1) induced leaf lesions, cutting rot, and intense defoliation as observed under natural conditions. Calonectria hodgesii was re-isolated from infected tissue, which fulfilled Koch's postulates and confirmed its status as a pathogen with a wide host range.

TI  - Classifying Complex Mountainous Forests with L-Band SAR and Landsat Data Integration: A Comparison among Different Machine Learning Methods in the Hyrcanian Forest
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Forest environment classification in mountain regions based on single-sensor remote sensing approaches is hindered by forest complexity and topographic effects. Temperate broadleaf forests in western Asia such as the Hyrcanian forest in northern Iran have already suffered from intense anthropogenic activities. In those regions, forests mainly extend in rough terrain and comprise different stand structures, which are difficult to discriminate. This paper explores the joint analysis of Landsat7/ETM+, L-band SAR and their derived parameters and the effect of terrain corrections to overcome the challenges of discriminating forest stand age classes in mountain regions. We also verified the performances of three machine learning methods which have recently shown promising results using multisource data; support vector machines (SVM), neural networks (NN), random forest (RF) and one traditional classifier (i.e., maximum likelihood classification (MLC)) as a benchmark. The non-topographically corrected ETM+ data failed to differentiate among different forest stand age classes (average classification accuracy (OA) = 65%). This confirms the need to reduce relief effects prior data classification in mountain regions. SAR backscattering alone cannot properly differentiate among different forest stand age classes (OA = 62%). However, textures and PolSAR features are very efficient for the separation of forest classes (OA = 82%). The highest classification accuracy was achieved by the joint usage of SAR and ETM+ (OA = 86%). However, this shows a slight improvement compared to the ETM+ classification (OA = 84%). The machine learning classifiers proved t o be more robust and accurate compared to MLC. SVM and RF statistically produced better classification results than NN in the exploitation of the considered multi-source data.

TI  - The Impacts of Landscape Changes on Annual Mean Land Surface Temperature in the Tropical Mountain City of Sri Lanka: A Case Study of Nuwara Eliya (1996-2017)
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Although urbanization has contributed to improving living conditions, it has had negative impacts on the natural environment in urbanized areas. Urbanization has changed the urban landscape and resulted in increasing land surface temperature (LST). Thus, studies related to LST in various urban environments have become popular. However, there are few LST studies focusing on mountain landscapes (i.e., hill stations). Therefore, this study investigated the changes in the landscape and their impacts on LST intensity (LSTI) in the tropical mountain city of Nuwara Eliya, Sri Lanka. The study utilized annual median temperatures extracted from Landsat data collected from 1996 to 2017 based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) interface. The fractions of built-up (BL), forested (FL) and agricultural (AL) land, were calculated using land use and cover maps based on urban-rural zone (URZ) analysis. The urban-rural margin was demarcated based on the fractions of BL (<10%), and LSTI that were measured using the mean LST difference in the urban-rural zone. Besides, the mixture of land-use types was calculated using the AL/FL and BL/FL fraction ratios, and grid-based density analysis. The results revealed that the BL in all URZs rapidly developed, while AL decreased during the period 1996 to 2017. There was a minimal change in the forest area of the Nuwara Eliya owing to the government's forest preservation policies. The mean temperature of the study area increased by 2.1 degrees C from 1996 to 2017. The magnitude of mean LST between urban-rural zones also increased from 1.0 degrees C (1996) to 3.5 degrees C (2017). The results also showed that mean LST was positively correlated with the increase and decrease of the BL/FL and AL/FL fraction ratios, respectively. The grid-based analysis showed an increasing, positive relationship between mean LST and density of BL. This indicated that BL density had been a crucial element in increasing LST in the study area. The results of this study will be a useful indicator to introduce improved landscape and urban planning in the future to minimize the negative impact of LST on urban sustainability.

During the last two decades, reports show that both viruses also infect or affect other species of the family Felidae. Human landscape perturbation is one of the main causes of emerging diseases in wild animals, facilitating contact and transmission of pathogens between domestic and wild animals. We investigated FIV and FeLV infection in free-ranging guignas (Leopardus guigna) and sympatric domestic cats in human perturbed landscapes on Chiloe Island, Chile. Samples from 78 domestic cats and 15 guignas were collected from 2008 to 2010 and analyzed by PCR amplification and sequencing. Two guignas and two domestic cats were positive for FIV; three guignas and 26 domestic cats were positive for FeLV. The high percentage of nucleotide identity of FIV and FeLV sequences from both species suggests possible interspecies transmission of viruses, facilitated by increased contact probability through human invasion into natural habitats, fragmentation of guigna habitat, and poultry attacks by guignas. This study enhances our knowledge on the transmission of pathogens from domestic to wild animals in the global scenario of human landscape perturbation and emerging diseases.

TI  - Risk Factors and the Character of Clinical Course of the <i>Echinococcus multilocularis</i> Infection in Patients in Poland
T2  - PATHOGENS
AB  - Alveolar echinococcosis (AE) is a chronic zoonotic disease caused by the larval form of Echinococcus multilocularis. In humans, it may become a serious chronic infection of the liver which resembles a slow malignant process leading to death when untreated. The aim of the study was an assessment of the risk factors of the E. multilocularis infections and the description of AE clinical course in the group of 36 patients with confirmed AE, hospitalized at the Department and Clinic of Tropical and Parasitic Diseases, Poznan University of Medical Sciences between 2013 and 2022. Among the study participants, most patients cultivated land, bred livestock, worked in the forest, or were employed in animal shelters. The E. multilocularis infection was diagnosed based on imaging and immunoassay techniques within 6 months in the majority of patients hospitalized in the Department. All patients hospitalized in the Department initiated anti-parasitic therapy at the moment of the diagnosis. Pharmacological treatment combined with surgery was applied in most of the study participants, who were presented with more advanced stages of infection. We conclude the following: 1. For humans in the risk group, regular abdominal imaging examinations and the detection of specific antibodies against E. multilocularis are recommended. 2. Regular screening tests in the hyperendemic areas of AE would increase the early detection of the disease and to improve the clinical prognosis in this extremely life-threatening parasitic disease.

TI  - Impact of deforestation and agricultural development on anopheline ecology and malaria epidemiology
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - To clarify mechanisms linking deforestation, anopheline ecology, and malaria epidemiology, this study draws together 60 examples of changes in anopheline ecology and malaria incidence as a consequence of deforestation and agricultural development. The deforestation projects were classified based on subsequent land use and were reviewed in terms of their impact on anopheline density and malaria incidence. To further examine different anopheline responses to land transformation, two major ecological characteristics of 31 anopheline species were tested for their associations with changes in their densities and malaria incidence. Although niche width of anopheline species was not associated with density changes, sun preference was significantly associated with an increase in density. This study suggests the possibility of predicting potential impacts of future deforestation on vector density by using information on types of planned agricultural development and the ecology of local anopheline species.

TI  - Pathogenic<i>Fusarium</i>species complexes associated to seeds of indigenous Brazilian forest tree<i>Aspidosperma polyneuron</i>
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PATHOLOGY
AB  - 'Peroba rosa' (Aspidosperma polyneuronMuell. Arg.) is a forest species native to Brazil, which is threatened of extinction due to intense predatory exploitation. Knowing the physiological and sanitary aspects of the seeds or seedlings of native species is essential to determine the viability of the establishment of seedlings and natural regeneration. In tropical regions such as Brazil, the susceptibility of phytopathogens in native forest species is still poorly understood. In this work, we report for the first timeFusariumspecies associated with pathogenicity inAspidosperma polyneuron.We identified a diverse group of crop pathogensFusariumspecies -F. solani, F. oxysporum, F. verticillioides, F. equiseti, F. fujikuroi, F. pseudocircinatumandF. subglutinansfrom seeds, able to cause darkening of the leaf limb of inoculated seedlings. These results provide valuable information on the pathogenic association ofFusariumwith an indigenous forest tree and possible risks these fungi might pose to the forest species.

T2  - 2010 IEEE INTERNATIONAL GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING SYMPOSIUM
CP  - 30th IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS) on Remote Sensing - Global Vision for Local Action
AB  - This paper presents a case study addressing the comparison between different SAR polarimetric mode for tropical forest stratification: Full polarimetry (FP), Dual Polarimetry (DP) and Compact Polarimetry (CP). These 2 latter modes are simulated using FP data acquired by the L band PALSAR sensor over 2 study sites. Cayenne in French Guyana and the Fazenda Sao Nicolau in Brazil. The classification approach used to evaluate each mode based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm shows the good capabilities of the FP mode to discriminate different kinds of vegetation. The choice of one DP mode that gives twice bigger swath than FP mode depends on the study classes. In this tropical environment the hh/hv existing mode seems to be a good choice and CP mode show a good alternative to all the actual DP modes.

TI  - Logging and forest edges reduce redundancy in plant-frugivore networks in an old-growth European forest
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
AB  - Seed dispersal by frugivores is the basis for regeneration of fleshy-fruited plants in forest ecosystems. Previous studies have reported a decrease in forest specialist frugivores due to logging and forest edges. Forest generalists appear less sensitive and may even increase at forest edges. Such changes in the abundance of frugivores may have consequences for consumer/resource ratios and competition in plant-frugivore networks. Optimal foraging theory predicts an increase in dietary specialization of animals at low consumer/resource ratios due to reduced competition. A decrease in forest specialists in logged forests should cause decreased consumer/resource ratios, increased dietary specialization and reduced redundancy, whereas an increased abundance of forest generalists at edges may compensate for a loss of specialists. In Europe's last old-growth lowland forest (Biaowiea, Eastern Poland), we recorded fruit removal by frugivores from fleshy-fruited plant species in the interior and at edges of logged and old-growth forests for 2 consecutive years. The abundance of forest generalists increased at forest edges, whereas specialists were unaffected. Conversely, logging resulted in a decrease in abundance of forest specialists but had no effect on the abundance of generalists. Accordingly, consumer/resource ratios increased from interior to edges and were reduced in the interior of logged forests compared with the interior of old-growth forests. As predicted by optimal foraging theory, a decrease in consumer/resource ratios coincided with increased dietary specialization and a loss of redundancy in the interior of logged forests. Despite low dietary specialization, redundancy was reduced at forest edges as forest generalists dominated plant-frugivore interactions. Synthesis. We show that a shift in frugivore assemblages at forest edges and increased dietary specialization of frugivores in the interior of logged forests involved a loss of redundancy compared with continuous old-growth forests. This suggests that seed dispersal services in secondary forest habitats depend on an impoverished subset of dispersal vectors and may suffer reduced adaptive potential to changing environmental conditions. Thus, our study highlights the value of old-growth forests for the conservation of frugivore-mediated seed dispersal processes.

TI  - The genetic diversity and cultural importance of cassava and its contribution to tropical forest sustainability
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES
AB  - Cassava has been cultivated in Central and South America for about 8000 years. Following export to Africa and Asia in the 16th-19th centuries it is now established as a vital component of the diet of many of the world's poorest people. Growth and processing of the plant in Central and South America represents one of the few remaining expressions of indigenous knowledge. This article highlights the importance of traditional methods of cultivation and processing in contributing to a large number of varieties and maintenance of high genetic diversity. Increasingly, such diversity is being supplemented by international breeding programs with the possibility of genetically modified crops to combat plant diseases and natural enemies such as cassava mosaic virus. The article examines the issues surrounding the patenting of traditional knowledge of cassava. It concludes by exploring cassava cultivation as a contribution to the sustainable utilization of species-rich tropical forests. This combines the maintenance of high genetic diversity of the crop with traditional practices of indigenous people, thereby satisfying the requirements of article 8(j) of the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity.

TI  - Forest Conservation with Deep Learning: A Deeper Understanding of Human Geography around the Betampona Nature Reserve, Madagascar
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Documenting the impacts of climate change and human activities on tropical rainforests is imperative for protecting tropical biodiversity and for better implementation of REDD+ and UN Sustainable Development Goals. Recent advances in very high-resolution satellite sensor systems (i.e., WorldView-3), computing power, and machine learning (ML) have provided improved mapping of fine-scale changes in the tropics. However, approaches so far focused on feature extraction or the extensive tuning of ML parameters, hindering the potential of ML in forest conservation mapping by not using textural information, which is found to be powerful for many applications. Additionally, the contribution of shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands in forest cover mapping is unknown. The objectives were to develop end-to-end mapping of the tropical forest using fully convolution neural networks (FCNNs) with WorldView-3 (WV-3) imagery and to evaluate human impact on the environment using the Betampona Nature Reserve (BNR) in Madagascar as the test site. FCNN (U-Net) using spatial/textural information was implemented and compared with feature-fed pixel-based methods including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Deep Neural Network (DNN). Results show that the FCNN model outperformed other models with an accuracy of 90.9%, while SVM, RF, and DNN provided accuracies of 88.6%, 84.8%, and 86.6%, respectively. When SWIR bands were excluded from the input data, FCNN provided superior performance over other methods with a 1.87% decrease in accuracy, while the accuracies of other models-SVM, RF, and DNN-decreased by 5.42%, 3.18%, and 8.55%, respectively. Spatial-temporal analysis showed a 0.7% increase in Evergreen Forest within the BNR and a 32% increase in tree cover within residential areas likely due to forest regeneration and conservation efforts. Other effects of conservation efforts are also discussed.

TI  - Using nonparametric modeling approaches and remote sensing imagery to estimate ecological welfare forest biomass
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
AB  - The spatial distribution of forest biomass is closely related with carbon cycle, climate change, forest productivity, and biodiversity. Efficient quantification of biomass provides important information about forest quality and health. With the rising awareness of sustainable development, the ecological benefits of forest biomass attract more attention compared to traditional wood supply function. In this study, two nonparametric modeling approaches, random forest (RF) and support vector machine were adopted to estimate above ground biomass (AGB) using widely used Landsat imagery in the region, especially within the ecological forest of Fuyang District in Zhejiang Province, China. Correlation analysis was accomplished and model parameters were optimized during the modeling process. As a result, the best performance modeling method RF was implemented to produce an AGB estimation map. The predicted map of AGB in the study area showed obvious spatial variability and demonstrated that within the current ecological forest zone, as well as the protected areas, the average of AGB were higher than the ordinary forest. The quantification of AGB was proven to have a close relationship with the local forest policy and management pattern, which indicated that combining remote-sensing imagery and forest biophysical property would provide considerable guidance for making beneficial decisions.

TI  - Impact of removal pitfall trapping on the community of shrews (Mammalia: Soricidae) in two African tropical forest sites.
T2  - MAMMALIA
AB  - Removal trapping is still used for the study of tropical African shrews biodiversity and ecology, because shrew species identification requires cranio-dental analyses due to the existence of sibling species. Pitfall trapping has been found to be the most effective protocol to collect shrews. However, the impact of removal pitfall-trapping on density and diversity of shrew species is still unknown. In this paper, we test this impact on two African tropical forest shrew communities, by comparing the results of two trapping sessions conducted in two consecutive years. Our results support the view that removal trapping, with conditions described in this paper, does not adversely affect local population numbers and shrew species richness.

TI  - Identification of two novel adenoviruses in smooth-billed ani and tropical screech owl
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Avian adenoviruses (AdVs) are a very diverse group of pathogens causing diseases in poultry and wild birds. Wild birds, endangered by habitat loss and habitat fragmentation in the tropical forests, are recognised to play a role in the transmission of various AdVs. In this study, two novel, hitherto unknown AdVs were described from faecal samples of smooth-billed ani and tropical screech owl. The former was classified into genus Aviadenovirus, the latter into genus Atadenovirus, and both viruses most probably represent new AdV species as well. These results show that there is very limited information about the biodiversity of AdVs in tropical wild birds, though viruses might have a major effect on the population of their hosts or endanger even domesticated animals. Surveys like this provide new insights into the diversity, evolution, host variety, and distribution of avian AdVs.

TI  - Tropical Species Classification with Structural Traits Using Handheld Laser Scanning Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Information about tree species plays a pivotal role in sustainable forest management. Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) technology has demonstrated its potential to obtain species information using the structural features of trees. Several studies have explored the structural properties of boreal or temperate trees from terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) data and applied them to species classification, but the study of structural properties of tropical trees for species classification is rare. Compared to conventional static TLS, handheld laser scanning (HLS) is able to effectively capture point clouds of an individual tree with flexible movability. Therefore, in this study, we characterized the structural features of tropical species from HLS data as 23 LiDAR structural parameters, involving 6 branch, 11 crown and 6 entire tree parameters, and used these parameters to classify the species via 5 machine-learning (ML) models, respectively. The performance of each parameter was further evaluated and compared. Classification results showed that the employed parameters can achieve a classification accuracy of 84.09% using the support vector machine with a polynomial kernel. The evaluation of parameters indicated that it is insufficient to classify four species with only one and two parameters, but ten parameters were recommended in order to achieve satisfactory accuracy. The combination of different types of parameters, such as branch and crown parameters, can significantly improve classification accuracy. Finally, five sets of optimal parameters were suggested according to their importance and performance. This study also showed that the time- and cost-efficient HLS instrument could be a promising tool for tree-structure-related studies, such as structural parameter estimation, species classification, forest inventory, as well as sustainable tree management.

TI  - Selective logging: Do rates of forest turnover in stems, species composition and functional traits decrease with time since disturbance? - A 45 year perspective
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Selective logging, the targeted harvesting of timber trees in a single cutting cycle, is globally rising in extent and intensity. Short-term impacts of selective logging on tropical forests have been widely investigated, but long-term effects on temporal dynamics of forest structure and composition are largely unknown. Understanding these long-term dynamics will help determine whether tropical forests are resilient to selective logging and inform choices between competing demands of anthropogenic use versus conservation of tropical forests. Forest dynamics can be studied within the framework of succession theory, which predicts that temporal turnover rates should decline with time since disturbance. Here, we investigated the temporal dynamics of a tropical forest in Kibale National Park, Uganda over 45 years following selective logging. We estimated turnover rates in stems, species composition, and functional traits (wood density and diameter at breast height), using observations from four censuses in 1989, 1999, 2006, and 2013, of stems >= 10 cm diameter within 17 unlogged and 9 logged 200 x 10 m vegetation plots. We used null models to account for interdependencies among turnover rates in stems, species composition, and functional traits. We tested predictions that turnover rates should be higher and decrease with increasing time since the selective logging event in logged forest, but should be less temporally variable in unlogged forest. Overall, we found higher turnover rates in logged forest for all three attributes, but turnover rates did not decline through time in logged forest and was not less temporally variable in unlogged forest. These results indicate that successional models that assume recovery to pre-disturbance conditions are inadequate for predicting the effects of selective logging on the dynamics of the tropical forest in Kibale. Selective logging resulted in persistently higher turnover rates, which may compromise the carbon storage capacity of Kibale's forest. Selective logging effects may also interact with effects from other global trends, potentially causing major long-term shifts in the dynamics of tropical forests. Similar studies in tropical forests elsewhere will help determine the generality of these conclusions. Ultimately, the view that selective logging is a benign approach to the management of tropical forests should be reconsidered in the light of studies of the effects of this practice on long-term forest dynamics.

TI  - Status of forest nursery diseases in India and emerging trends in seedling disease management
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 4TH MEETING OF IUFRO WORKING PARTY 7.03.04 - DISEASE AND INSECTS IN FOREST NURSERIES
CP  - 4th Meeting of the IUFRO Working Party 7 03 04
AB  - In India, seedlings of forestry species for large-scale planting programs are still raised by conventional methods though, rootrainer technology has been introduced very recently. Seedlings raised in conventional forest nurseries have to be maintained for a period ranging from 5 to 18 months or more depending up on the tree species, climatic conditions as well as planting techniques followed. Diseases pose major threat in forest nurseries and cause practical problems in producing disease free, healthy planting stock. Hence raising and maintaining planting stock for large-scale planting program is often risky and failures of nurseries due to outbreak of diseases are not uncommon. Forest nurseries raised in warm-humid tropical zones are more often prone to disease hazard than those in warm-temperate zones. Fungi are the most predominant nursery pathogens, while bacteria, viruses and phytoplasma cause diseases in seedlings to a lesser extent. Among the fungal pathogens, Rhizoctonia solani has emerged as the most dangerous and widespread pathogen in forest nurseries in India, causing various diseases viz. damping-off, web blight, collar rot, stem and foliage infection, root rot, etc. at different growth phases of the seedlings. Both broad-leaved and conifer species are equally vulnerable to this pathogen. Cylindrocladium is the other important nursery pathogen, which causes epiphytotics in eucalypt nurseries raised in high-rainfall areas. At least 12 species of Cylindrocladium have been reported from India associated with the seedling diseases. Sclerotium rolfsii, Fusarium, Pythium, Macrophomina, Colletotrichum, Alternaria, Phoma, Phomopsis, Dreschslera, Exserohilum, Bipolaris, etc. are the other potential pathogens in forest nurseries. Disease management in forest nurseries is at the crossroad. Due to repeated application of broad-spectrum fungicides in forest nurseries over the years, many of the pathogens exhibit resistance to pesticides. R.solani exists in different anastomosis groups with varying virulence and fungicidal resistance. Cylindrocladium species also shows resistance to carbendazim, the most effective chemical being used for decades. Recently more emphasis has been given to cultural control measures in forest nurseries viz. regulation of shade, soil water regime, microclimate, seedling density, etc. integrated with biological measures, by soil solarization and introduction of indigenous antagonistic organisms, along with prophylactic fungicidal application.

TI  - Mapping tropical forests and deciduous rubber plantations in Hainan Island, China by integrating PALSAR 25-m and multi-temporal Landsat images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
AB  - Updated and accurate maps of tropical forests and industrial plantations, like rubber plantations, are essential for understanding carbon cycle and optimal forest management practices, but existing optical imagery-based efforts are greatly limited by frequent cloud cover. Here we explored the potential utility of integrating 25-m cloud-free Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) mosaic product and multi-temporal Landsat images to map forests and rubber plantations in Hainan Island, China. Based on structure information detected by PALSAR and yearly maximum Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), we first identified and mapped forests with a producer accuracy (PA) of 96% and user accuracy (UA) of 98%. The resultant forest map showed reasonable spatial and areal agreements with the optical-based forest maps of Fine Resolution Observation and Monitoring Global Land Clover (FROM-GLC) and GlobalLand30. We then extracted rubber plantations from the forest map according to their deciduous features (using minimum Land Surface Water Index, LSWI) and rapid changes in canopies during Rubber Defoliation and Foliation (RDF) period (using standard deviation of LSWI) and dense canopy in growing season (using maximum NDVI). The rubber plantation map yielded a high accuracy when validated by ground truth-based data (PAPUA > 86%) and evaluated with three farm-scale rubber plantation maps (PA/UA > 88%). It is estimated that in 2010, Hainan Island had 2.11 x 10(6) ha of forest and 5.15 x 10(6) ha of rubber plantations. This study has demonstrated the potential of integrating 25-m PALSAR-based structure information, and Landsat-based spectral and phenology information for mapping tropical forests and rubber plantations.

TI  - Drought reduces the growth and health of tropical rainforest understory plants
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Tree saplings and shrubs are frequently overlooked components of tropical rainforest biodiversity, and it may be hypothesized that their small stature and shallow root systems predisposes them to be vulnerable to drought. However, these purported influences of drought on growth, physiological performance and plant traits on tree saplings and shrubs have yet to be studied in simulated drought conditions in the field. We simulated drought using a rainfall exclusion experiment in 0.4 ha of lowland tropical rainforest in northeast Australia in 2015. After six months, we compared the average change in aboveground biomass and plant health of drought-affected tree saplings and understory shrubs with control individuals. We also assessed photosynthetic function, plant health and leaf traits in eight target species. Both tree saplings and shrubs had significantly lower aboveground biomass in the drought treatment compared to the control. Drought-affected individuals of target species exhibited a significantly higher incidence of disease and insect attack, and reduced photosynthesis, leaf fresh mass and leaf toughness compared to control individuals. We conclude that reduced growth and photosynthetic capability, an increased susceptibility to insect attack, and leaf trait changes constitute a near immediate drought response in tropical rainforest tree saplings and shrubs. Our results show that these often-overlooked lifeforms are likely to be the most rapidly and negatively impacted component of tropical rainforest biodiversity under drought conditions.

TI  - Medicinal plants used by women from Agnalazaha littoral forest (Southeastern Madagascar)
T2  - JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY AND ETHNOMEDICINE
AB  - Background: The country of Madagascar is renowned for its high level of biodiversity and endemism, as well as the overwhelming pressures and threats placed on the natural resources by a growing population and climate change. Traditional medicine plays an important role in the daily lives of the Malagasy for various reasons including limited access to healthcare, limited markets and traditional values. The objective of this study was to assess the modern utitilization of the Agnalazaha Forest by the local population in Mahabo-Mananivo, Madagascar, for medicinal plants used by women, and to establish a list of medicinal plants used by women sourced from Agnalazaha Forest.
   Methods: Ethnobotanical studies were conducted over a period of five months in 2010 to determine the diversity of medicinal plants used by women in the commune of Mahabo-Mananivo. In all, 498 people were interviewed, both male and female ranging age from 15 to over 60 years old.
   Results: 152 medicinal plants used by local people were collected during the ethnobotanical studies. Among the recorded species, eight native species are widely used by women. These species are known for their therapeutic properties in treating placental apposition and complications during childbirth as well as tropical illnesses such as malaria, filariasis, and sexual diseases like gonorrhea and syphilis.
   Conclusions: Littoral forests are rare ecosystems that are highly threatened on the island nation of Madagascar. Our investigation into the use of medicinal plants sourced from and around the Agnalazaha Forest by the women of Mahabo-Mananivo reinforces the need for this natural resource as a first line of health care for rural families.

TI  - Temporal variation in fungal communities associated with tropical hummingbirds and nectarivorous bats
T2  - FUNGAL ECOLOGY
AB  - Species of yeasts and other microfungi carried by pollinators are of general ecological interest because some of these microbial species can grow in floral nectar and affect plant-pollinator interactions. It is, however, not well understood how the composition of fungal species found on pollinators varies over space or time. The spatial and temporal distribution patterns in the microfungi found on the bills of hummingbirds and in the mouths of nectarivorous bats was investigated along a gradient of deforestation within a Costa Rican countryside landscape. The community composition of microfungi found on hummingbirds' bills and bats' mouths underwent substantial compositional turnover over a 2-month period and between 2 yr. In contrast, fungal community composition was not significantly correlated with spatial distance, habitat type, species of hummingbirds, nor the forest dependency of the hummingbirds sampled for microfungi. These findings suggest that, in this landscape, fungal communities on a nectarivous vertebrate vector might be influenced primarily by temporal factors such as plant and flower phenology rather than spatial environmental heterogeneity.

TI  - Assessing the cascading effects of management and landscape on the arthropod guilds occurring in papaya plantations
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Arthropods can provide ecosystem services or disservices to agricultural systems. Whereas herbivores can cause substantial crop losses, natural enemies can offer pest regulation services that otherwise would be difficult to obtain. Two major factors affecting arthropod communities within plantations are farming practices and surrounding landscape. Previous studies have shown that natural enemies are less abundant in plantations within simplified landscapes and intense management practices, while herbivores do not always respond to these factors. Given the different roles of arthropods in plantations, we assessed the cascading effects that the surrounding landscape and different management practices can have on different arthropod guilds in papaya plantations, ultimately affecting plant damage and fruit production. A piecewise structural equation model was used to assess the direct and indirect effects of management practices and landscape upon herbivores and their natural enemies, and their cascading effects on papaya leaf damage and fruit production. We studied 11 papaya plantations in the surroundings of a tropical dry forest (TDF) in Jalisco, Mexico. The model indicated that there is a decrease of natural enemies with intensive conventional management, which had no effect on pest abundance. Furthermore, surrounding landscape had an effect on pest abundance and not on predators, but this effect was different between seasons. Even when pest abundance explained crop damage, this was not reflected on fruit production. Crop yield was explained by management practices, available phosphorus in soil and by the abundance of natural enemies.

TI  - The Lethal Fungus <i>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</i> Is Present in Lowland Tropical Forests of Far Eastern Panama
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - The fungal disease chytridiomycosis, caused by Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), is one of the main causes of amphibian population declines and extinctions all over the world. In the Neotropics, this fungal disease has caused catastrophic declines in the highlands as it has spread throughout Central America down to Panama. In this study, we determined the prevalence and intensity of Bd infection in three species of frogs in one highland and four lowland tropical forests, including two lowland regions in eastern Panama in which the pathogen had not been detected previously. Bd was present in all the sites sampled with a prevalence ranging from 15-34%, similar to other Neotropical lowland sites. The intensity of Bd infection on individual frogs was low, ranging from average values of 0.11-24 zoospore equivalents per site. Our work indicates that Bd is present in anuran communities in lowland Panama, including the Darien province, and that the intensity of the infection may vary among species from different habitats and with different life histories. The population-level consequences of Bd infection in amphibian communities from the lowlands remain to be determined. Detailed studies of amphibian species from the lowlands will be essential to determine the reason why these species are persisting despite the presence of the pathogen.

TI  - Host evolutionary history rather than avian functional traits drives the <i>Plasmodium</i> regional assembly in the Atlantic Forest
T2  - FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY
AB  - Disentangling the influence of hosts and environmental factors in parasite community assembly is one of the main challenges in disease ecology. Here we used three approaches to assess the influence of host ecology and evolutionary history, as well as environmental factors on Plasmodium parasite composition within the Atlantic Forest. Using sampling data of 2,241 bird individuals captured within the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, we first calculated the functional and phylogenetic host specificity of Plasmodium lineages. We then tested whether host functional or phylogenetic distance predicts Plasmodium taxonomic and phylogenetic beta diversity among host species. Finally, we tested whether temperature, precipitation, landscape dissimilarity and host turnover (taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic) determine Plasmodium taxonomic and phylogenetic turnover among 13 localities within the Atlantic Forest. We found that 47% of the parasite lineages were more phylogenetic specialists than expected by chance. In addition, both taxonomic and phylogenetic Plasmodium beta diversity were associated with host phylogenetic distance, indicating that closely related avian species are infected by assemblages composed of more closely related Plasmodium lineages. When comparing Plasmodium lineage community among localities, we found host phylogenetic turnover as the most relevant predictor of Plasmodium taxonomic and phylogenetic turnover. On the other hand, environmental variables explained 23% of Plasmodium taxonomic turnover among localities, suggesting that lineage composition is affected by climate and landscape, especially temperature seasonality. Combining all results, our findings suggest host phylogeny is the main driver of the regional Plasmodium assemblages within the Atlantic Forest.

T2  - MEMORIAS DO INSTITUTO OSWALDO CRUZ
AB  - A study about the horizontal stratification of the sand fly fauna in two distinct ecosystems, caatinga area, endemic for visceral leishmaniasis, and the tropical rain forest area, endemic for cutaneous leishmaniasis, was performed in the state of Bahia, Brazil. Lutzomyia longipalpis was predominant in the caatinga, and following it came the species L. capixaba and L. oswaldoi. In the tropical rain forest other species were found, such as L. intermedia, L. migonei, L. whitmani, L. yuilli, L.fischeri, L. damascenoi, L. evandroi, L. monticola, and L. lenti. It was found that the geographical limits of the vector species of visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis are clearly defined by the biological and phytogeographic characteristics.

TI  - Contrasting flow pathways within tropical forest slopes of Ultisol soils
T2  - EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS
AB  - There are very few experimental studies identifying hydrological pathways within rain forest slopes. Such knowledge is, however, necessary to understand why forest disturbance affects rainfall-riverflow response and nutrient migration. This study examines flow pathways within lowland rain forest slopes comprising Udults of the Ultisol soil order. Experimentation was conducted on four SE Asian hillslope units (each 5 x 5 m in plan) in the Bukit Timah catchment (Singapore Island), and in the W8S5 catchment (Sabah, Borneo Island). The flow pathways were identified by artificial tracer experiments. We evaluated how well hydrometric calculations based on tensiometry and permeametry measurements predicted the tracer patterns.
   The tracer work indicated much faster subsurface flows at Bukit Timah than W8S5 for the storms studied. Some explanation of the greater subsurface waterflows at Bukit Timah in comparison to W8S5 is afforded by the less steep moisture release curves which maintain hydraulic conductivity as the soil dries. Vertical flow of the tracer through the upper 1 m of soil predominated (> 90 per cent of percolation) in the Bukit Timah slopes. In some contrast, a major component (approximately 60 per cent) of the tracer percolation was directed laterally within the W8S5 slopes. The flow vectors calculated using the hydrometric methods did, however, grossly under-estimate the degree of lateral deflection of waterflow generated at W8S5 and to a lesser extent over-estimated it at Bukit Timah. In part, these errors may relate to the inability of traditional hydrometric techniques to fully characterize the effect of the large and small 'natural soil pipes' present within both catchments. In conclusion, the study indicates that marked variations in flow vectors exist within the Udult great group of SE Asian soils and hydrometric calculations may be poor predictors of these dominant pathways.

TI  - Interactions between ants, fruits and seeds in a restinga forest in south-eastern Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY
AB  - Fleshy diaspores (fruits, seeds) comprise a large portion of the litter on the floor of tropical forests, and interactions involving litter-foraging ants and diaspores are common in these areas. In this study, the interactions between ants and non-myrmecochorous diaspores (i.e. not adapted to dispersal by ants) were surveyed along a 1.4-km transect in a restinga forest (sandy soil) on the coast of south-eastern Brazil. During 2 y of monthly samplings, 562 interactions involving 48 ant species and 44 species of diaspore (0.02-11.10 g) were recorded. Ant-diaspore associations involved a considerable part of the ground-dwelling ant community. Large ponerine ants individually removed the diaspores up to 13 m, whereas small ants (myrmicines) normally recruited workers and consumed the diaspore on the spot. Ant-derived benefits to diaspores of non-myrmecochorous plants included secondary dispersal (small to medium-sized diaspores), and increased germination success after seed cleaning by ants. Large ponerine ants such as Odontomachus chelifer and Pachycondyla striata were the main seed vectors. Seedlings of three species were associated with nests of O. chelifer. The results indicate that ants play an important role in fruit/seed biology in the restinga forest.

TI  - Evaluating SAR polarization modes at L-band for forest classification purposes in Eastern Amazon, Brazil
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
AB  - Single, interferometric dual, and quad-polarization mode data were evaluated for the characterization and classification of seven land use classes in an area with shifting cultivation practices located in the Eastern Amazon (Brazil). The Advanced Land-Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) data were acquired during a six month interval. A clear-sky Landsat-5/TM image acquired at the same period was used as additional ground reference and as ancillary input data in the classification scheme. We evaluated backscattering intensity, polarimetric features, interferometric coherence and texture parameters for classification purposes using support vector machines (SVM) and feature selection. Results showed that the forest classes were characterized by low temporal backscattering intensity variability, low coherence and high entropy. Quad polarization mode performed better than dual and single polarizations but overall accuracies remain low and were affected by precipitation events on the date and prior SAR date acquisition. Misclassifications were reduced by integrating Landsat data and an overall accuracy of 85% was attained. The integration of Landsat to both quad and dual polarization modes showed similarity at the 5% significance level. SVM was not affected by SAR dimensionality and feature selection technique reveals that co-polarized channels as well as SAR derived parameters such as Alpha-Entropy decomposition were important ranked features after Landsat' near-infrared and green bands. We show that in absence of Landsat data, polarimetric features extracted from quad-polarization L-band increase classification accuracies when compared to single and dual polarization alone. We argue that the joint analysis of SAR and their derived parameters with optical data performs even better and thus encourage the further development of joint techniques under the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD) mechanism.

T2  - PARASITOLOGY
CP  - British-Society-for-Parasitology (BSP) Autumn Symposium on The Multidisciplinarity of Parasitology - Host-Parasite Evolution in an Ever Changing World
AB  - The drive to control neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) has had many successes but to reach defined targets new approaches are required. Over the last decade, NTD control programmes have benefitted from increased resources, and from effective partnerships and long-term pharmaceutical donations. Although the NTD agenda is broader than those diseases of parasitic aetiology there has been a massive up-scaling of the delivery of medicines to some billion people annually. Recipients are often the poorest, with the aspiration that NTD programmes are key to universal health coverage as reflected within the 2030 United Nations sustainable development goals (SDGs). To reach elimination targets, the community will need to adapt global events and changing policy environments to ensure programmes are responsive and can sustain progress towards NTD targets. Innovative thinking embedded within regional and national health systems is needed. Policy makers, managers and frontline health workers are the mediators between challenge and change at global and local levels. This paper attempts to address the challenges to end the chronic pandemic of NTDs and achieve the SDG targets. It concludes with a conceptual framework that illustrates the interactions between these key challenges and opportunities and emphasizes the health system as a critical mediator.

TI  - SHORT-TERM EXTERNAL EFFECTS OF INCREMENT CORING ON SOME TROPICAL TREES
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL FOREST SCIENCE
AB  - The invasive technique of increment coring may be unavoidable in forest ecology research requiring data on wood traits. Despite this, no study has examined the effects of increment coring on tropical forest trees. We cored 35 trees of 11 species from nine families, with wood densities ranging from 0.30 to 0.69 g cm(-3), at two sites in Singapore. Tree survival, borehole closure and external signs of damage resulting directly from the coring were monitored for 1 year. Tree radial growth was estimated from changes in diameter at breast height. Of the cored trees, only one died after 1 year. Twenty-five out of the 35 trees had at least one closed borehole, and the median time to closure was 10 months. The species of tree cored was the only significant predictor of borehole closure. We observed three main categories of external damage: discoloured bark, surface wounds and the presence of fungal fruiting bodies or insects within the boreholes. Changes in the trunk diameter were not significantly different between cored and uncored trees. Our results suggest that increment coring in the tropics does not negatively impact the survival and growth of some species of tropical forest trees within the first year after coring.

TI  - Pollen and seed dispersal among dispersed plants
T2  - BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS
AB  - The ecological significance of spacing among plants in contributing to the maintenance of species richness, particularly in tropical forests, has received considerable attention that has largely focussed on distance- and density-dependent seed and seedling mortality. More recently it has become apparent that plant spacing is also relevant to pollination, which often constrains seed production. While seed and seedling survival is reduced at high conspecific densities, pollination success, by contrast, is positively correlated to local conspecific density. Distance-dependent mechanisms acting on pollination and seed production have now been described for a variety of plants, with relatively isolated plants or fragmented populations generally suffering reduced fecundity due to pollen limitation. Yet there is considerable variability in the vulnerability of plant species to pollination failure, which may be a function of breeding system, life history, the pollination vector, the degree of specialisation among plants and their pollinators, and other indirect effects of habitat change acting on plants or pollinators. As reduced tree densities and population fragmentation are common outcomes of anthropogenically altered landscapes, understanding how pollination processes are affected in such degraded landscapes can inform effective conservation and management of remaining natural areas.

TI  - Mapping cashew monocultures in the Western Ghats using optical and radar imagery in Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Tropical deforestation is increasingly driven by the expansion of agricultural commodity produc-tion. Mapping commodity crops is an important step towards monitoring commodity-driven de-forestation. Advances in remote sensing technology, such as the availability of high-resolution imagery and the combination of optical and radar imagery have enabled the detection of the tree-like crops which are difficult to distinguish from forest cover. Cashew is an example of a tree-like crop that grows in areas with high forest cover and biodiversity. Cashew is reported to occupy similar to 7.1 million ha globally yet mapping it has been constrained by unclear boundaries due to spatial mixing with forests, an indistinct spectral signature, and structural composition that resembles forests. We employed optical, radar, and a combination of the two imagery types to detect and map cashew monocultures in south Maharashtra, India for 2020. We performed a land cover clas-sification on Google Earth Engine using Random Forest, Classification And Regression Trees and Support Vector Machine algorithms. The combination of Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 SAR imagery using Random Forest algorithm yielded the highest unbiased overall accuracy (83%) and unbi-ased producer's and user's accuracies of 71% and 86% respectively for cashew land cover and was considered the best approach. According to our best approach, monoculture cashew plantations occupy 53,350.37 ha of total land area in the Sawantwadi-Dodamarg landscape in India. This study shows that a combination of optical and radar imagery can be used for cashew land cover classification in the Western Ghats, and future studies could modify these methods for cashew mapping in other landscapes. This study contributes to a growing body of literature supporting the use of both optical and radar imagery for detecting tree-like crop cover.

TI  - Tree Species Classification in a Highly Diverse Subtropical Forest Integrating UAV-Based Photogrammetric Point Cloud and Hyperspectral Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - The use of remote sensing data for tree species classification in tropical forests is still a challenging task, due to their high floristic and spectral diversity. In this sense, novel sensors on board of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platforms are a rapidly evolving technology that provides new possibilities for tropical tree species mapping. Besides the acquisition of high spatial and spectral resolution images, UAV-hyperspectral cameras operating in frame format enable to produce 3D hyperspectral point clouds. This study investigated the use of UAV-acquired hyperspectral images and UAV-photogrammetric point cloud (PPC) for classification of 12 major tree species in a subtropical forest fragment in Southern Brazil. Different datasets containing hyperspectral visible/near-infrared (VNIR) bands, PPC features, canopy height model (CHM), and other features extracted from hyperspectral data (i.e., texture, vegetation indices-VIs, and minimum noise fraction-MNF) were tested using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The results showed that the use of VNIR hyperspectral bands alone reached an overall accuracy (OA) of 57% (Kappa index of 0.53). Adding PPC features to the VNIR hyperspectral bands increased the OA by 11%. The best result was achieved combining VNIR bands, PPC features, CHM, and VIs (OA of 72.4% and Kappa index of 0.70). When only the CHM was added to VNIR bands, the OA increased by 4.2%. Among the hyperspectral features, besides all the VNIR bands and the two VIs (NDVI and PSSR), the first four MNF features and the textural mean of 565 and 679 nm spectral bands were pointed out as more important to discriminate the tree species according to Jeffries-Matusita (JM) distance. The SVM method proved to be a good classifier for the tree species recognition task, even in the presence of a high number of classes and a small dataset.

TI  - Monitoring mangrove forest dynamics of the Sundarbans in Bangladesh and India using multi-temporal satellite data from 1973 to 2000
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
AB  - Mangrove forests in many parts of the world are declining at an alarming rate - possibly even more rapidly than inland tropical forests. The rate and causes of such changes are not known. The forests themselves are dynamic in nature and are undergoing constant changes due to both natural and anthropogenic forces. Our research objective was to monitor deforestation and degradation arising from both natural and anthropogenic forces. We analyzed multi-temporal satellite data from 1970s, 1990s, and 2000s using supervised classification approach. Our spatiotemporal analysis shows that despite having the highest population density in the world in its periphery, areal extent of the mangrove forest of the Sundarbans has not changed significantly (approximately 1.2%) in the last -25 years. The forest is however constantly changing due to erosion, aggradation, deforestation and mangrove rehabilitation programs. The net forest area increased by 1.4% from the 1970s to 1990 and decreased by 2.5% from 1990 to 2000. The change is insignificant in the context of classification errors and the dynamic nature of mangrove forests. This is an excellent example of the co-existence of humans with terrestrial and aquatic plant and animal life. The strong commitment of governments under various protection measures such as forest reserves, wildlife sanctuaries, national parks, and international designations, is believed to be responsible for keeping this forest relatively intact (at least in terms of area). While the measured net loss of mangrove forest is not that high, the change matrix shows that turnover due to erosion, aggradation, reforestation and deforestation was much greater than net change. The forest is under threat from natural and anthropogenic forces leading to forest degradation, primarily due to top-dying disease and over-exploitation of forest resources. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - EFFECTS OF PANSHARPENING METHODS ON DISCRIMINATION OF TROPICAL CROP AND FOREST USING VERY HIGH-RESOLUTION SATELLITE IMAGERY
T2  - IGARSS 2018 - 2018 IEEE INTERNATIONAL GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING SYMPOSIUM
CP  - 38th IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)
AB  - This paper assesses the effect of pansharpening process in classification of tropical crop and forest areas. Supervised classifications based on Support Vector Machine were adopted. Different pansharpening methods using bilinear interpolation technique have been used to merge very high spatial resolution Quickbird multispectral and panchromatic imagery. To develop this study, seven sub-areas were extracted and human segmentations data were created. The quantitative results based on the mean of Probabilistic Rand Index, Variation of Information and Global Consistency Error, computed for all sub-areas, showed similar results by using (0.92, 0.87, 0.87, 1.23, 0,2 respectively) and by not applying (0.93, 0.89, 0.86, 1.23, 0.21 respectively) pansharpening methods.

TI  - Terabase-Scale Coassembly of a Tropical Soil Microbiome
T2  - MICROBIOLOGY SPECTRUM
AB  - Petabases of reads are being produced by environmental metagenome sequencing. An essential step in analyzing these data is metagenome assembly, the computational reconstruction of genome sequences from microbial communities. "Coassembly" of metagenomic sequence data, in which multiple samples are assembled together, enables more complete detection of microbial genomes in an environment than "multiassembly," in which samples are assembled individually.
   Petabases of environmental metagenomic data are publicly available, presenting an opportunity to characterize complex environments and discover novel lineages of life. Metagenome coassembly, in which many metagenomic samples from an environment are simultaneously analyzed to infer the underlying genomes' sequences, is an essential tool for achieving this goal. We applied MetaHipMer2, a distributed metagenome assembler that runs on supercomputing clusters, to coassemble 3.4 terabases (Tbp) of metagenome data from a tropical soil in the Luquillo Experimental Forest (LEF), Puerto Rico. The resulting coassembly yielded 39 high-quality (>90% complete, <5% contaminated, with predicted 23S, 16S, and 5S rRNA genes and >= 18 tRNAs) metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), including two from the candidate phylum Eremiobacterota. Another 268 medium-quality (>= 50% complete, <10% contaminated) MAGs were extracted, including the candidate phyla Dependentiae, Dormibacterota, and Methylomirabilota. In total, 307 medium- or higher-quality MAGs were assigned to 23 phyla, compared to 294 MAGs assigned to nine phyla in the same samples individually assembled. The low-quality (<50% complete, <10% contaminated) MAGs from the coassembly revealed a 49% complete rare biosphere microbe from the candidate phylum FCPU426 among other low-abundance microbes, an 81% complete fungal genome from the phylum Ascomycota, and 30 partial eukaryotic MAGs with >= 10% completeness, possibly representing protist lineages. A total of 22,254 viruses, many of them low abundance, were identified. Estimation of metagenome coverage and diversity indicates that we may have characterized >= 87.5% of the sequence diversity in this humid tropical soil and indicates the value of future terabase-scale sequencing and coassembly of complex environments.IMPORTANCE Petabases of reads are being produced by environmental metagenome sequencing. An essential step in analyzing these data is metagenome assembly, the computational reconstruction of genome sequences from microbial communities. "Coassembly" of metagenomic sequence data, in which multiple samples are assembled together, enables more complete detection of microbial genomes in an environment than "multiassembly," in which samples are assembled individually. To demonstrate the potential for coassembling terabases of metagenome data to drive biological discovery, we applied MetaHipMer2, a distributed metagenome assembler that runs on supercomputing clusters, to coassemble 3.4 Tbp of reads from a humid tropical soil environment. The resulting coassembly, its functional annotation, and analysis are presented here. The coassembly yielded more, and phylogenetically more diverse, microbial, eukaryotic, and viral genomes than the multiassembly of the same data. Our resource may facilitate the discovery of novel microbial biology in tropical soils and demonstrates the value of terabase-scale metagenome sequencing.

TI  - Parasite associations predict infection risk: incorporating co-infections in predictive models for neglected tropical diseases
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
AB  - BackgroundSchistosomiasis and infection by soil-transmitted helminths are some of the world's most prevalent neglected tropical diseases. Infection by more than one parasite (co-infection) is common and can contribute to clinical morbidity in children. Geostatistical analyses of parasite infection data are key for developing mass drug administration strategies, yet most methods ignore co-infections when estimating risk. Infection status for multiple parasites can act as a useful proxy for data-poor individual-level or environmental risk factors while avoiding regression dilution bias. Conditional random fields (CRF) is a multivariate graphical network method that opens new doors in parasite risk mapping by (i) predicting co-infections with high accuracy; (ii) isolating associations among parasites; and (iii) quantifying how these associations change across landscapes.MethodsWe built a spatial CRF to estimate infection risks for Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura, hookworms (Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus) and Schistosoma mansoni using data from a national survey of Rwandan schoolchildren. We used an ensemble learning approach to generate spatial predictions by simulating from the CRF's posterior distribution with a multivariate boosted regression tree that captured non-linear relationships between predictors and covariance in infection risks. This CRF ensemble was compared against single parasite gradient boosted machines to assess each model's performance and prediction uncertainty.ResultsParasite co-infections were common, with 19.57% of children infected with at least two parasites. The CRF ensemble achieved higher predictive power than single-parasite models by improving estimates of co-infection prevalence at the individual level and classifying schools into World Health Organization treatment categories with greater accuracy. The CRF uncovered important environmental and demographic predictors of parasite infection probabilities. Yet even after capturing demographic and environmental risk factors, the presences or absences of other parasites were strong predictors of individual-level infection risk. Spatial predictions delineated high-risk regions in need of anthelminthic treatment interventions, including areas with higher than expected co-infection prevalence.ConclusionsMonitoring studies routinely screen for multiple parasites, yet statistical models generally ignore this multivariate data when assessing risk factors and designing treatment guidelines. Multivariate approaches can be instrumental in the global effort to reduce and eventually eliminate neglected helminth infections in developing countries.

TI  - Towards the invasion of wild and rural forested areas in Gabon (Central Africa) by the Asian tiger mosquito <i>Aedes albopictus</i>: Potential risks from the one health perspective
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - BackgroundSince its first record in urban areas of Central-Africa in the 2000s, the invasive mosquito, Aedes albopictus, has spread throughout the region, including in remote villages in forested areas, causing outbreaks of Aedes-borne diseases, such as dengue and chikungunya. Such invasion might enhance Ae. albopictus interactions with wild animals in forest ecosystems and favor the spillover of zoonotic arboviruses to humans.The aim of this study was to monitor Ae. albopictus spread in the wildlife reserve of La Lope National Park (Gabon), and evaluate the magnitude of the rainforest ecosystem colonization. MethodologyFrom 2014 to 2018, we used ovitraps, larval surveys, BG-Sentinel traps, and human landing catches along an anthropization gradient from La Lope village to the natural forest in the Park. ConclusionsWe detected Ae. albopictus in gallery forest up to 15 km away from La Lope village. However, Ae. albopictus was significantly more abundant at anthropogenic sites than in less anthropized areas. The number of eggs laid by Ae. albopictus decreased progressively with the distance from the forest fringe up to 200m inside the forest. Our results suggested that in forest ecosystems, high Ae. albopictus density is mainly observed at interfaces between anthropized and natural forested environments. Additionally, our data suggested that Ae. albopictus may act as a bridge vector of zoonotic pathogens between wild and anthropogenic compartments.
   Author summarySince its first record in urban areas of Central Africa in the 2000s, the anthropophilic and invasive mosquito, Aedes albopictus, has continued to spread across remote rural areas and has promoted outbreaks of Aedes-borne diseases, such as dengue, chikungunya and Zika. Such invasion might enhance Ae. albopictus interactions with wild animals in forests neighboring villages and favor the spillover of zoonotic arboviruses to humans.In this study, we reported the sustained spread of the Ae. albopictus in the wildlife reserve of La Lope National Park (LNP, Gabon), and we evaluated the magnitude of its colonization of this rainforest ecosystem. Using various sampling methods between 2014 and 2018, we detected Ae. albopictus presence in wild forest galleries up to 15 km away from La Lope, the main inhabited village within the park limits. We demonstrated that Ae. albopictus can invade forest ecosystems where the human presence is low or absent. These data indicate that Ae. albopictus may interact with wild animals and act as a bridge vector of zoonotic pathogens between the wild and anthropogenic compartments. However, our results showed that Ae. albopictus population density is higher at interfaces between the village and the forest. This suggests that this species might be present at the interface between anthropized and wild environments where the probability of contact with wild animals is increased, and consequently the likelihood of contributing to sylvatic and bridge transmission of pathogens. Our results also suggested that the presence of humans facilitates the colonization of natural forested habitat by this invasive species.

TI  - Ecological genomics of tropical trees: how local population size and allelic diversity of resistance genes relate to immune responses, cosusceptibility to pathogens, and negative density dependence
T2  - MOLECULAR ECOLOGY
AB  - In tropical forests, rarer species show increased sensitivity to species-specific soil pathogens and more negative effects of conspecific density on seedling survival (NDD). These patterns suggest a connection between ecology and immunity, perhaps because small population size disproportionately reduces genetic diversity of hyperdiverse loci such as immunity genes. In an experiment examining seedling roots from six species in one tropical tree community, we found that smaller populations have reduced amino acid diversity in pathogen resistance (R) genes but not the transcriptome in general. Normalized R gene amino acid diversity varied with local abundance and prior measures of differences in sensitivity to conspecific soil and NDD. After exposure to live soil, species with lower R gene diversity had reduced defence gene induction, more cosusceptibility of maternal cohorts to colonization by potentially pathogenic fungi, reduced root growth arrest (an R gene-mediated response) and their root-associated fungi showed lower induction of self-defence (antioxidants). Local abundance was not related to the ability to induce immune responses when pathogen recognition was bypassed by application of salicylic acid, a phytohormone that activates defence responses downstream of R gene signalling. These initial results support the hypothesis that smaller local tree populations have reduced R gene diversity and recognition-dependent immune responses, along with greater cosusceptibility to species-specific pathogens that may facilitate disease transmission and NDD. Locallyrare species may be less able to increase their equilibrium abundance without genetic boosts to defencevia immigration of novel R gene alleles from a larger and more diverse regional population.

TI  - Atlantic Tropical Cyclone Rapid Intensification Probabilistic Forecasts from an Ensemble of Machine Learning Methods
T2  - COMPLEX ADAPTIVE SYSTEMS CONFERENCE WITH THEME: ENGINEERING CYBER PHYSICAL SYSTEMS, CAS
CP  - Complex Adaptive Systems Conference on Engineering Cyber Physical Systems (CAS)
AB  - Atlantic tropical cyclone (TC) rapid intensification (RI) continues to be a major forecasting challenge, with forecast skill scores only about 15% better than climatology. To date, RI forecasts have been completed using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) on predictors optimized for RI forecasts, and no study has directly addressed machine learning's (hereafter AI) capability in forecasting RI. As such, the objective of this study is to quantify the RI predictability using proxy forecast model data and an ensemble of AI methods to generate probabilistic RI forecasts. Atlantic RI events from 1985 to 2011 were retained for all valid times (over water) for each TC, and these cases were used to train an AI ensemble optimized (through three steps) for RI prediction. First, backwards elimination feature selection was used on a blend of the proxy forecast data, predictors from the currently utilized LDA model, and observed TC track information (such as intensity and position) to optimize the predictor suite. Second, numerous configurations of three AI methods (support vector machines [SVMs], artificial neural networks [ANNs], and random forests [RFs]) were tested using bootstrap-based cross-validation to ascertain the best configurations of each AI method. Finally, the best AI configurations were used to generate probabilistic output for RI, weighted by each ensemble member's individual cross-validation performance. Resulting probabilistic forecasts were in line with the current LDA method, though the upper skill limit of the ensemble exceeded 30% improvement over climatology, which far exceeds the current LDA scheme.

TI  - Forest health in plantation forests in South-East Asia
T2  - AUSTRALASIAN PLANT PATHOLOGY
AB  - In South-East Asia, forest plantations are increasingly important sources of industrial wood for the future, thereby indirectly playing a role in the conservation of natural forest resources. Exotic species are mostly being planted with the expectation of harvest after 15 years or earlier. Their growth rates have generally been encouraging, and some species have performed surprisingly well on poor sites. With the large-scale establishment of these species, several disease problems have emerged, some with the potential to reduce plantation productivity and value of the timber. Eucalypts are the most widely grown exotic plantation species in South-East Asia followed by acacias and teak. The main disease threats to eucalypts are stem cankers and leaf and shoot blight diseases. Acacia auriculiformis and A. mangium are the most popular species of tropical acacias. A phyllode rust. heart rot and root rot are the most serious threats to these plantations. Although a number of diseases have been reported from teak, presently none appear to be particularly threatening. The most significant disease of tropical pines is a needle blight whereas a blister bark disease is the most serious threat to the two main species of casuarinas grown in South-East Asia, i.e. C. equisetifolia and C, junghuhniana. Paraserianthes falcataria, a fast-growing legume is also popular but the success of these these plantations may be limited by pink disease and a gall rust. Options for management of these disease threats are discussed.

TI  - Seasonal dynamics in leaf viromes of grapevines depicting leafroll syndrome under tropical condition
T2  - TROPICAL PLANT PATHOLOGY
AB  - Among the grapevine viral diseases, grapevine leafroll disease (GLD) complex is widespread and causes huge economic losses worldwide. The disease is incited by several viruses referred as grapevine leafroll-associated viruses (GLRaVs), either individually or in combinations. Conventional ELISA and real-time PCR assays have shown the seasonal fluctuation in GLRaV titers in temperate and sub-tropical regions. The present study employed next-generation sequencing (NGS) of ribo-depleted total RNA pool to study seasonal fluctuations in the entire viral population of two grapevine cultivars grown in Pune, India, which showed leafroll syndrome and were collected during September 2019, December 2019, and March 2020. Grapevine leafroll-associated virus 3 (GLRaV-3) was found to be the predominant GLRaV in both the cultivars. Besides, 11 grapevine viruses/viroids and two mycoviruses were identified among which grapevine polerovirus 1 (GPoV-1) was reported for the first time in India. In total, 33 viral/viroidal genomes were recovered across seasons and cultivars. Relative titers of grapevine fleck virus and grapevine virus L were validated in cvs. Fantasy Seedless and Manjari Medika, through real-time PCR assays, respectively, while GLRaV-3 titer was determined in both the cultivars. In general, viral titers including GLRaV-3 were lower in December and higher in September and March and this corresponded to the observed symptoms. However, the viroidal titers during December were similar to that of September/March. Based on the results, leaf sampling during September and March is suggested for reliable detection of grapevine viruses in tropical regions.

TI  - Utilization of Sugarcane Habitat by Feral Pig (<i>Sus scrofa</i>) in Northern Tropical Queensland: Evidence from the Stable Isotope Composition of Hair
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Feral pigs (Sus scrofa) are an invasive species that disrupt ecosystem functioning throughout their introduced range. In tropical environments, feral pigs are associated with predation and displacement of endangered species, modification of habitat, and act as a vector for the spread of exotic vegetation and disease. Across many parts of their introduced range, the diet of feral pigs is poorly known. Although the remote location and difficult terrain of far north Queensland makes observing feral pig behavior difficult, feral pigs are perceived to seek refuge in World Heritage tropical rainforests and seasonally 'crop raid' into lowland sugarcane crops. Thus, identifying how feral pigs are using different components of the landscape is important to the design of management strategies. We used the stable isotope composition of captured feral pigs to determine the extent of rainforest and sugarcane habitat usage. Recently grown hair (basal hair) from feral pigs captured in remote rainforest indicated pigs met their dietary needs solely within this habitat. Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope values of basal hair from feral pigs captured near sugarcane plantations were more variable, with some individuals estimated to consume over 85% of their diet within a sugarcane habitat, while a few consumed as much as 90% of their diet from adjacent forested environments. We estimated whether feral pigs switch habitats by sequentially sampling delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of long tail hair from a subset of seven captured animals, and demonstrate that four of these individuals moved between habitats. Our results indicate that feral pigs utilize both sugarcane and forest habitats, and can switch between these resources.

TI  - Reproductive adaptations and the availability of pollinating vectors in white Indian teak (<i>Gmelina</i> <i>arborea</i> Roxb.) in tropical rain forest of Indo-Burma Hotspot
T2  - TREES FORESTS AND PEOPLE
AB  - For the effective management of economically and ecologically valuable tree species, it is crucial to understand pollination and resource allocation particularly in biotic pollinated species. Gmelina arborea Roxb. growing in moist tropical forest of Indo-Burma region has high economic value for the pulp and paper, quality timber, medicines and a valuable component of agroforestry systems. We studied floral morphology, pollinating vectors and the reproductive potential of the species in natural forest during the flowering and fruiting seasons (March-June) of the years 2012 and 2013, which covered about one month period in each year. Floral morphometric traits, pollinating vectors, pollination and fruit formation were observed during the flowering season on ten randomly selected individuals within the population. Floral characters exhibited strong adaptations towards entomophily with emerging adaptation towards ornithophily. G arborea flowers were mainly visited by two legitimate functional groups of pollinators' i.e. insects (e.g. Xylocopa violacea, Amegilla cingulata, Mylabris pustulata) and five birds species belonging to 2 families of order Passeriformes. Additionally, one species of squirrel (Callosciurus pygerthus) was noted to legitimately foraging the flowers. Xylocopa violacea ascertained highest visiting frequency over other pollinators. Xylcopa bee also exhibited high level of functional synchronization with floral morphology of G. arborea and ascertained as most important pollinator in the study region. However, long billed trait of passerines birds were important determinant for the bird species to act as potential pollinators in the species. Ornithophilic adaptation in G. arborea is key feature of the species to attract the birds and facilitates reproductive effort. There is significant role of both flower and pollen production (resource allocation) and availability of pollinating vectors (pollination limitation) in reproductive success. G. arborea shall be vital for insects and birds conservation through providing floral resources in natural forest and agroforestry land setting.

TI  - Combining optical and microwave remote sensing for assessing gullies in human-disturbed vegetated landscapes
T2  - CATENA
AB  - The accurate assessment of the gully is key to stopping soil loss, especially in agricultural landscapes. This study aims to combine freely distributed remote sensing data for the evaluation of gullies located in a tropical watershed with a history of cattle production. Eighty-four vectorized gullies were defined in the Pirizal River basin, part of the highly eroded Upper Taquari (Brazil). We examined 56 variables from Sentinel-1/2 and ALOSPALSAR-1 datasets, including SAR products and optical products like textures, water, vegetation, and terrain indices. Following a correlation analysis, 19 variables were selected for mapping in a Random Forest classifier by considering samples of active (soil) and stabilized (vegetation) pixels. The method reached an overall accuracy of 89%, in which soil abundance was responsible for 44% of the overall importance in the classification. Optical indices and texture products outperformed SAR products, whose importance represented only 14%. In the studied river basin, about 63% of the gullies were found stabilized, 30% in the process of stabilization, and only 7% active. The method proved effective, low cost, and promptly replicable to general river basins with gullies, mainly those in the tropics where vegetation has a significant role in soil loss control.

TI  - The management of the control against forest pests in protected areas: Kackar Mountains National Park
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TROPICAL INSECT SCIENCE
AB  - Pests are among the most important dangers threatening the existence and continuity of forests. Harmful insects cause great destruction in forests. The forestry organization performs chemical, mechanical, biotechnical, and biological control activities against pests and diseases in forests. Harmful insects are not as prominent and even ignored as forest fires in public sphere because their activities and damages do not appear suddenly, but the destruction caused by pests is understood after it becomes an epidemic. For this reason, it is vital to be informed about threats such as fires, insect epidemics, etc. that occur in forest areas as soon as possible and to fight with the support of the public. Kackar National Park is one of the areas with the richest ecotourism potential in Turkey. Forest pests are spread around the national park, causing serious damage to the forest and areas of cultural importance. Detection of forest pests that threaten the national park forests, which are the national treasure, is of critical importance for the sustainability of the area. There is a need to increase the knowledge and awareness levels of all segments of society in this respect. It was determined that only half of people who live in rural areas of Kackar Mountain National Park, which is located in the Eastern Black Sea Region, where intense insect damage was experienced for more than 60 years, have knowledge about forest pests. Also, 285.000 Rhizophagus grandis were reproduced and placed in forest trees in the scope of combating forest pests in the area, and 310 pheromone traps were placed in forest areas to determine the insect population and the management of the control. The 2.769.521 m3Picea orientalis that was damaged was removed from the area.

TI  - Outdoor malaria transmission in forested villages of Cambodia
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
AB  - Background: Despite progress in malaria control, malaria remains an important public health concern in Cambodia, mostly linked to forested areas. Large-scale vector control interventions in Cambodia are based on the free distribution of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs), targeting indoor- and late-biting malaria vectors only. The present study evaluated the vector density, early biting activity and malaria transmission of outdoor-biting malaria vectors in two forested regions in Cambodia.
   Methods: In 2005 two entomological surveys were conducted in 12 villages and their related forest plots in the east and west of Cambodia. Mosquitoes were collected outdoors by human landing collections and subjected to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect Plasmodium sporozoites after morphological identification. Blood samples were collected in the same villages for serological analyses. Collected data were analysed by the classification and regression tree (CART) method and linear regression analysis.
   Results: A total of 11,826 anophelines were recorded landing in 787 man-night collections. The majority (82.9%) were the known primary and secondary vectors. Most of the variability in vector densities and early biting rates was explained by geographical factors, mainly at village level. Vector densities were similar between forest and village sites. Based on ELISA results, 29% out of 17 Plasmodium-positive bites occurred before sleeping time, and 65% in the forest plots. The entomological inoculation rates of survey 1 were important predictors of the respective seroconversion rates in survey 2, whereas the mosquito densities were not.
   Discussion: In Cambodia, outdoor malaria transmission in villages and forest plots is important. In this context, deforestation might result in lower densities of the primary vectors, but also in higher densities of secondary vectors invading deforested areas. Moreover, higher accessibility of the forest could result in a higher man-vector contact. Therefore, additional vector control measures should be developed to target outdoor- and early-biting vectors.

TI  - Endozoochory and Fire as Germination Triggers in Neotropical Dry Forests: an Experimental Test
T2  - BIOTROPICA
AB  - Endozoochory and fire are crucial ecological factors determining germination success and recruitment in many plant species. Fire is a well-known germination trigger while endozoochory may allow seed dispersal along with an increase in germination. Their interaction has rarely been addressed, however, even though both factors are pervasive in human-transformed ecosystems like most Neotropical Dry Forests (NDF). For three common Mesoamerican tree species (Acacia pennatula, Enterolobium cyclocarpum, and Guazuma ulmifolia), we used feeding trials to assess the preference of cattle, which are their main seed dispersal agent. We also experimentally tested the interaction between gut passage and fire as triggers of germination. The fruits of the three species were eaten by cattle, but the small seeds of G. ulmifolia were ingested 10-fold more than those of the other species. While gut passage did not have any effect on germination, heat-shocks above 90 degrees C increased the number of germinating seeds by 15 percent. These results suggest that cattle may be a key dispersal vector in NDF, but that fire may be an important germination trigger. Physical dormancy in these species may have been selected for by extinct megaherbivores because it was a key trait ensuring seed survival after gut passage. However, in light of the recent expansion of cattle-ranching and fire occurrence in NDF, it has become a useful exaptation facilitating the colonization of disturbed areas.

TI  - 'None of my ancestors ever discussed this disease before!' How disease information shapes adaptive capacity of marginalised rural populations in India
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Smallholder farmer and tribal communities are often characterised as marginalised and highly vulnerable to emerging zoonotic diseases due to their relatively poor access to healthcare, worse-off health outcomes, proximity to sources of disease risks, and their social and livelihood organisation. Yet, access to relevant and timely disease information that could strengthen their adaptive capacity remain challenging and poorly characterised in the empirical literature. This paper addresses this gap by exploring the role of disease information in shaping the adaptive capacity of smallholder farmer and tribal groups to Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD), a tick-borne viral haemorrhagic fever. We carried out household surveys (n = 229) and in-depth interviews (n = 25) in two affected districts-Shimoga and Wayanad-in the Western Ghats region.
   Our findings suggest that, despite the generally limited awareness about KFD, access to disease information improved households' propensity to implement adaptation strategies relative to households that had no access to it. Of the variety of adaptation strategies implemented, vaccination, avoiding forest visits, wearing of protective clothing and footwear, application of dimethyl phthalate (DMP) oil and income diversification were identified by respondents as important adaptive measures during the outbreak seasons. Even so, we identified significant differences between individuals in exposure to disease information and its contribution to substantive adaptive action. Households reported several barriers to implement adaptation strategies including, lack of disease information, low efficacy of existing vaccine, distrust, religio-cultural sentiments, and livelihood concerns. We also found that informal information sharing presented a promising avenue from a health extension perspective albeit with trade-offs with potential distortion of the messages through misinformation and/or reporting bias. Altogether, our findings stress the importance of contextualising disease information and implementing interventions in a participatory way that sufficiently addresses the social determinants of health in order to bolster households' adaptive capacity to KFD and other neglected endemic zoonoses.
   Author summary
   There is widespread consensus that smallholder farmer and tribal communities are highly vulnerable to zoonotic diseases (illness passed between animals and people). This is largely due to their relatively poor access to healthcare and closeness to sources of disease risks. Although access to relevant and timely disease information could enhance their adaptive capacity, remain difficult and poorly understood. Drawing on survey data (n = 229) and in-depth interviews (n = 25) in two affected districts (Shimoga and Wayanad); we explored the role of disease information in shaping adaptation to Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD), a tick-borne viral haemorrhagic fever. We found that despite the limited awareness about KFD, access to disease information improved households' likelihood to implement adaptation strategies as compared to households that had no access to it. Households identified several barriers to implementation of adaptation strategies including, lack of disease information, low efficacy of existing vaccine, distrust, religio-cultural sentiments, and livelihood concerns. Our findings highlight the relevance of contextualising disease information and implementing interventions in a participatory manner in order to strengthen households' adaptive capacity to KFD and other neglected endemic zoonoses.

TI  - IgM antibody responses against <i>Plasmodium</i> antigens in neotropical primates in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest
T2  - FRONTIERS IN CELLULAR AND INFECTION MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Introduction: Zoonotic transmission is a challenge for the control and elimination of malaria. It has been recorded in the Atlantic Forest, outside the Amazon which is the endemic region in Brazil. However, only very few studies have assessed the antibody response, especially of IgM antibodies, in Neotropical primates (NP). Therefore, in order to contribute to a better understanding of the immune response in different hosts and facilitate the identification of potential reservoirs, in this study, naturally acquired IgM antibody responses against Plasmodium antigens were evaluated, for the first time, in NP from the Atlantic Forest.Methods: The study was carried out using 154 NP samples from three different areas of the Atlantic Forest. IgM antibodies against peptides of the circumsporozoite protein (CSP) from different Plasmodium species and different erythrocytic stage antigens were detected by ELISA.Results: Fifty-nine percent of NP had IgM antibodies against at least one CSP peptide and 87% against at least one Plasmodium vivax erythrocytic stage antigen. Levels of antibodies against PvAMA-1 were the highest compared to the other antigens. All families of NP showed IgM antibodies against CSP peptides, and, most strikingly, against erythrocytic stage antigens. Generalized linear models demonstrated that IgM positivity against PvCSP and PvAMA-1 was associated with PCR-detectable blood-stage malaria infection and the host being free-living. Interestingly, animals with IgM against both PvCSP and PvAMA-1 were 4.7 times more likely to be PCR positive than animals that did not have IgM for these two antigens simultaneously.Discussion: IgM antibodies against different Plasmodium spp. antigens are present in NP from the Atlantic Forest. High seroprevalence and antibody levels against blood-stage antigens were observed, which had a significant association with molecular evidence of infection. IgM antibodies against CSP and AMA-1 may be used as a potential marker for the identification of NP infected with Plasmodium, which are reservoirs of malaria in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest.

TI  - Mapping the risk of Nipah virus spillover into human populations in South and Southeast Asia
T2  - TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Background: Nipah virus (NiV) is a significant emerging zoonotic pathogen given its wide geographic distribution, and the severe morbidity and high mortality that accompanies infection. Moreover, the layered landscape epidemiology surrounding spillover from reservoir host species to humans is ill-defined. Identifying landscape features that contribute to NiV spillover would likely prove helpful in preventing emergence in human populations.
   Methods: Using an inhomogeneous Poisson model, this study investigated the role of vegetation cover, the human footprint (HFP) and reservoir Pteropus bat distribution to identify the spatial dependence of spillover and map risk across South and Southeast Asia.
   Results: The spatial model identified HFP (RR=1.08; 95% CI 1.05-1.11) and bat distribution (RR=19.44; 95% CI 1.92-196.7) as significant predictors of NiV risk, while vegetation cover was not significant after accounting for HFP and the presence of Pteropus bats.
   Conclusions: These findings further inform the landscape epidemiology of NiV and suggest specific conduits for spillover in the landscape. However, more detailed field studies will be required to validate these results.

TI  - Amphibian chytrid infections along the highest elevational gradient of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest
T2  - DISEASES OF AQUATIC ORGANISMS
AB  - Environmental variation along elevational gradients shapes conditions for pathogen development, which influences disease outcomes. Chytridiomycosis is a non-vectored disease caused by the aquatic fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) and is responsible for massive declines of amphibian populations all over the world. Several biotic and abiotic factors are known to influence Bd infection dynamics in amphibians, including temperature and host species richness. Here, we quantified Bd prevalence and load along an elevational gradient in the Caparao National Park (CNP), Brazil, and tested for associations of Bd infections with elevation, temperature, and species richness. We hypothesized that Bd infections would increase as local species richness decreased with elevation. We detected Bd along the entire elevational gradient and found a negative association between infection load and elevation. We did not detect significant associations between infection prevalence and elevation. Our findings are consistent with other wide elevational gradient studies, but are contrary to 2 other studies performed in the Atlantic Forest. We did not find the minimum elevational range that should be sampled to detect the influence of elevation on Bd variation. Our study represents the widest elevational gradient that has been sampled in Brazil and contributes to a better understanding of Bd distribution and dynamics in natural systems.

TI  - Soil microbial carbon and nutrient constraints are driven more by climate and soil physicochemical properties than by nutrient addition in forest ecosystems
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Soil enzymes produced by microorganisms transform substrates in the soil carbon (C) and nutrient cycles. Limitations in C and other nutrients could affect microbial biosynthesis processes, so we expect that soil enzyme activity will reflect microbial deficiencies in C, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) at a large spatial scale. We collected soil from nutrient addition trials in eight forest ecosystems, ranging from temperate forests to tropical forests in eastern China, and conducted vector analysis of the soil enzymatic stoichiometry to examine the spatial extent of soil microbial C and nutrient limitations. We also determined whether nutrient addition could alleviate nutrient limitation or otherwise impact soil microbial resource use. Soil microbial C vs. nutrient limitation (thereafter C limitation) was greater in the temperate forests than in the tropical forests, but did not vary with soil depth. Soil microbial P vs. N limitation (thereafter nutrient limitation) decreased with latitude, and increased with soil depth. We found a negative relationship between soil microbial C limitation and nutrient limitation, which was more pronounced in the topsoil than in deeper soil depths. Furthermore, we found that climate (mean annual precipitation and temperature), soil pH and soil nutrients were significantly correlated with soil microbial C (explaining about 23% of the variation) and nutrient limitation (responsible for about 87% of the variation). Nutrient addition represented similar to 1% of the variation in soil microbial C and nutrient limitations and thus did not alleviate nutrient deficiencies. We conclude that soil microbial C and nutrient limitations are more likely driven by climate and soil physicochemical properties than by nutrient addition in eight forest ecosystems. Since soil microbial C and nutrient limitations result from long-term adaptation of soil microbial communities to site-specific soil and environmental conditions, the soil enzyme activity is not modified by short-term changes in nutrient availability resulting from fertilizer application.

TI  - Host species, and not environment, predicts variation in blood parasite prevalence, distribution, and diversity along a humidity gradient in northern South America
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB  - Environmental factors strongly influence the ecology and evolution of vector-borne infectious diseases. However, our understanding of the influence of climatic variation on host-parasite interactions in tropical systems is rudimentary. We studied five species of birds and their haemosporidian parasites (Plasmodium and Haemoproteus) at 16 sampling sites to understand how environmental heterogeneity influences patterns of parasite prevalence, distribution, and diversity across a marked gradient in water availability in northern South America. We used molecular methods to screen for parasite infections and to identify parasite lineages. To characterize spatial heterogeneity in water availability, we used weather-station and remotely sensed climate data. We estimated parasite prevalence while accounting for spatial autocorrelation, and used a model selection approach to determine the effect of variables related to water availability and host species on prevalence. The prevalence, distribution, and lineage diversity of haemosporidian parasites varied among localities and host species, but we found no support for the hypothesis that the prevalence and diversity of parasites increase with increasing water availability. Host species and hostxclimate interactions had stronger effects on infection prevalence, and parasite lineages were strongly associated with particular host species. Because climatic variables had little effect on the overall prevalence and lineage diversity of haemosporidian parasites across study sites, our results suggest that independent host-parasite dynamics may influence patterns in parasitism in environmentally heterogeneous landscapes.

TI  - Mosquito (Diptera: Culicidae) Species Composition in Ovitraps From a Mesoamerican Tropical Montane Cloud Forest
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - Knowledge about mosquito species diversity at tropical montane cloud forests (TMCFs) in Mesoamerica is scarce. Here, we present data on mosquito species richness from samples biweekly collected, from January to December 2017, in ovitraps installed in a TMCF patch at Vazquez de Coronado County, Costa Rica. Ovitraps were placed at 2.25, 1.50 and 0.75 m at 16 sampling points. During the study period we measured relative humidity and air temperature at each sampling point, and water temperature, volume and pH in each ovitrap. We collected a total of 431 mosquito larvae belonging to five taxonomic units, one identified to the genus level and four to the species level. The most common mosquito species was Culex bihaicolus Dyar & Nunez Tovar (Diptera: Culicidae), which accounted for nearly 80% (n = 344) of the collected mosquitoes. Culex nigripalpus Theobald (Diptera: Culicidae) was the only medically important species we found and it was collected both in the dry (January to March) and rainy season (April to December). Over 95% (n = 411) of the mosquitoes were collected during the rainy season and 60% (n = 257) at 0.75 m. Among the environmental variables that we measured, only water volume and pH were significantly (P < 0.05) different between the dry and rainy season, the former increasing and the later decreasing during the rainy season. These results suggest that rainfall plays a major role regulating the phenology of the sampled mosquito species and highlight the need to screen for pathogens in Cx. nigripalpus at the study area.

TI  - Yellow fever: A brief history of a tropical Virosis
T2  - PRESSE MEDICALE
AB  - Yellow fever is a zoonotic arbovirosis, the agent of which is transmitted by mosquitoes. In humans, this virus can cause hemorrhagic hepato-nephritis, while mild or inapparent infections are common. The catastrophic epidemics that occurred, mainly in the 18th and the 19th centuries, in Latin America and the United States as well as in the port cities of West Africa and Europe, had considerable demographic, socio-economic and political repercussions. The viral nature of the infectious agent and its transmission by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, previously sus-pected by Beauperthuy, were demonstrated by Carlos Finlay in 1881 and confirmed by the American Com-mission led by Walter Reed in Havana in 1900 and by the French Commission led by Emile Marchoux in Rio de Janeiro in 1901-1905. The control of Ae. aegypti could then be implemented effectively. It was only in 1927 that the yellow fever virus was isolated in Africa, its continent of origin, by French researchers from the Pasteur Institute in Dakar and by the American and English teams of the Rockefeller Foundation. Soon after, epidemiologists realized that there were forest cycles of the virus, involving monkeys and vectors other than Ae. aegypti, and consequently recognized the existence of a wild reservoir of the virus. Once the virus was isolated, work on vaccine development could begin. This research was carried out by the Institut Pasteur in Dakar and by the Rockefeller Foundation. The two teams succeeded in obtaining two live vaccines conferring excellent and long-lasting protection: the neurotropic "Dakar " vaccine (1934) and the "Rockefeller " 17D vaccine (1937), which was better tolerated. From then on, the fight against of yellow fever involved entomological control and vaccine protection, and it was a huge success until the 1960s. Unfortunately, the control programs were gradually reduced, and in some countries terminated. This resulted in the return of Ae. aegypti in urban areas and in insufficient vaccination coverage. Risks of epidemics reappeared, in Latin America as well as Africa. In the early 21st century, epidemiologists are worried about these resurgences, especially since we still have no indisputable explanation for the absence of the disease on the Asian continent. Obviously, yellow fever is not a disease of the past. (C) 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

TI  - Mapping the dengue scientific landscape worldwide: a bibliometric and network analysis
T2  - MEMORIAS DO INSTITUTO OSWALDO CRUZ
AB  - BACKGROUND Despite the current global trend of reduction in the morbidity and mortality of neglected diseases, dengue's incidence has increased and occurrence areas have expanded. Dengue also persists as a scientific and technological challenge since there is no effective treatment, vaccine, vector control or public health intervention. Combining bibliometrics and social network analysis methods can support the mapping of dengue research and development (R&D) activities worldwide.
   OBJECTIVES The aim of this paper is to map the scientific scenario related to dengue research worldwide.
   METHODS We use scientific publication data from Web of Science Core Collection - articles indexed in Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED) - and combine bibliometrics and social network analysis techniques to identify the most relevant journals, scientific references, research areas, countries and research organisations in the dengue scientific landscape.
   FINDINGS Our results show a significant increase of dengue publications over time; tropical medicine and virology as the most frequent research areas and biochemistry and molecular biology as the most central area in the network; USA and Brazil as the most productive countries; and Mahidol University and Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz as the main research organisations and the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention as the most central organisation in the collaboration network.
   MAIN CONCLUSIONS Our findings can be used to strengthen a global knowledge platform guiding policy, planning and funding decisions as well as to providing directions to researchers and institutions. So that, by offering to the scientific community, policy makers and public health practitioners a mapping of the dengue scientific landscape, this paper has aimed to contribute to upcoming debates, decision-making and planning on dengue R& D and public health strategies worldwide.

TI  - Spatiotemporal prediction of infectious diseases using structured Gaussian processes with application to Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   Infectious diseases are one of the primary healthcare problems worldwide, leading to millions of deaths annually. To develop effective control and prevention strategies, we need reliable computational tools to understand disease dynamics and to predict future cases. These computational tools can be used by policy makers to make more informed decisions.
   Methodology/Principal findings
   In this study, we developed a computational framework based on Gaussian processes to perform spatiotemporal prediction of infectious diseases and exploited the special structure of similarity matrices in our formulation to obtain a very efficient implementation. We then tested our framework on the problem of modeling Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever cases between years 2004 and 2015 in Turkey.
   Conclusions/Significance
   We showed that our Gaussian process formulation obtained better results than two frequently used standard machine learning algorithms (i.e., random forests and boosted regression trees) under temporal, spatial, and spatiotemporal prediction scenarios. These results showed that our framework has the potential to make an important contribution to public health policy makers.

TI  - Exploring potential inhibitors against Kyasanur forest disease by utilizing molecular dynamics simulations and ensemble docking
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOMOLECULAR STRUCTURE & DYNAMICS
AB  - Kyasanur forest disease (KFD) is a tick-borne, neglected tropical disease, caused by KFD virus (KFDV) which belongs to Flavivirus (Flaviviridae family). This emerging viral disease is a major threat to humans. Currently, vaccination is the only controlling method against the KFDV, and its effectiveness is very low. An effective control strategy is required to combat this emerging tropical disease using the existing resources. In this regard, in silico drug repurposing method offers an effective strategy to find suitable antiviral drugs against KFDV proteins. Drug repurposing is an effective strategy to identify new use for approved or investigational drugs that are outside the scope of their initial usage and the repurposed drugs have lower risk and higher safety compared to de novo developed drugs, because their toxicity and safety issues are profoundly investigated during the preclinical trials in human/other models. In the present work, we evaluated the effectiveness of the FDA approved and natural compounds against KFDV proteins using in silico molecular docking and molecular simulations. At present, no experimentally solved 3D structures for the KFD viral proteins are available in Protein Data Bank and hence their homology model was developed and used for the analysis. The present analysis successfully developed the reliable homology model of NS3 of KFDV, in terms of geometry and energy contour. Further, in silico molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations successfully presented four FDA approved drugs and one natural compound against the NS3 homology model of KFDV.

TI  - Forest health assessment for geo-environmental planning and management in hilltop mining areas using Hyperion and Landsat data
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
AB  - This work focuses on assessing the health condition of the forest using Hyperspectral and Multispectral satellite imagery and validating it with field spectra data. The field-based spectroradiometer and PCE instrument were used for collection of forest health spectra and measurement of dust accumulation on leaves respectively. In the study area, mining activities have very high potential to induce forestry health and environmental problem which necessitated a proper forest health assessment and its monitoring. The result of the Discrimination analysis (21 spectral wavebands) were used for forest health classification. The result shows that healthy forest parts are found in the upper as well as the lower hilly side of Kiriburu and Meghahatuburu mines. Some healthy pixels are located within 1.5 km from mines because it was situated off the hillside. Furthermore, it also exhibits positive relation amongst different forest health class, distance from mines and foliar dust concentration. Hyperspectral (narrow-bands) Hyperion data used with Vegetation Indices (VIs) model shows better accuracy for forest health assessment (overall accuracy 81.52%, kappa statistic 0.79) than Spectral Angle Mapper (overall accuracy 79.99%, kappa statistic 0.75) as well as Support Vector Machine (overall accuracy 76.53%, kappa statistic 0.71). It was observed that the health assessment accuracy (using SVM algorithm) achieved with Hyperion bands was significantly higher than multispectral (broad-bands) Landsat-OLI data (overall accuracy 67.27%, kappa statistic 0.62). Finally, the forest health assessment results were validated by 60 field sampled spectra data obtained from spectroradiometer. The forest health map obtained provides a guideline for geo-environmental planning and management in mining proximity forest area.

TI  - Investigating the Contribution of Peridomestic Transmission to Risk of Zoonotic Malaria Infection in Humans
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   In recent years, the primate malaria Plasmodium knowlesi has emerged in human populations throughout South East Asia, with the largest hotspot being in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. Control efforts are hindered by limited knowledge of where and when people get exposed to mosquito vectors. It is assumed that exposure occurs primarily when people are working in forest areas, but the role of other potential exposure routes (including domestic or peri-domestic transmission) has not been thoroughly investigated.
   Methodology/Principal Findings
   We integrated entomological surveillance within a comprehensive case-control study occurring within a large hotspot of transmission in Sabah, Malaysia. Mosquitoes were collected at 28 pairs households composed of one where an occupant had a confirmed P. knowlesi infection within the preceding 3 weeks ("case") and an associated "control" where no infection was reported. Human landing catches were conducted to measure the number and diversity of mosquitoes host seeking inside houses and in the surrounding peri-domestic (outdoors but around the household) areas. The predominant malaria vector species was Anopheles balabacensis, most of which were caught outdoors in the early evening (6pm - 9pm). It was significantly more abundant in the peri-domestic area than inside houses (5.5-fold), and also higher at case than control households (0.28 +/- 0.194 vs 0.17 +/- 0.127, p<0.001). Ten out of 641 An. balabacensis tested were positive for simian malaria parasites, but none for P. knowlesi.
   Conclusions/Significance
   This study shows there is a possibility that humans can be exposed to P. knowlesi infection around their homes. The vector is highly exophagic and few were caught indoors indicating interventions using bednets inside households may have relatively little impact.

TI  - Application of deterministic and stochastic geo-statistical tools for analysing spatial patterns of fish density in a tropical monsoonal estuary
T2  - AQUATIC ECOLOGY
AB  - In this paper, we compared the efficiency of advanced deterministic and stochastic geo-statistical techniques to predict spatial patterns of fish density in the tropical monsoonal estuary, Zuari, using the following environmental descriptors: temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, transparency and geographic coordinates. The methods applied in this study were multiple linear regression, Cubist, support vector regression, random forest regression, universal kriging and regression kriging. Fish abundance and environmental data were collected from September, 2013 to August, 2016 in 48 sampling stations distributed along the estuarine gradient. Ranking procedure of various regression methods showed that the Cubist model was the best performing model based on prediction accuracy in thedevelopment phase and prediction consistency in the validation phase. Latitude, temperature, salinity and dissolved oxygen had positive influence on fish abundance, while longitude and transparency showed negative impacts. This study offers scope for refining the employed currently models to predict spatial densities of fish populations using a wide range of available biotic and abiotic variables, which will enable to develop an efficient management framework for tropical monsoonal estuaries.

TI  - Spatial and temporal patterns of exotic shrub invasion in an Australian tropical grassland
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
AB  - We used aerial photography from 1960, 1974 and 1994 to quantify meso-scale spatial and temporal invasion patterns of an exotic, leguminous shrub, Acacia nilotica, in a northern Australia grassland. The invasion was episodic, the population remained relatively stable from 1960 to 1974, then exhibited a large increase from 1974 to 1994. This episodic increase did not appear to be regulated by climate or changes in landscape attributes, but rather, paralleled a shift to cattle (a more effective dispersal vector) as the dominant domestic livestock species, implicating more effective dispersal as the proximate cause. We also measured much greater A. nilotica densities adjacent to water courses than in upland areas, suggesting either better quality habitat or greater numbers of seeds deposited there by cattle. We infer that habitat quality rather than seed availability regulates shrub density as density remained constant from 1974 to 1994 in areas that were occupied in the 1960 to 1974 period. There was a significant effect of landscape position on population dynamics of the invasion. A. nilotica increased in both extent and density in riparian areas but remained static in upland areas during 1960-1974. There were significant increases in extent and density in both riparian and upland areas in 1974-1994. Thus, it is likely that landscapes with fewer or smaller riparian areas would be less susceptable to the invasion of A. nilotica. However, the ability of domestic stock to transport seeds across distances that exceed the distance between riparian areas renders this argument less relevant.
   The transition from open grassland to shrubland may be irreversible in a practical sense, so control programs should emphasize containment of the invasion to existing levels as well as restoration of invaded areas. This will require strategies, tactics and operations to 1) control cattle movement, 2) exclude cattle from seed producing A. nilotica populations, 3) detect new populations early in the life cycle and implement broadscale, low-cost control techniques and 3) prioritize eradication efforts on populations that act as a seed source to uninfested areas.

TI  - ESTIMATION OF REGIONAL FOREST ABOVEGROUND BIOMASS COMBINING ICESAT-GLAS WAVEFORMS AND HJ-1A/HSI HYPERSPECTRAL IMAGERIES
T2  - XXIII ISPRS CONGRESS, COMMISSION VII
CP  - 23rd Congress of the International-Society-for-Photogrammetry-and-Remote-Sensing (ISPRS)
AB  - Estimation of forest aboveground biomass (AGB) is a critical challenge for understanding the global carbon cycle because it dominates the dynamics of the terrestrial carbon cycle. Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) system has a unique capability for estimating accurately forest canopy height, which has a direct relationship and can provide better understanding to the forest AGB. The Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) onboard the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) is the first polar orbiting LiDAR instrument for global observations of Earth, and it has been widely used for extracting forest AGB with footprints of nominally 70m in diameter on the earth's surface. However, the GLAS footprints are discrete geographically, and thus it has been restricted to produce the regional full coverage of forest AGB. To overcome the limit of discontinuity, the Hyper Spectral Imager (HSI) of HJ-1A with 115 bands was combined with GLAS waveforms to predict the regional forest AGB in the study. Corresponding with the field investigation in Wangqing of Changbai Mountain, China, the GLAS waveform metrics were derived and employed to establish the AGB model, which was used further for estimating the AGB within GLAS footprints. For HSI imagery, the Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF) method was used to decrease noise and reduce the dimensionality of spectral bands, and consequently the first three of MNF were able to offer almost 98% spectral information and qualified to regress with the GLAS estimated AGB. Afterwards, the support vector regression (SVR) method was employed in the study to establish the relationship between GLAS estimated AGB and three of HSI MNF (i.e. MNF1, MNF2 and MNF3), and accordingly the full covered regional forest AGB map was produced. The results showed that the adj.R-2 and RMSE of SVR-AGB models were 0.75 and 4.68 t.hm(-2) for broadleaf forests, 0.73 and 5.39 t.hm(-2) for coniferous forests and 0.71 and 6.15 t.hm(-2) for mixed forests respectively. The full covered regional forest AGB map of the study area had 0.62 of accuracy and 11.11 t.hm(-2) of RMSE. The study demonstrated that it holds great potential to achieve the full covered regional forest AGB distribution with higher accuracy by combing LiDAR data and hyperspectral imageries.

TI  - Host plant affiliations of aphid vector species found in a remote tropical environment
T2  - VIRUS RESEARCH
AB  - The Ord River Irrigation Area (ORIA) produces annual crops during the dry season (April to October), and perennial crops all-year-round, and is located in tropical northwestern Australia. Sandalwood plantations cover 50 % of the ORIA's cropping area. Aphids cause major crop losses through transmission of viruses causing debilitating diseases and direct feeding damage. During 2016-2017, in both dry and wet seasons a total of 3320 leaf samples were collected from diverse types of sites on cultivated and uncultivated land and 1248 (38 %) of them were from aphid-colonized plants. In addition, aphids were found at 236 of 355 sampling sites. The 62 plant species sampled came from 23 families 19 of which contained aphid-colonized species. Aphid hosts included introduced weeds, Australian native plants, and volunteer or planted crop plants. Six aphid species were identified by light microscopy and CO1 gene sequencing, but there was no within species nucleotide sequence diversity. Aphis nerii, Hysteroneura setariae, Rhopalosiphum maidis and Schoutedenia ralumensis each colonized 1-3 plant species from a single plant family. A. craccivora colonized 14 species in five plant families. A. gossypii was the most polyphagous species colonizing 19 species in 11 plant families. A. gossypii, A. craccivora, A. nerii and S. ralumensis were found in both wet and dry seasons. Because of A. craccivora's prevalence and high incidences on understory weeds and host trees, sandalwood plantations were important reservoirs for aphid spread to wild and crop plant hosts growing in cultivated and uncultivated land. Alternative hosts growing in rural bushland, irrigation channel banks, vacant or fallow land, and orchard plantation understories also constituted significant aphid reservoirs. This study provides new knowledge of the ecology of aphid vector species not only in the ORIA but also in tropical northern Australia generally. It represents one of relatively few investigations on aphid ecology in tropical environments worldwide.

TI  - A mechanistic model of snakebite as a zoonosis: Envenoming incidence is driven by snake ecology, socioeconomics and its impacts on snakes
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Snakebite is the only WHO-listed, not infectious neglected tropical disease (NTD), although its eco-epidemiology is similar to that of zoonotic infections: envenoming occurs after a vertebrate host contacts a human. Accordingly, snakebite risk represents the interaction between snake and human factors, but their quantification has been limited by data availability. Models of infectious disease transmission are instrumental for the mitigation of NTDs and zoonoses. Here, we represented snake-human interactions with disease transmission models to approximate geospatial estimates of snakebite incidence in Sri Lanka, a global hotspot. Snakebites and envenomings are described by the product of snake and human abundance, mirroring directly transmitted zoonoses. We found that human-snake contact rates vary according to land cover (surrogate of occupation and socioeconomic status), the impacts of humans and climate on snake abundance, and by snake species. Our findings show that modelling snakebite as zoonosis provides a mechanistic eco-epidemiological basis to understand snakebites, and the possible implications of global environmental and demographic change for the burden of snakebite.
   Author summary
   Snakebite envenoming occurs after contact between two vertebrates, which makes it similar to some transmissible diseases. Based on such similarity, we used estimates of snakebite incidence, snake abundance and biology, and surrogates of human occupational risks to derive a mathematical expression that represents snakebite envenoming as human-snake contacts. Our model explained risk variability very well. We found that snake and human abundance explain incidence estimates and that agriculture-linked occupations tend to have more frequent contacts with snakes; and that snake abundance decreases with increasing human population. Because snake abundance estimates and contact rates are based on climate or land cover, we identify a pathway for land use change, global warming and population growth to affect the epidemiology of snakebites.

TI  - Landscape, Environmental and Social Predictors of Hantavirus Risk in Sao Paulo, Brazil
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS) is a disease caused by Hantavirus, which are negative-sense RNA viruses in the family Bunyaviridae that are highly virulent to humans. Numerous factors modify risk of Hantavirus transmission and consequent HPS risk. Human-driven landscape change can foster transmission risk by increasing numbers of habitat generalist rodent species that serve as the principal reservoir host. Climate can also affect rodent population dynamics and Hantavirus survival, and a number of social factors can influence probability of HPS transmission to humans. Evaluating contributions of these factors to HPS risk may enable predictions of future outbreaks, and is critical to development of effective public health strategies. Here we rely on a Bayesian model to quantify associations between annual HPS incidence across the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil (1993-2012) and climate variables (annual precipitation, annual mean temperature), landscape structure metrics (proportion of native habitat cover, number of forest fragments, proportion of area planted with sugarcane), and social factors (number of men older than 14 years and Human Development Index). We built separate models for the main two biomes of the state (cerrado and Atlantic forest). In both biomes Hantavirus risk increased with proportion of land cultivated for sugarcane and HDI, but proportion of forest cover, annual mean temperature, and population at risk also showed positive relationships in the Atlantic forest. Our analysis provides the first evidence that social, landscape, and climate factors are associated with HPS incidence in the Neotropics. Our risk map can be used to support the adoption of preventive measures and optimize the allocation of resources to avoid disease propagation, especially in municipalities that show medium to high HPS risk (> 5% of risk), and aimed at sugarcane workers, minimizing the risk of future HPS outbreaks.

TI  - Mosquito Vector Diversity across Habitats in Central Thailand Endemic for Dengue and Other Arthropod-Borne Diseases
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Recent years have seen the greatest ecological disturbances of our times, with global human expansion, species and habitat loss, climate change, and the emergence of new and previously-known infectious diseases. Biodiversity loss affects infectious disease risk by disrupting normal relationships between hosts and pathogens. Mosquito-borne pathogens respond to changing dynamics on multiple transmission levels and appear to increase in disturbed systems, yet current knowledge of mosquito diversity and the relative abundance of vectors as a function of habitat change is limited. We characterize mosquito communities across habitats with differing levels of anthropogenic ecological disturbance in central Thailand. During the 2008 rainy season, adult mosquito collections from 24 sites, representing 6 habitat types ranging from forest to urban, yielded 62,126 intact female mosquitoes (83,325 total mosquitoes) that were assigned to 109 taxa. Female mosquito abundance was highest in rice fields and lowest in forests. Diversity indices and rarefied species richness estimates indicate the mosquito fauna was more diverse in rural and less diverse in rice field habitats, while extrapolated estimates of true richness (Chao1 and ACE) indicated higher diversity in the forest and fragmented forest habitats and lower diversity in the urban. Culex sp. (Vishnui subgroup) was the most common taxon found overall and the most frequent in fragmented forest, rice field, rural, and suburban habitats. The distributions of species of medical importance differed significantly across habitat types and were always lowest in the intact, forest habitat. The relative abundance of key vector species, Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus, was negatively correlated with diversity, suggesting that direct species interactions and/or habitat-mediated factors differentially affecting invasive disease vectors may be important mechanisms linking biodiversity loss to human health. Our results are an important first step for understanding the dynamics of mosquito vector distributions under changing environmental features across landscapes of Thailand.

TI  - Spatial Forecasting of the Landscape in Rapidly Urbanizing Hill Stations of South Asia: A Case Study of Nuwara Eliya, Sri Lanka (1996-2037)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Forecasting landscape changes is vital for developing and implementing sustainable urban planning. Presently, apart from lowland coastal cities, mountain cities (i.e., hill stations) are also facing the negative impacts of rapid urbanization due to their economic and social importance. However, few studies are addressing urban landscape changes in hill stations in Asia. This study aims to examine and forecast landscape changes in the rapidly urbanizing hill station of Nuwara Eliya, Sri Lanka. Landsat data and geospatial techniques including support vector machines, urban-rural gradient, and statistical analysis were used to map and examine the land use/land cover (LULC) change in Nuwara Eliya during the 1996-2006 and 2006-2017 periods. The multilayer perceptron neural network-Markov model was applied to simulate future LULC changes for 2027 and 2037. The results show that Nuwara Eliya has been directly affected by rapid urban development. During the past 21 years (1996-2017), built-up areas increased by 1791 ha while agricultural land declined by 1919 ha due to augmented urban development pressure. The pressure of urban development on forest land has been relatively low, mainly due to strict conservation government policies. The results further show that the observed landscape changes will continue in a similar pattern in the future, confirming a significant increase and decrease of built-up and agricultural land, respectively, from 2017 to 2037. The changes in agricultural land exhibit a strong negative relationship with the changes in built-up land along the urban-rural gradient (R-2 were 0.86 in 1996-2006, and 0.93 in 2006-2017, respectively). The observed LULC changes could negatively affect the production of unique upcountry agricultural products such as exotic vegetables, fruits, cut flowers, and world-famous Ceylon tea. Further, unplanned development could cause several environmental issues. The study is important for understanding future LULC changes and suggesting necessary remedial measures to minimize possible undesirable environmental and socioeconomic impacts.

TI  - Tolerance of soil pathogens co-varies with shade tolerance across species of tropical tree seedlings
T2  - ECOLOGY
AB  - A negative feedback between local abundance and natural enemies could contribute to maintaining tree species diversity by constraining population growth of common species. Soil pathogens could be an important mechanism of such noncompetitive distance and density-dependent (NCDD) mortality, but susceptibility to local pathogens may be ameliorated by a life history strategy that favors survivorship. In a shade-house experiment (1% full sun), we tested seedling life span, growth, and mass allocation responses to microbial extract filtered from conspecific-cultured soil in 21 tree species that varied in abundance and shade tolerance in a wet tropical forest (La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica). Forty-three percent of the species had significant reductions, and 10% of the species had significant increases in life span, growth, root length, or root surface area when inoculated with microbial extract; 10% of the species experienced opposing reductions and increases in these characteristics. Contrary to expectation, species' local abundance was not related to species-specific responses to microbial extracts from cultured soils. Across species, seedling shade tolerance (survival at 1% full sun) was negatively correlated with susceptibility to the microbial treatment for both survival and total mass accumulation, thereby exaggerating shade tolerance differences among species. Thus, soil pathogens may contribute to species coexistence through heightening niche differentiation rather than through negative density dependence in common species.

TI  - High prevalence and diversity of Bartonella in small mammals from the biodiverse Western Ghats
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Author summary
   Zoonotic bacterial infections cause both economic and health burdens to humans, especially in developing countries. Bartonella is a diverse group with several species that are infectious to humans. There is limited knowledge of Bartonella diversity and subsequent risk for spillover in several tropical countries, including India. This study, set in a biodiversity hotspot with high human density, reveals a high prevalence and diversity of Bartonella in the most common, and synanthropic small mammals. Several lineages identified are phylogenetically related to zoonotic species known to cause infections in humans. We suggest that there is unexplored diversity of Bartonella in small mammals that reside in human-modified landscapes in India, demonstrating an urgent need for further investigation. By identifying the natural reservoirs of pathogens, their ecology, and their relationship and proximity to humans, we will be able to proactively survey for these under-detected bacterial infections and minimize the burden.
   Bartonella species are recognized globally as emerging zoonotic pathogens. Small mammals such as rodents and shrews are implicated as major natural reservoirs for these microbial agents. Nevertheless, in several tropical countries, like India, the diversity of Bartonella in small mammals remain unexplored and limited information exists on the natural transmission cycles (reservoirs and vectors) of these bacteria. Using a multi-locus sequencing approach, we investigated the prevalence, haplotype diversity, and phylogenetic affinities of Bartonella in small mammals and their associated mites in a mixed-use landscape in the biodiverse Western Ghats in southern India. We sampled 141 individual small mammals belonging to eight species. Bartonella was detected in five of the eight species, including three previously unknown hosts. We observed high interspecies variability of Bartonella prevalence in the host community. However, the overall prevalence (52.5%) and haplotype diversity (0.9) was high for the individuals tested. Of the seven lineages of Bartonella identified in our samples, five lineages were phylogenetically related to putative zoonotic species-B. tribocorum, B. queenslandensis, and B. elizabethae. Haplotypes identified from mites were identical to those identified from their host species. This indicates that these Bartonella species may be zoonotic, but further work is necessary to confirm whether these are pathogenic and pose a threat to humans. Taken together, these results emphasize the presence of hitherto unexplored diversity of Bartonella in wild and synanthropic small mammals in mixed-use landscapes. The study also highlights the necessity to assess the risk of spillover to humans and other incidental hosts.

TI  - Machine learning: Modeling increment in diameter of individual trees on Atlantic Forest fragments
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
AB  - Growth models at individual levels allow a more detailed description of the forest dynamics. However, many fittings using statistical models have shown low performance in native forests due to variation between the increments of different trees or species and even within the same species. In this study, we evaluated the ac-curacy of predictions of annual periodic increment in diameter (API(dbh); cm yr(-1)) of individual trees in the Atlantic Forest using three machine learning techniques: artificial neural network (ANN); support vector re-gression (SVR); and random forest (RF). The study was carried out in three fragments of Atlantic Forest: Ipaba (IP), SAo Jose (SJ), and Cachoeira das Pombas (CP) located respectively in the municipalities of Caratinga, Coronel Fabriciano, and GuanhAes, Minas Gerais State, Brazil. In IP, SJ and CP were allocated 22, 12 and, 20 plots, respectively, with 0.05 ha each. The data: circumference at 1.30 m (cbh; cm), total height (H; m), and scientific names of trees with cbh 15 cm were collected in the years 2002, 2007, 2012, and 2017 in the all fragments. Three semi-independent competition indexes were calculated: Glover and Hool (1979), Stage (1973), and adapted from Glover and Hool (1979). In each fragment, the species were grouped into five APIdbh groups through cluster analysis. Seventy percent of the observations of each species, in each period, were set for training and 30% for validation through balanced partitioning. The selection of the best configuration of each technique was through the statistics of correlation between the observed and predicted increments (r(yy)), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), weighted value (WV), observed and predicted API(dbh) scatter plots and scatter plots of the standardized residuals as a function of diameter at the height of 1.30 m (dbh). After selecting the best configuration of each technique in each fragment, cross-validation was applied with 10 partitions and 50 repetitions. The RMSE means were calculated for each of the 50 cross-validation repetitions. Friedman and Nemenyi nonparametric tests were applied to evaluate the best technique for each fragment, based on RMSE means in cross-validation. The ANN presented the lowest RMSE mean (0.1382-0.4155) and the SVR the highest (0.1662-0.4453) in cross-validation for all fragments. In the Nemenyi test, the distance from ANN to RF and SVR on all fragments was higher than the critical distance of 0.47. Therefore, ANN was the technique that presented the highest efficiency to predict the diameter increment of trees in fragments of Atlantic Forest.

AB  - Surveys of disease of four species of tropical acacias important for industrial plantations are summarised, recording occurrence and impact of the most significant diseases. The surveys, carried out in northern Australia, India, Peninsular Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia, indicate that canker diseases (including pink disease), phyllode rust, root-rot fungi and heart-rot have the potential to reduce the productivity of acacia plantations in the tropics.

TI  - Lassa Fever in Guinea: I. Epidemiology of Human Disease and Clinical Observations
T2  - VECTOR-BORNE AND ZOONOTIC DISEASES
AB  - The arenavirus Lassa is found in West Africa, where it sometimes causes a severe illness called Lassa fever. Lassa fever has been seldom investigated outside of a few hyperendemic regions, where the described epidemiology may differ from that in areas of low or moderate incidence of disease. Through a prospective cohort study, we investigated the epidemiology and clinical presentation of Lassa fever in Guinea, where the disease has been infrequently recognized. A surveillance system was established, and suspected cases were enrolled at five Guinean hospitals. Clinical observations were made, and blood was taken for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay testing and isolation of Lassa virus. Lassa fever was confirmed in 22 (7%) of 311 suspected cases. Another 43 (14%) had Lassa IgG antibodies, indicating past exposure. Both sexes and a wide variety of age and ethnic groups were affected. The disease was more frequently found, and the IgG seroprevalence generally higher, in the southeastern forest region. In some areas, there were significant discrepancies between the incidence of Lassa fever and the prevalence of antibody. Clinical presentations between those with Lassa fever and other febrile illnesses were essentially indistinguishable. Clinical predictors of a poor outcome were noted, but again were not specific for Lassa fever. Case-fatality rates for those with Lassa fever and non-Lassa febrile illnesses were 18% and 15%, respectively. Seasonal fluctuation in the incidence of Lassa fever was noted, but occurred similarly with non-Lassa febrile illnesses. Our results, perhaps typical of the scenario throughout much of West Africa, indicate Lassa virus infection to be widespread in certain areas of Guinea, but difficult to distinguish clinically.

TI  - To prune or not to prune; pruning induced decay in tropical sandalwood
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Heartwood rot (a fungal disease) has the potential to significantly reduce the sandalwood oil production of Santalum album. With new plantations being established with sandalwood oil as the major product, it is imperative to know the consequences of routine form-pruning in tropical areas. Examining pruning wound responses in 1 and 5-year-old trees at the end of the dry and wet seasons, it was possible to ascertain the best pruning age and season in relation to occlusion. Pathogenic wood fungi were isolated from wounds and fungal spore monitoring was undertaken at the two trial sites at time of pruning. Younger trees had smaller wounds which were quicker to occlude and produced a lower decay rating which decreased over time. Wood inhabiting fungi were isolated from all pruning wounds and identified using the ITS gene region. There was a total of 531 fungal isolates, identified in 75 fungal taxa. Older trees had significantly more fungal species compared to younger trees. Pruning season did not significantly affect occlusion, the amount of resultant decay, nor the total number of fungal species isolated. Endophytes were isolated from every tree, comprising 52% of isolations. Younger trees had more endophytes, but less rot fungi than older trees. Canker fungi were isolated from almost all the older trees. In the older trees, rot fungi were predominant in trees pruned at end of the dry season. Metabarcoding of spores collected in spore traps resulted in 565 operational taxonomic units (OTU's) which were placed in 211 genera and 114 families, with about 55% classified as unknown fungi. About 23% of all reads corresponded to potential pathogens, however, the proportion of spore groups present at time of pruning at each plantation was not indicative of the fungal niches isolated from wounds. This study has shown that it is better to prune S. album when they are young to decrease the amount of potential decay. To reduce the risk of heartwood rot fungal diseases entering via the pruning wound, it would be preferable to prune at the beginning of the dry season. This will be applicable to other tropical tree species.

TI  - Public health capacity building at the andes-amazon region, in the context of changes in land use/cover and climate, migration, roads and dams building and (re)emerging neglected tropical diseases
T2  - ARTICLES FROM THE 13TH WORLD CONGRESS ON PUBLIC HEALTH
CP  - 13th World Congress on Public Health
AB  - In Amazonia, forest burning is used to convert forested areas into pastures or plantations. Climate projections point to a decrease in humidity and increase in temperature - climatic conditions that foster forest fires, closing the circle. Unprecedented regional changes due to hydroelectric dams, hydro-ways and paved roads will impact on the epidemiology of human diseases, over the next years. Land use/cover change (LUCC) and the associated biodiversity-loss favour the disruption of natural cycles that impinge on vectors' abundance. Increased migration and urbanisation will affect the spread of transmission of vector-borne diseases, by increasing the density of both people and vectors and the transit of people. The most striking changes already observed are American Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (ACL) and Bartonellosis. 90% of ACL occur in 7 countries (among them Brazil and Peru), where new settlements, intrusion into primary forest, deforestation, human migration, agricultural development, and dams building increase the exposure to vectors and are leading to an increase in cases. The municipality of Assis Brasil, on the tri-national borders, present an average of 1,336 cases per 100,000 inhabitants (2001-2010): 20-fold the level of 71 cases considered of high transmission by the Brazilian Ministry of Health. The forthcoming part of this on-going project aims at developing workshops for health-service managers and policy-makers, and short courses for undergraduate, masters and doctoral students. A better understanding of the role played by unsound regional development policies in perpetuating the above-depicted perverse circle will represent a timing response to the urgent need to advance scientifically informed decision-making.

TI  - Species-specific water use by forest tree species: From the tree to the stand
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
AB  - Forests play a critical role in the hydrological cycle making the study of water use by trees and forest stands of prime importance in the global change context Very negative effects of increasing and more intense droughts on forest vegetation have been described over the last decades. Symptoms of disease and decline have been associated with changed precipitation patterns in many forests particularly in European temperate and Mediterranean regions. Intra- and inter-specific differences in both physiology and morphology exert a large but not well understood influence on the water balance of forest ecosystems, further affecting their vulnerability to drought. Stand structure and composition influences rainfall interception, runoff and water fluxes of the whole ecosystem. Both expanding plantations of renovated interest for biofuel industry and natural and semi-natural forests must be managed in a sustainable way on the basis of their water consumption. We review the role of key drivers on forest water use such as species composition, tree canopy status of each of them and species specific sensitivity to soil water scarcity. Specifically we discuss the role of these factors for natural forest, but with references also to forest plantations. Water scarcity is expected to be one of the largest societal problems worldwide in the near future, so water use by natural and planted forest ecosystems has become a central subject in current research agendas.

TI  - Evolutionary Challenges to Humanity Caused by Uncontrolled Carbon Emissions: The Stockholm Paradigm
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - This review paper discusses the Stockholm Paradigm (SP) as a theoretical framework and practical computational instrument for studying and assessing the risk of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) as a result of climate change. The SP resolves the long-standing parasite paradox and explains how carbon emissions in the atmosphere increase parasites' generalization and intensify host switches from animals to humans. The SP argues that the growing rate of novel EID occurrence caused by mutated zoonotic pathogens is related to the following factors brought together as a unified issue of humanity: (a) carbon emissions and consequent climate change; (b) resettlement/migration of people with hyper-urbanization; (c) overpopulation; and (d) human-induced distortion of the biosphere. The SP demonstrates that, in an evolutionary way, humans now play a role migratory birds once played in spreading parasite pathogens between the three Earth megabiotopes (northern coniferous forest belt; tropical/equatorial rainforest areas; and hot/cold deserts), i.e., the role of "super-spreaders" of parasitic viruses, bacteria, fungi and protozoa. This makes humans extremely vulnerable to the EID threat. The SP sees the +1.0-+1.2 degrees C limit as the optimal target for the slow, yet feasible curbing of the EID hazard to public health (150-200 years). Reaching merely the +2.0 degrees C level will obviously be an EID catastrophe, as it may cause two or three pandemics each year. We think it useful and advisable to include the SP-based research in the scientific repository of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, since EID appearance and spread are indirect but extremely dangerous consequences of climate change.

TI  - Spatial and temporal clusters of Barmah Forest virus disease in Queensland, Australia
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE & INTERNATIONAL HEALTH
AB  - OBJECTIVE To identify the spatial and temporal clusters of Barmah Forest virus (BFV) disease in Queensland in Australia, using geographical information systems and spatial scan statistic (SaTScan).
   METHODS We obtained BFV disease cases, population and statistical local areas (SLAs) boundary data from Queensland Health and Australian Bureau of Statistics, respectively, during 1992-2008 for Queensland. A retrospective Poisson-based analysis using SaTScan software and method was conducted to identify both purely spatial and space-time BFV disease high-rate clusters. A spatial cluster size of a proportion of the population and a 200 km radius and varying time windows from 1 to 12 months were chosen (for the space-time analysis).
   RESULTS The spatial scan statistic detected a most likely significant purely spatial cluster (including 23 SLAs) and a most likely significant space-time cluster (including 24 SLAs) in approximately the same location. Significant secondary clusters were also identified from both the analyses in several locations.
   CONCLUSIONS This study provides evidence of the existence of statistically significant BFV disease clusters in Queensland, Australia. The study also demonstrated the relevance and applicability of SaTScan in analysing ongoing surveillance data to identify clusters to facilitate the development of effective BFV disease prevention and control strategies in Queensland, Australia.

TI  - Transcriptomic landscape of hepatic lymph nodes, peripheral blood lymphocytes and spleen of swamp buffaloes infected with the tropical liver fluke <i>Fasciola gigantica</i>
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Author summaryFasciola gigantica is a socioeconomically important tropical liver fluke of mammals, causing fascioliasis-a neglected tropical disease. In the present study, RNA sequencing and bioinformatic approach were employed to explore the global transcriptional changes of hepatic lymph nodes (hLNs), peripheral blood lymphocytes (pBLs), and spleen of water buffaloes during F. gigantica infection at 3-, 42-, and 70-days post-infection (dpi). The results revealed significant transcriptional upregulation of genes associated with innate and adaptive immune responses in infected hLNs (42 and 70 dpi) and pBLs (3 and 42 dpi). However, downregulation of transcripts involved in immune response was detected in pBLs at 70 dpi. The downregulated transcripts were enriched in metabolic pathways, such as drug metabolism-cytochrome P450 in infected hLNs at 3 dpi. These findings provide new insight into the pathogenesis of F. gigantica in its natural mammalian host.
   The tropical liver fluke Fasciola gigantica is a parasitic helminth that has been frequently reported to infect mammals, typically involving water buffaloes. In this study, we characterized the tissue transcriptional landscape of buffaloes following infection by F. gigantica. RNAs were isolated from hepatic lymph nodes (hLNs), peripheral blood lymphocytes (pBLs), and spleen at 3-, 42- and 70-days post-infection (dpi), and all samples were subjected to RNA sequencing analyses. At 3 dpi, 2603, 460, and 162 differentially expressed transcripts (DETs) were detected in hLNs, pBLs, and spleen, respectively. At 42 dpi, 322, 937, and 196 DETs were detected in hLNs, pBLs, and spleen, respectively. At 70 dpi, 376, 334, and 165 DETs were detected in hLNs, pBLs, and spleen, respectively. Functional enrichment analysis identified upregulated immune-related pathways in the infected tissues involved in innate and adaptive immune responses, especially in hLNs at 42 and 70 dpi, and pBLs at 3 and 42 dpi. The upregulated transcripts in spleen were not enriched in any immune-related pathway. Co-expression network analysis further identified transcriptional changes associated with immune response to F. gigantica infection. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed that 107 genes in hLNs, 32 genes in pBLs, and 36 genes in spleen correlated with F. gigantica load. These findings provide new insight into molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways associated with F. gigantica infection in buffaloes.

TI  - Integrating support vector machine and cellular automata for modelling land cover change in the tropical rainforest under equatorial climate in Ghana
T2  - CURRENT RESEARCH IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Unsustainable anthropogenic activities such as indiscriminate logging of trees, mineral exploitation, conversion of forest into agricultural lands are known to cause major environmental changes, thereby triggering a chain of irreversible forest depletion. This has called an urgent need by government and private agencies to institute policies and programs to curtail the destruction of the ecosystem due to the pressure on the available land. In this study, the Land use/land cover changes between the period of 1986 and 2020 in the tropical rainforest of Ghana was considered. A combination of machine learning and Markov chain approach was adopted to project future LULC for 2040 and 2060.The results showed that area covered by Open Forest declined from 21,531.87 km2 to 14,518.82 km2 and Dense Forest also declined from 14,313 km2 to 8202.98 km2 over a period of 34 years. The CA-Markov model was used to predict the future land use land cover, and it was observed that the total forest cover could decline to 15,551.79 km2 in 2040 and further decrease to 13,401.79 km2 in 2060. It was also found that settlement, mining and agricultural land, which is be driven by rapid population increase, has contributed significantly to the rapid declining forest cover. The results of this study have demonstrated the impact of un-sustainable use of natural resources in these three regions. It also highlights the need for concerted effort to develop comprehensive environmental policies to encapsulate sustainable conversion and utilisation of natural resources by focusing on water-energy-food nexus.

TI  - Day Biting Habits of Mosquitoes Associated with Mangrove Forests in Kedah, Malaysia
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE
AB  - Due to conservation and rehabilitation efforts, mangrove forests represent some of the largest environmental niches in Malaysia. However, there is little information on the potential risks posed by mosquitoes that are directly and indirectly associated with mangrove forests. To study the potential health risk to humans active within and in close vicinity of mangrove forests, this research focused on the day biting habits of mosquitoes in mangrove forests of Kedah, Malaysia. The bare leg catch (BLC) method was used to collect adult mosquitoes during a 12-h period from 7:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. in both disturbed and less disturbed areas of mangroves. In total, 795 adult mosquitoes from 5 genera and 8 species were collected, and over 65% of the total mosquitoes were collected from the less disturbed area. The predominant species from the less disturbed area was Verrallina butleri; in the disturbed area the dominant species was Culex sitiens. The peak biting hour differed for each species, with Aedes albopictus and Cx. sitiens recorded as having a bimodal biting activity peak during dawn and dusk. For Ve. butleri an erratic pattern of biting activity was recorded in the less disturbed area but it peaked during the early daytime for both collection points. Overall, the distinct pattern of day biting habits of mosquitoes within mangroves peaked during dawn and dusk for the less disturbed area but was irregular for the disturbed area throughout the day. The presence of vectors of pathogens such as Ae. albopictus for both areas raises the need for authorities to consider management of mosquitoes in mangrove forests.

TI  - DIDELPHIS MARSUPIALIS, AN IMPORTANT RESERVOIR OF TRYPANOSOMA (SCHIZOTRYPANUM) CRUZI AND LEISHMANIA (LEISHMANIA) CHAGASI IN COLOMBIA
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - The role of Didelphis marsupialis as a reservoir of zoonotic hemoflagellates was examined in two ecologically distinct settings in Colombia. While 72% (12 of 18) of the opossums collected in the tropical rain forest harbored Trypanosoma cruzi, other mammals in the area had lower infection rates: 1.3% (Proechymis semispinosus [spiny rat] 13% Tylomys mirae [climbing rat]; and 6% Rattus rattus). Trypanosoma cruzi isolates from D. marsupialis were similar to zymodeme 1 (Z1), and two of four phenotypes were shared with Tylomys mirae, which is also predominantly arboreal. Terrestrial (P. semispinosus) and peridomestic (R. rattus) animals were infected with Z3 or other Z1 phenotypes, respectively. Schizodeme analysis showed polymorphisms among isolates from mammals, reflecting diverse modes of transmission, and a complex epidemiologic situation. Despite the lower infection rate of the opossum (14%) found in our study in the tropical dry forest as compared with the tropical wet forest, Chagas' disease has been reported only in the former area. This suggests that the lack of alternative blood sources for triatomines of the tropical dry forest, where mammals are less abundant than in the wet forest, may increase the risk of human infection. Among several species of mammals captured in the tropical dry forest, Leishmania chagasi was isolated from 22.7% (5 of 22) D. marsupialis. This finding confirms the important role of opossums in Colombian foci of visceral leishmaniasis, including those where the phlebotomine species involved in transmission is Lutzomyia evansi, an alternative vector to the more common Lutzomyia longipalpis.

TI  - Broadening the research landscape in the field of snakebite envenoming: Towards a holistic perspective
T2  - TOXICON
AB  - Snakebite envenoming (SBE) is a neglected tropical disease that kills and maims hundreds of thousands of people yearly, particularly in impoverished rural settings of the Global South. Understanding the complexity of SBE and tackling this disease demands a transdisciplinary, One Health approach. There is a long-standing research tradition on SBE in toxinology and human medicine. In contrast, other disciplines, such as veterinary medicine or social sciences, still need to be better developed in this field, especially in countries with a high incidence of SBE. Broadening the disciplinary landscape, connecting various research approaches, methods, and data across dis-ciplines and sectors, and engaging with communities affected by SBE in implementing evidence-based solutions are needed. This review summarizes areas that require strengthening to better understand the complexity of SBE and to generate a robust body of knowledge to be translated into effective public health interventions.

TI  - Assessing the determinants of Ebola virus disease transmission in Baka Community of the Tropical Rainforest of Cameroon
T2  - BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB  - BackgroundEbola virus disease (EVD) is a severe, often fatal illness in humans and nonhuman primates caused by the Ebola virus. The recently approved rVSV-EBOV vaccine is not available in many high-risk countries hence prevention is paramount. The design of effective prevention interventions requires an understanding of the factors that expose communities at risk. It was based on this that we investigated the Baka community of Abong-Mbang Health District in tropical rain forest of Cameroon.MethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted with participants randomly selected from 13 villages in Abong-Mbang by multi-stage cluster sampling. A questionnaire was administered to them to collect demographic information, data on knowledge of EVD, their feeding and health-seeking behaviour. Data was analyzed using the chi-square test. Knowledge of EVD was assessed using an 8 item Morisky Scale. An adapted Threat Capability Basic Risk Assessment Guide was used to determine their risk of exposure to infection.ResultsA total of 510 participants, most of whom were hunters (31.4%), farmers (29.8%), and had primary education (62.7%), were included in this study. Although 83.3% participants had heard of EVD, most (71%) did not know its cause. Their source of information was mainly informal discussions in the community (49%). Misconceptions were identified with regards to the cause and mode of transmission. Only 43.1% accepted EVD could be transmitted from human-to-human. Generally, participants' knowledge of EVD was poor. Demographic factors such as level of education, occupation and ethnic group significantly affected knowledge of EVD. The majority of participants were at a very high risk of exposure to infection as they consumed various forms of bush meat and were involved in other risky practices such as scarification and touching of corpses. Although over half of participants seek medical care, most of them preferred traditional medicine. Socio-cultural and service-related factors were deterrent factors to medical care.ConclusionParticipants generally had poor knowledge of EVD and were at high risk of infection. We recommend rigorous sensitization campaigns in the study area to educate the population on EVD and clarify the misconceptions identified. EVD surveillance is recommended particularly as outbreaks have often been reported in the Congo Basin.

TI  - Diseases and insect pests challenge to meet wood production demand of <i>Tectona grandis</i> (L.), a high-value tropical tree species
T2  - JOURNAL OF PLANT DISEASES AND PROTECTION
AB  - Tectona grandis L. (teak) is one of the cherished heritage tropical hardwood species that belongs to the Lamiaceae family. It is a large deciduous tree native to India, Myanmar and Thailand. The natural populations of teak remain an important source from the economic, ecological and environmental perspectives. Teak timber is well known for its quality in terms of durability and market value. It is naturally resistant to various biotic stress components due to the presence of tectoquinone, lapachol and deoxy lapachol; however, it takes a minimum of 20-25 years for the production of marketable wood to fetch high returns. This long haul provides sufficient time for pests and diseases to feast upon teak at various growth stages starting from nursery to timber mills which leads to a downturn in timber production. To meet the rising demand from wood industries, it is essential to manage the health of the teak plantation outside forests. The reports of new pests and diseases on teak escalated since 2010, especially from countries like Brazil and Mexico where we witness recent rise in commercial teak forests, and this vulnerability emphasizes the deployment of protection measures right from the supply of quality planting material. The update on the biotic factors comprising insect pests, fungal and bacterial infections, which are currently limiting teak wood production, will supplement the efforts involved in quality planting material production. Identification of plus trees with genetic resistance, molecular characterization and monitoring of pests and diseases on teak harnessing the recent developments in plant protection, along with the research on development of the package of practices for teak nurseries and plantation management, will only sustain teak production in near future.

TI  - Human seroprevalence indicating hantavirus infections in tropical rainforests of Cote d'Ivoire and Democratic Republic of Congo
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Hantaviruses are members of the Bunyaviridae family carried by small mammals and causing human hemorrhagic fevers worldwide. In Western Africa, where a variety of hemorrhagic fever viruses occurs, indigenous hantaviruses have been molecularly found in animal reservoirs such as rodents, shrews, and bats since 2006. To investigate the human contact to hantaviruses carried by these hosts and to assess the public health relevance of hantaviruses for humans living in the tropical rainforest regions of Western and Central Africa, we performed a cross-sectional seroprevalence study in the region of TaI National Park in Cote d'Ivoire and the Bandundu region near the Salonga National Park in the Democratic Republic (DR) of Congo. Serum samples were initially screened with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays using nucleoproteins of several hantaviruses as diagnostic antigens. Positive results were confirmed by Western blotting and immunofluorescence testing. Seroprevalence rates of 3.9% (27/687) and 2.4% (7/295), respectively, were found in the investigated regions in Cote d'Ivoire and the DR Congo. In Cote d'Ivoire, this value was significantly higher than the seroprevalence rates previously reported from the neighboring country Guinea as well as from South Africa. Our study indicates an exposure of humans to hantaviruses in West and Central African tropical rainforest areas. In order to pinpoint the possible existence and frequency of clinical disease caused by hantaviruses in this region of the world, systematic investigations of patients with fever and renal or respiratory symptoms are required.

TI  - <i>Rickettsia</i> spp. in ticks from a tropical dry forest reserve on Mexico's Pacific Coast
T2  - TICKS AND TICK-BORNE DISEASES
AB  - The present study analyzes the diversity of bacteria of the genus Rickettsia in ticks collected from wild mammals and vegetation at the Chamela Biological Station (EBCh), Jalisco, Mexico, a core area in the Chamela-Cuixmala Biosphere Reserve, which is characterized by the presence of tropical dry forest, one of the most threatened ecosystems in the world. Ticks were collected during April and November 2018 and 2019, determined to species, and subsequently processed for rickettsiae. Genomic DNA was extracted from each of 349 ticks (198 from mammals, 151 from vegetation) and screened for Rickettsia by targeting the gltA and ompA genes. Overall, 75 ticks (21.5%) were positive for rickettsiae (46 from mammals, 29 from vegetation). Through BLASTn and maximum likelihood analysis, four Rickettsia taxa were identified. Only Rickettsia amblyommatis had been previously recorded in the vicinity of the EBCh, and we confirm its presence in this reserve, associated with Amblyomma mixtum, Amblyomma cf. oblongoguttatum and Amblyomma parvum. Additionally, we record for the first time at EBCh the taxa Rickettsia parkeri strain Atlantic rainforest, which is known to cause spotted fever illness in humans, detected in Amblyomma ovale; Rickettsia bellii in A. parvum and Ornithodoros talaje; and an undescribed Rickettsia sp. in Ixodes sinaloa.

TI  - Landscape Physiognomy Influences Abundance of the Lone Star Tick, <i>Amblyomma americanum</i> (Ixodida: Ixodidae), in Ozark Forests
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - The lone star tick, Amblyomma americanum Linnaeus (Ixodida: Ixodidae), is emerging as an important human disease vector in the United States. While some recent studies have modeled broad-scale (regional or county-level) distribution patterns of A. americanum, less is known about how local-scale habitat characteristics drive A. americanum abundance. Such local-scale information is vital to identify targets for tick population control measures within land management units. We investigated how habitat features predict host-seeking A. americanum adult and nymph abundance within a 12-ha oak-hickory forest plot in the Missouri Ozarks. We trapped ticks using CO2-baited traps at 40 evenly spaced locations for three 24-h periods during the summer of 2015, and we measured biotic and abiotic variables surrounding each location. Of 2,008 A. americanum captured, 1,009 were nymphs, and 999 were adults. We observed spatial heterogeneity in local tick abundance (min = 0 ticks, max = 112 ticks, mean = 16.7 ticks per trap night). Using generalized linear mixed models, we found that both nymphs and adults had greater abundance in valleys as well as on northern-facing aspects. Moreover, nymph abundance was negatively related to temperature variance, while adult abundance had a negative relationship with elevation. These results demonstrate that managers in this region may be able to predict local tick abundance through simple physiognomic factors and use these parameters for targeted management action.

TI  - Pathology and epidemiology of fatal toxoplasmosis in free-ranging marmosets (<i>Callithrix</i> spp.) from the Brazilian atlantic forest
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Toxoplasmosis is an important zoonotic disease that affects a wide range of warm-blooded host species. Neotropical primates (New World Primates; NWP) are highly susceptible, developing a lethal acute systemic disease. Toxoplasmosis in free-ranging NWP is poorly described, with only a few studies based on serosurveys. Herein we performed a retrospective study focusing on the epidemiology and pathology of toxoplasmosis among 1,001 free-ranging marmoset (Callithrix spp.) deaths from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. This study included marmosets necropsied at the Instituto Municipal de Medicina Veterinaria Jorge Vaitsman (IJV) from January 2017 to July 2019, which were found dead from all regions in the State of Rio de Janeiro. Histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and transmission electron microscopy were performed to better characterize toxoplasmosis in this free-ranging population. All samples were also tested for Yellow Fever Virus (YFV) RT-qPCR by the official diagnostic service. A total of 1,001 free-ranging marmosets were included in this study, with 16 (1.6%) cases of lethal Toxoplasma gondii infections identified both as individual cases and in outbreaks. Presence of infection was not associated with sex, age, geographical distribution, or year of death, and no co-infection with YFV was observed. The main pathological feature in these cases was random necrotizing hepatitis with detection of intralesional T. gondiizoites in all infected cases. Interstitial pneumonia rich in alveolar foamy macrophages and fibrin deposition, necrotizing myocarditis and necrotizing splenitis were also pathological features in affected marmosets. Therefore, toxoplasmosis was considered the cause of death in 1.6% of free-ranging marmosets in this retrospective series, including some cases associated with outbreaks. Necrotizing random hepatitis was a consistent pathological finding in affected cases and sampling of liver should be ensured from Callitrichid post mortem cases.

TI  - A Hybrid Intelligence System Based on Relevance Vector Machines and Imperialist Competitive Optimization for Modelling Forest Fire Danger Using GIS
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATICS
AB  - This article proposes and verifies a novel intelligence approach for modelling forest fire danger developed based on a hybrid model of Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (ICA) and Relevance Vector Machine (RVM). The hybrid model is named as ICA-RVM. They are state-of-the-art machine learning techniques that have not been investigated for forest fire danger modeling. RVM is used to establish a prediction model that computes probability of fire danger, whereas ICA is adopted to optimize the predict ion model. The tropical forest at Gia Lai province, Central Highland (Vietnam), was used as a case study. A geographic information system (GIS) database featuring 12 fire ignition factors has been established to train and verify the hybrid intelligence model. Area under the curve (AUC) and statistical measures were used to assess the model performance. The result showed that the proposed model achieves high performances; AUC is 0.842 and 0.793 on the training dataset and the validation dataset, respectively. Compared to two benchmarks, Random Forests and Support Vector Machine, the proposed model performs better. Therefore, the propose ICA-RVM is a valid alternative system for forest fire danger modeling.

TI  - Genomic signals of diversification along ecological gradients in a tropical lizard
T2  - MOLECULAR ECOLOGY
AB  - Studies of rainforest diversification that simultaneously consider the effects of genetic drift and natural selection are rare. We use Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism genome scans of the African rainforest lizard Trachylepis affinis from Cameroon to examine the spatial patterns and environmental associations of both neutrally evolving loci and those thought to be under selection. Bayesian selection scans revealed that approximately 7% of the genome may be under divergent selection. Using non-linear environmental modelling techniques, we fit patterns of genetic differentiation recovered from the pooled neutral data and from individual loci showing a signature of natural selection. Neutral differentiation occurred along a cline from coastal lowland rainforest inland toward the gallery forests-savanna mosaic (ecotone), and was associated with both geographic distance and changing precipitation patterns. Loci under selection were differentiated predominantly along the forest-ecotone gradient-in concordance with morphological divergence in traits related to fitness. A second set of these loci was differentiated between lowland and montane habitats. A third set of loci was indicative of divergent selection between rainforest refugia. Niche models and demographic signals in mitochondrial sequence data support a population expansion out of a core rainforest area into savanna since the last glacial maximum. Our findings indicate adaptive diversification in T. affinis may be taking place along the forest-ecotone gradient during range expansions or contractions, and that refugial isolation augmented by divergent adaptation to different rainforest environments appears to play a less significant role.

TI  - Forest cover maps of China in 2010 from multiple approaches and data sources: PALSAR, Landsat, MODIS, FRA, and NFI
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Forests and their changes are important to the regional and global carbon cycle, biodiversity and ecosystem services. Some uncertainty about forest cover area in China calls for an accurate and updated forest cover map. In this study, we combined ALOS PALSAR orthorectified 50-m mosaic images (FED mode with HH and HV polarization) and MODIS time series data in 2010 to map forests in China. We used MODIS-based NDVI dataset (MOD13Q1, 250-m spatial resolution) to generate a map of annual maximum NDVI and used it to mask out built-up lands, barren lands, and sparsely vegetated lands. We developed a decision tree classification algorithm to identify forest and non-forest land cover, based on the signature analysis of PALSAR backscatter coefficient data. The PALSAR-based algorithm was then applied to produce a forest cover map in China in 2010. The resulting forest/non-forest classification map has an overall accuracy of 96.2% and a Kappa Coefficient of 0.91. The resultant 50-m PALSAR-based forest cover map was compared to five forest cover databases. The total forest area (2.02 x 10(6) km(2)) in China from the PALSAR-based forest map is close to the forest area estimates from China National Forestry Inventory (1.95 x 10(6) km(2)), JAXA (2.00 x 10(6) km(2)), and FAO FRA (2.07 x 10(6) km(2)). There are good linear relationships between the PALSAR-based forest map and the forest maps from the JAXA, MCD12Q1, and NLCD-China datasets at the province and county scales. All the forest maps have similar spatial distributions of forest/non-forest at pixel scale. Our PALSAR-based forest map recognizes well the agro-forests in China. The results of this study demonstrate the potential of integrating PALSAR and MODIS images to map forests in large areas. The resultant map of forest cover in China in 2010 can be used for many studies such as forest carbon cycle and ecological restoration.

TI  - Disease: A Hitherto Unexplored Constraint on the Spread of Dogs (<i>Canis lupus familiaris</i>) in Pre-Columbian South America
T2  - JOURNAL OF WORLD PREHISTORY
AB  - Although debate continues, there is agreement that dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) were first domesticated in Eurasia, spreading from there to other parts of the world. However, while that expansion already extended as far as Europe, China, and North America by the early Holocene, dogs spread into (and south of) the tropics only much later. In South America, for example, the earliest well-attested instances of their presence do not reach back much beyond 3000 cal. BC, and dogs were still absent from large parts of the continent-Amazonia, the Gran Chaco, and much of the Southern Cone-at European contact. Previous explanations for these patterns have focused on cultural choice, the unsuitability of dogs for hunting certain kinds of tropical forest prey, and otherwise unspecified environmental hazards, while acknowledging that Neotropical lowland forests witness high rates of canine mortality. Building on previous work in sub-Saharan Africa (Mitchell in Archaeol Res Afr 50: 92-135, 2015), and noting that the dog's closest relatives, the grey wolf (C. lupus) and the coyote (C. latrans), were likewise absent from South and most of Central America in pre-Columbian times, this paper explores instead the possibility that infectious disease constrained the spread of dogs into Neotropical environments. Four diseases are considered, all likely to be native and/or endemic to South America: canine distemper, canine trypanosomiasis, canine rangeliosis, and canine visceral leishmaniasis caused by infection with Leishmania amazonensis and L. colombiensis. The paper concludes by suggesting ways in which the hypothesis that disease constrained the expansion of dogs into South America can be developed further.

TI  - COVID-19: should forestry extension pay attention to new emerging threats?
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
AB  - Increasing frequency of zoonotic diseases put the human populations in and around the biodiversity-rich tropical forests under constant risk of epidemic outbreak. However, an integrated strategy for awareness and development and real-time data gathering from among the susceptible localities are wanting. We suggest widening the scope of forestry and wildlife extension programmes to address this challenge by adopting the principles of One Health approach in combating zoonosis.

TI  - Xenosurveillance: A Novel Mosquito-Based Approach for Examining the Human-Pathogen Landscape
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   Globally, regions at the highest risk for emerging infectious diseases are often the ones with the fewest resources. As a result, implementing sustainable infectious disease surveillance systems in these regions is challenging. The cost of these programs and difficulties associated with collecting, storing and transporting relevant samples have hindered them in the regions where they are most needed. Therefore, we tested the sensitivity and feasibility of a novel surveillance technique called xenosurveillance. This approach utilizes the host feeding preferences and behaviors of Anopheles gambiae, which are highly anthropophilic and rest indoors after feeding, to sample viruses in human beings. We hypothesized that mosquito bloodmeals could be used to detect vertebrate viral pathogens within realistic field collection timeframes and clinically relevant concentrations.
   Methodology/Principal Findings
   To validate this approach, we examined variables influencing virus detection such as the duration between mosquito blood feeding and mosquito processing, the pathogen nucleic acid stability in the mosquito gut and the pathogen load present in the host's blood at the time of bloodmeal ingestion using our laboratory model. Our findings revealed that viral nucleic acids, at clinically relevant concentrations, could be detected from engorged mosquitoes for up to 24 hours post feeding by qRT-PCR. Subsequently, we tested this approach in the field by examining blood from engorged mosquitoes from two field sites in Liberia. Using next-generation sequencing and PCR we were able to detect the genetic signatures of multiple viral pathogens including Epstein-Barr virus and canine distemper virus.
   Conclusions/Significance
   Together, these data demonstrate the feasibility of xenosurveillance and in doing so validated a simple and non-invasive surveillance tool that could be used to complement current biosurveillance efforts.

TI  - Automated classification of a tropical landscape infested by Parthenium weed (Parthenium hyterophorus)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
AB  - The invasive Parthenium weed (Parthenium hyterophorus) adversely affects animal and human health, agricultural productivity, rural livelihoods, local and national economies, and the environment. Its fast spreading capability requires consistent monitoring for adoption of relevant mitigation approaches, potentially through remote sensing. To date, studies that have endeavoured to map the Parthenium weed have commonly used popular classification algorithms that include support vector machines and random forest classifiers, which do not capture the complex structural characteristics of the weed. Furthermore, determination of site or data specific algorithms, often achieved through intensive comparison of algorithms, is often laborious and time consuming. In addition, selected algorithms may not be optimal on datasets collected in other sites. Hence, this study adopted the Tree-based Pipeline Optimization Tool (TPOT), an automated machine learning approach that can be used to overcome high data variability during the classification process. Using Sentinel-2 and Land Satellite (Landsat) 8 imagery to map Parthenium weed, we compared the outcome of the TPOT to the best performing and optimized algorithm selected from sixteen classifiers on different training datasets. Results showed that the TPOT model yielded a higher overall classification accuracy (88.15%) using Sentinel-2 and 74% using Landsat 8, accuracies that were higher than the commonly used robust classifiers. This study is the first to demonstrate the value of TPOT in mapping Parthenium weed infestations using satellite imagery. Its adoption would therefore be useful in limiting human intervention while optimizing classification accuracies for mapping invasive plants. Based on these findings, we propose TPOT as an efficient method for selecting and tuning algorithms for Parthenium discrimination and monitoring, and indeed general vegetation mapping.

TI  - Socio-economic factors affecting sustainable utilization of woody species in Zegie Peninsula, northwestern Ethiopia
T2  - TROPICAL ECOLOGY
AB  - Zegie Peninsula contains a remnant dry Afromontane forest, where about 90 % was previously classified as dense forest. Recently, the forest cover is significantly reduced. Zegie has a high density of 643 persons km(-2), predominantly inhabited by religious people, priests and monks. The aim of the study was to understand the dynamics of socioeconomic and resource management factors affecting the sustainable use of woody species in the peninsula and gain a window into the world of isolated religious communities and their complex and evolving relationships with forests. A formal survey of 60 households (4 % of population) was conducted where cross-section data were gathered through a pre-coded (structured) questionnaire. The results revealed that household characteristics, household endowment (farm resources ownership), choice of livelihood strategy and farming constraints affect attitudes and behaviours towards sustainable use of tree resources. Poorer households had smaller resource ownership, were female-headed and illiterate. They also had younger and smaller family sizes and a desire to have more children. Hence, they are not likely to practice family planning contributing to increasing overpopulation. They experienced acute shortage of land and also felt tenure insecurity. Perhaps because they cannot afford fertilizers and pesticides, soil fertility as well as pests and diseases are serious constraints for them. Owing to shortage of land and tenure insecurity, among other things, they have not planted trees in the past and are not likely to plant trees in the future. Much of their income comes from wood selling, therefore, are likely to engage in deforestation. They have diversified their livelihood into artisanship, cloth weaving, and fishing but are limited by low skill, capital, and access to market. The strategy to save the remaining forests in the peninsula, therefore, should include reducing the proportion of poorer households. In order to achieve this objective, a three pronged approach is required: (1) improving access to resource ownership; (2) removing or minimizing farming constraints; and (3) creating enabling environment for families to engage in diversified livelihood strategies.

TI  - A participatory epidemiological and One Health approach to explore the community's capacity to detect emerging zoonoses and surveillance network opportunities in the forest region of Guinea
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - The Ebola virus disease epidemic that threatened West Africa between 2013 and 2016 was of unprecedented health magnitude. After this health crisis, studies highlighted the need to introduce community-based surveillance systems and to adopt a One Health approach. This study aimed to provide preparatory insights for the definition of a community-based surveillance system for emerging zoonoses such as viral hemorrhagic fevers in Guinea. The objective was to explore the disease detection capacity and the surveillance network opportunities at the community level in two pilot areas in the forest region of Guinea, where the epidemic emerged. Based on a participatory epidemiological and One Health approach, we conducted Focus Group Discussions with human, animal and ecosystem health actors. We used a range of participatory tools, included semi-structured interviews, ranking, scoring and flow diagram, to estimate the local knowledge and perception of diseases and clinical signs and to investigate the existing health information exchange network and its related strengths and weaknesses. The results showed that there is heterogeneity in knowledge of diseases and perception of the clinical signs among actors and that there are preferred and more effective health communication channels opportunities. This preparatory study suggests that it is necessary to adapt the case definitions and the health communication channels to the different actors who can play a role in a future community-based surveillance system and provides recommendations for future surveillance activities to be carried out in West Africa.
   Author summary
   Viral hemorrhagic diseases have a high risk of emergence in tropical regions. The consequences on public health are often disastrous in the low- and middle-income countries that face difficulties to control epidemics. This scenario has unfortunately occurred in West Africa between 2013 and 2016 with the Ebola virus disease epidemic. There is an urgent need to increase the capacity for rapid detection of the emergence of such diseases and adopting a One Health approach since most of them are zoonotic. Community-based surveillance seems appropriate to address this issue in the context of these countries. We collected preparatory data through semi-structured interviews of community actors in human health, animal health and ecosystem health in Guinea. We used participatory epidemiology that appears to be a consistent method to assess local knowledge and perceptions of diseases and clinical signs and to identify health information exchange network opportunities. We aimed to provide relevant recommendations for the design of adapted case definitions and surveillance network in the prospect of implementing a communitybased surveillance system of viral hemorrhagic fevers in Guinea and future surveillance activities to be carried out in West Africa.

TI  - A novel ensemble modeling approach for the spatial prediction of tropical forest fire susceptibility using LogitBoost machine learning classifier and multi-source geospatial data
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
AB  - A reliable forest fire susceptibility map is a necessity for disaster management and a primary reference source in land use planning. We set out to evaluate the use of the LogitBoost ensemble-based decision tree (LEDT) machine learning method for forest fire susceptibility mapping through a comparative case study at the Lao Cai region of Vietnam. A thorough literature search would indicate the method has not previously been applied to forest fires. Support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and Kernel logistic regression (KLR) were used as benchmarks in the comparative evaluation. A fire inventory database for the study area was constructed based on data of previous forest fire occurrences, and related conditioning factors were generated from a number of sources. Thereafter, forest fire probability indices were computed through each of the four modeling techniques, and performances were compared using the area under the curve (AUC), Kappa index, overall accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV). The LEDT model produced the best performance, both on the training and on validation datasets, demonstrating a 92% prediction capability. Its overall superiority over the benchmarking models suggests that it has the potential to be used as an efficient new tool for forest fire susceptibility mapping. Fire prevention is a critical concern for local forestry authorities in tropical Lao Cai region, and based on the evidence of our study, the method has a potential application in forestry conservation management.

TI  - The grand challenge of great ape health and conservation in the anthropocene
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY
AB  - "Ecosystem Health recognizes the inherent interdependence of the health of humans, animals and ecosystems and explores the perspectives, theories and methodologies emerging at the interface between ecological and health sciences." This broad focus requires new approaches and methods for solving problems of greater complexity at larger scales than ever before. Nowhere is this point more salient than the case of disease emergence and control at the human-non human primate interface in shrinking tropical forests under great anthropogenic pressure. This special edition brings together transdisciplinary experts who have created successful partnerships leading to advances in ecosystem approaches to health for wild ape populations with relevance to all developing country tropical forest environments. It is no coincidence that the advances herein highlight two long term health projectsthe Gombe Ecosystem Health Project (Gombe National Park, Tanzania), and the Tai Chimpanzee Project (TCP) in Cote d'Ivoire since standardizing and validating noninvasive disease surveillance, risk assessment and management methods presents a special series of challenges where time is a major factor. Advances highlighted in this addition include: health surveillance and monitoring, health risk analysis, field immobilization and interventions, human-NHP networks/interfaces, diagnostic tool development, and cutting edge molecular and genetic techniques.

TI  - Climatic and landscape correlates for potential West Nile virus mosquito vectors in the Seattle region
T2  - JOURNAL OF VECTOR ECOLOGY
AB  - Climatic and landscape patterns have been associated with both relative mosquito abundance and transmission of mosquito-borne illnesses in many parts of the world, especially warm and tropical climes. To determine if temperature, precipitation, or degree of urbanization were similarly important in the number of potential mosquito vectors for West Nile virus in the moderately temperate climate of western Washington, mosquitoes were collected using CDC carbondioxide/light traps set throughout the Seattle region during the summers of 2003 and 2004. The type and abundance of recovered species were compared to ecological correlates. Temperature and mosquito abundance were positively correlated, while precipitation was not strongly correlated with numbers of mosquitoes. Potential WNV mosquito vectors were most abundant in urban and suburban sites, including sites near communal roosts of American crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos). Exurban sites had the greatest vector species diversity, and Culex pipiens was the most abundant species throughout the region.

TI  - Assemblage variation of mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) in different land use and activity periods within a lowland tropical forest matrix in Campeche, Mexico
T2  - JOURNAL OF VECTOR ECOLOGY
AB  - Most mosquito species are active during a certain part of the day, but climatic factors such as light intensity and relative humidity play an important role in the control of their activity. We selected three types of land use that were sampled in state of Campeche in 2018 (low semi-evergreen forest, secondary low semi-evergreen forest, and mango plantation), using ten CDC light traps baited with CO2, that were active during nine hours of three activity periods (dawn, noon, and nightfall). A GLM was used to investigate changes in the assembly of mosquitoes between different types of land use and temporal variations. Rank abundance curves were used to detect changes in the spatial and activity period of the mosquitoes and we then calculated the Exponential Shannon Index. A total of 6,110 mosquitoes belonging to 23 species were captured. The greatest richness and abundance were found in the secondary low semi-evergreen forest, with greater richness and lower abundance than the mango plantation which showed more abundance. Of the activity periods, dusk had the greatest abundance and richness followed by dawn and finally noon.

TI  - Multiple-scale spatial distribution of the fungal epiphyll <i>Scolecopeltidium</i> on <i>Trichilia</i> spp. in two lowland moist tropical forests
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE BOTANIQUE
AB  - The leaf-inhabiting fungus Scolecopeltidium mayteni (Micropeltaceae) is common on Trichilia tuberculata in lowland tropical forests on Barro Colorado Island, Panama, and on Trichilia moritzii in Corcovado National Park, Costa Pica. The sexual reproductive structures (ascomata) of the fungus have a clumped or random distribution on leaflet surfaces. The density of ascomata correlates well with the density of hyphae on the leaf surface and is a good indicator of the intensity of fungal colonization. Most of the variability in colonization is at a leaf-to-leaf level rather than among leaflets or among plants. Intensity of fungal colonization is directly related to the light environment of the leaflet or plant, but not to the density of hosts. The Scolecopeltidium-Trichilia system is well suited for studies on ecological factors affecting host-fungal symbioses in natural plant communities.

TI  - Seasonality of the gut microbiota of free-ranging white-faced capuchins in a tropical dry forest
T2  - ISME JOURNAL
AB  - Research on the gut microbiota of free-ranging mammals is offering new insights into dietary ecology. However, for free ranging primates, little information is available for how microbiomes are influenced by ecological variation through time. Primates inhabiting seasonal tropical dry forests undergo seasonally specific decreases in food abundance and water availability, which have been linked to adverse health effects. Throughout the course of a seasonal transition in 2014, we collected fecal samples from three social groups of free-ranging white-faced capuchin monkeys (Cebus capucinus imitator) in Sector Santa Rosa, Area de Conservacion Guanacaste, Costa Rica. 16S rRNA sequencing data reveal that unlike other primates, the white-faced capuchin monkey gut is dominated by Bifidobacterium and Streptococcus. Linear mixed effects models indicate that abundances of these genera are associated with fluctuating availability and consumption of fruit and arthropods, whereas beta diversity clusters by rainfall season. Whole shotgun metagenomics revealed that the capuchin gut is dominated by carbohydrate-binding modules associated with digestion of plant polysaccharides and chitin, matching seasonal dietary patterns. We conclude that rainfall and diet are associated with the diversity, composition, and function of the capuchin gut microbiome. Additionally, microbial fluctuations are likely contributing to nutrient uptake and the health of wild primate populations.

TI  - Disturbance and mosquito diversity in the lowland tropical rainforest of central Panama
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - The Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis (IDH) is well-known in ecology providing an explanation for the role of disturbance in the coexistence of climax and colonist species. Here, we used the IDH as a framework to describe the role of forest disturbance in shaping the mosquito community structure, and to identify the ecological processes that increase the emergence of vector-borne disease. Mosquitoes were collected in central Panama at immature stages along linear transects in colonising, mixed and climax forest habitats, representing different levels of disturbance. Species were identified taxonomically and classified into functional categories (i.e., colonist, climax, disturbance-generalist, and rare). Using the Huisman-Olff-Fresco multi-model selection approach, IDH testing was done. We did not detect a unimodal relationship between species diversity and forest disturbance expected under the IDH; instead diversity peaked in old-growth forests. Habitat complexity and constraints are two mechanisms proposed to explain this alternative postulate. Moreover, colonist mosquito species were more likely to be involved in or capable of pathogen transmission than climax species. Vector species occurrence decreased notably in undisturbed forest settings. Old-growth forest conservation in tropical rainforests is therefore a highly-recommended solution for preventing new outbreaks of arboviral and parasitic diseases in anthropic environments.

TI  - Leaf shedding and weather in tropical dry-seasonal forest shape the phenology of fungi - Lessons from two years of monthly surveys in southwestern Panama
T2  - FUNGAL ECOLOGY
AB  - In the present study, conducted in a secondary dry-seasonal forest in the pacific lowlands of southwestern Panama over 2 years, fungal diversity is linked to plant phenology, litter, and climatic data. Agaricales fungi showed maximum species richness at the beginning of rainy seasons, probably due to the important litter accumulation during the dry season and the increase in humidity favoring fungal growth. Species richness declined during the wet season possibly due to torrential rains, moulds, and decreasing availability of nutrients. Occurrence of foliar pathogenic microfungi correlated negatively with flushing of new leaves at the beginning of the rainy season. Their incidence increased during the wet season and remained high during the dry season. Synchronization of leaf shedding in most tree species significantly reduced the yearly incidence of foliar pathogenic fungi causing an annual turn-over of fungal pathogens that probably contributes to maintain a high diversity of plant pathogenic species.

TI  - Automated classification of tropical shrub species: a hybrid of leaf shape and machine learning approach
T2  - PEERJ
AB  - Plants play a crucial role in foodstuff, medicine, industry, and environmental protection. The skill of recognising plants is very important in some applications, including conservation of endangered species and rehabilitation of lands after mining activities. However, it is a difficult task to identify plant species because it requires specialized knowledge. Developing an automated classification system for plant species is necessary and valuable since it can help specialists as well as the public in identifying plant species easily. Shape descriptors were applied on the myDAUN dataset that contains 45 tropical shrub species collected from the University of Malaya (UM), Malaysia. Based on literature review, this is the first study in the development of tropical shrub species image dataset and classification using a hybrid of leaf shape and machine learning approach. Four types of shape descriptors were used in this study namely morphological shape descriptors (MSD), Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), Hu invariant moments (Hu) and Zernike moments (ZM). Single descriptor, as well as the combination of hybrid descriptors were tested and compared. The tropical shrub species are classified using six different classifiers, which are artificial neural network (ANN), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbour (k -NN), linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and directed acyclic graph multiclass least squares twin support vector machine (DAG MLSTSVM). In addition, three types of feature selection methods were tested in the myDAUN dataset, Relief, Correlation -based feature selection (CFS) and Pearson's coefficient correlation (PCC). The well-known Flavia dataset and Swedish Leaf dataset were used as the validation dataset on the proposed methods. The results showed that the hybrid of all descriptors of ANN outperformed the other classifiers with an average classification accuracy of 98.23% for the myDAUN dataset, 95.25% for the Flavia dataset and 99.89% for the Swedish Leaf dataset. In addition, the Relief feature selection method achieved the highest classification accuracy of 98.13% after 80 (or 60%) of the original features were reduced, from 133 to 53 descriptors in the myDAUN dataset with the reduction in computational time. Subsequently, the hybridisation of four descriptors gave the best results compared to others. It is proven that the combination MSD and HOG were good enough for tropical shrubs species classification. Hu and ZM descriptors also improved the accuracy in tropical shrubs species classification in terms of invariant to translation, rotation and scale. ANN outperformed the others for tropical shrub species classification in this study. Feature selection methods can be used in the classification of tropical shrub species, as the comparable results could be obtained with the reduced descriptors and reduced in computational time and cost.

TI  - Inter-specific gene flow dynamics during the Pleistocene-dated speciation of forest-dependent mosquitoes in Southeast Asia
T2  - MOLECULAR ECOLOGY
AB  - Tropical forests have undergone repeated fragmentation and expansion during Pleistocene glacial and interglacial periods, respectively. The effects of this repeated forest fragmentation in driving vicariance in tropical taxa have been well studied. However, relatively little is known about how often this process results in allopatric speciation, since it may be inhibited by recurrent gene flow during repeated secondary contact, or to what extent Pleistocene-dated speciation results from ecological specialization in the face of gene flow. Here, divergence times and gene flow between three closely-related mosquito species of the Anopheles dirus species complex endemic to the forests of Southeast Asia, are inferred using coalescent based Bayesian analysis. An Isolation with Migration model is applied to sequences of two mitochondrial and three nuclear genes, and 11 microsatellites. The divergence of An. scanloni has occurred despite unidirectional nuclear gene flow from this species into An. dirus. The inferred asymmetric gene flow may result from the unique evolutionary adaptation of An. scanloni to limestone karst habitat, and therefore the fitness advantage of this species over An. dirus in regions of sympatry. Mitochondrial introgression has led to the complete replacement of An. dirus haplotypes with those of An. baimaii through a recent (similar to 62 kya) selective sweep. Speciation of An. baimaii and An. dirus is inferred to have involved allopatric divergence throughout much of the Pleistocene. Secondary contact and bidirectional gene flow has occurred only within the last 100 000 years, by which time the process of allopatric speciation seems to have been largely completed.

TI  - The utility of mosquito-borne disease as an environmental monitoring tool in tropical ecosystems
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING
AB  - The intrinsic link between ecosystem health and human health has been firmly established in the literature and has given rise to the development of new multidisciplinary fields of research such as medical geology. An important practical implication of the ecosystem health approach is the utility of human disease outbreaks as indicators of underlying ecosystem disruption. The use of such a bioindicator is particularly relevant in developing countries where monitoring of traditional environmental and ecological indicators is not routinely undertaken. Mosquito-borne diseases appear to have good potential as bioindicators in tropical regions because the burden of disease is high, the disease ecology has a strong environmental component and intensive surveillance systems are well established. Evidence is reviewed regarding the utility of mosquito-borne disease to detect a range of ecosystem insults including: hydro-geological disruption in soil-water systems (e.g. secondary soil salinisation and waterlogging); escalating agricultural intensification; deforestation; and urbanisation. The evidence suggests that overall, mosquito-borne disease is a specific but insensitive indicator, because human modification of natural ecosystems does not always result in increases in disease incidence and can, in some cases, lead to reductions. Nevertheless, mosquito-borne disease remain useful as bioindicators if utilised as a complement to traditional environmental variables in identifying ecological disturbances; they can then assist in directing interventions that are concurrently beneficial to both human health and ecosystem health.

TI  - Tree species identification in ex situ conservation areas using WorldView-2 Satellite Data and Machine Learning Methods: a case study in the Bogor Botanic Garden
T2  - TROPICAL ECOLOGY
AB  - Spatially-explicit data on the species composition of forest plants can be an important tool for forest management and conservation. One specific application of these data is for identifying tropical tree species through machine learning techniques to classify satellite remote sensing images. This study aims to examine the ability to use Worldview-2 high-resolution data with various machine learning methods to identify tree species in the Bogor Botanic Garden. Eighteen species from 11 families were selected as samples representing an ecologically and taxonomically diverse data set. Using aggregated image variables, each tree species was found to have different reflectance, texture, and spectral vegetation index variable values. Cluster analysis showed that the 18 tree species could be separated into three clusters that partly reflected taxonomic relationships. Four machine learning algorithms (Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), and Bayesian) were used to predict the species identity of pixels in the image data. A multicollinearity test using a Variance Inflation Factor method reduced the predictor variables from 54 to 9. The highest accuracy (0.96) was observed using SVM, followed by RF (0.91), KNN (0.86), and Bayesian (0.74). The implementation of high-resolution satellite imagery and machine learning for species identification in tropical ex situ plant conservation areas, such as botanic gardens is reported here for the first time.

AB  - Surveys of bats were conducted at six regenerated forest sampling sites, namely, Sungai Dusun Forest Reserve (FR), Fraser Hill FR, Lata Bujang FR, Tasek Bera FR, Endau- Kluang FR and Endau-Kota Tinggi FR. A total of 289 individuals representing 35 species of bats were recorded. Endau- Kota Tinggi FR was the most diverse (Fisher's alpha = 9.95) while Endau- Kluang FR, the least diverse (Fisher's alpha = 3.17). Six species of bats, namely, Dyacopterus spadiceus, Nycteris tragata, Rhinolophus sedulus, Kerivoula intermedia, K. pellucida and Myotis ridleyi are listed as near threatened. Two species of bats, Hipposideros ridleyi and Arielulus societatis, are listed as vulnerable and facing high risk of extinction in the wild. The diversity of chiropterans in generated forest was high and was underestimated because of lack of information on those high flier species in and above canopy levels.

Here, we train and validate three machine learning algorithms, namely Random Forest, Artificial Neural Network, and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) using the airborne polarimetric SAR data acquired during the AfriSAR UAVSAR campaign. From the evaluation of model performance, it is observed that these machine learning models were to retrieve AGB values with reasonable accuracies. The RF performed better estimation with R-2=0.97 and RMSE=28.52 Mg/ha for training sites, however its computational cost was high compared to other models.

TI  - Limited Effects of Type I Interferons on Kyasanur Forest Disease Virus in Cell Culture
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   The tick-borne flavivirus, Kyasanur Forest disease virus (KFDV) causes seasonal infections and periodic outbreaks in south-west India. The current vaccine offers poor protection with reported issues of coverage and immunogenicity. Since there are no approved prophylactic therapeutics for KFDV, type I IFN-alpha/beta subtypes were assessed for antiviral potency against KFDV in cell culture.
   Methodology/Principal Findings
   The continued passage of KFDV-infected cells with re-administered IFN-alpha 2a treatment did not eliminate KFDV and had little effect on infectious particle production whereas the IFN-sensitive, green fluorescent protein-expressing vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-GFP) infection was controlled. Further evaluation of the other IFN-alpha/beta subtypes versus KFDV infection indicated that single treatments of either IFN-alpha WA and IFN-alpha kappa appeared to be more effective than IFN-alpha 2a at reducing KFDV titres. Concentration-dependent analysis of these IFN alpha/beta subtypes revealed that regardless of subtype, low concentrations of IFN were able to limit cytopathic effects (CPE), while significantly higher concentrations were needed for inhibition of virion release. Furthermore, expression of the KFDV NS5 in cell culture before IFN addition enabled VSV-GFP to overcome the effects of IFN-alpha/beta signalling, producing a robust infection.
   Conclusions/Significance
   Treatment of cell culture with IFN does not appear to be suitable for KFDV eradication and the assay used for such studies should be carefully considered. Further, it appears that the NS5 protein is sufficient to permit KFDV to bypass the antiviral properties of IFN. We suggest that other prophylactic therapeutics should be evaluated in place of IFN for treatment of individuals with KFDV disease.

TI  - Detection of <i>Bartonella</i> sp. in ticks and their small mammal hosts in mangrove forests of Peninsular Malaysia
T2  - TROPICAL BIOMEDICINE
AB  - Bacteria of the genus Bartonella have been known as emerging zoonotic pathogens for several human diseases including cat scratch disease, Carrion's disease and trench fever. Numerous species of small mammals have been reported to play a role as a suitable reservoir to many pathogenic. Bartonella. These infections are thought to be transmitted through blood-feeding arthropod vectors such as ticks, fleas and lice. The purpose of this study is to detect the presence of Bartonella species from tick samples collected from small mammals in mangrove forests of Peninsular Malaysia. Herein, 38 individual ticks and their small mammals host were evaluated for the presence of Bartonella DNA by conventional PCR targeting the 16S rRNA intergenic spacer region (ITS) and partial sequencing of 460 bp from this locususing Bartonella genus-specific primers. Two tick individuals from Dermacentor auratus and Haeraaphysalis hystricis collected from Rattus tiomanicus (host), were PCR-positive for Bartonella DNA amplification. No Bartonella amplification was possible in other tick species (Amblyomma sp.). Phylogenetic analysis of ITS fragments demonstrated that the sequences from ticks were closely related to Bartonella phoceensis, a species that has been reported from black rats (Rehm rattus) in Australia. This is the first report of a Bartonella bacteria detected in ticks from small mammals in Malaysia. Further research should be warranted to investigate the transmission of Bartonella and the potential impact of this zoonotic pathogen in animals and humans as this mangrove ecosystem is significant for local economy and tourism.

TI  - Dispersal and germination of seeds of <i>Pisonia grandis</i>, an Indo-Pacific tropical tree associated with insular seabird colonies
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY
AB  - The distribution of the forest tree Pisonia grandis (Nyctaginaceae) coincides with seabird colonies on small tropical islands. Its seeds are enclosed in a calyx exuding extremely sticky resin which adheres strongly to feathers. Birds are obviously seed-dispersal vectors, but the multi-seeded infructescences frequently entangle birds, often fatally. On Cousin Island, Seychelles, I investigated the production, germination, survival, and tolerance to seawater of Pisonia seeds. and the occurrence of entanglement with birds. Fresh seeds had high germination success (62-87%, in experimental trays), but seedling survival in Cousin's forests was low (0.1% of 6020 seeds survived as seedlings after 2-8 mo). Some seeds tolerated 30min daily immersions in seawater (8-15% germination after 14-28 d treatment), but not continuous immersion in seawater (reduced germination after 5 d and none after 12 d). Inter-island dispersal is likely via living unencumbered seabirds carrying a few seeds, but not on floating carcasses. Seeds attached to carcasses did not have improved germination or survival. Intra-island propagation is almost entirely vegetative, with negligible local seed dispersal. Pisonia plants therefore do not benefit from fatal entanglements. The extreme stickiness of the seeds evidently evolved to resist removal by seabirds and so facilitate long-distance dispersal. The mortality of some potential vectors is an unfortunate consequence, but has little impact on the large populations of tree- and ground-nesting seabirds which nest in or under these trees.

TI  - Mapping spatial variability of foliar nitrogen and carbon in Indian tropical moist deciduous sal (Shorea robusta) forest using machine learning algorithms and Sentinel-2 data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Foliar Nitrogen (N) and Carbon (C) are two vital leaf biochemical components that can indicate forest health. In this study, the spatial distribution of foliar N and C was mapped using Sentinel-2 data in a tropical moist deciduous sal (Shorea robusta) forest of northwest Himalayan foothills of India. Empirical relationships were established between satellite data-derived spectral indices, band reflectance and ground measured foliar N and C using machine learning algorithm (MLA). Performance of MLAs viz. Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were assessed. Using all the independent spectral variables, RF performed better than ANN and SVM in explaining the variation in foliar N and C. RF was further used to optimize the independent variables for identifying the best predictor variables. It was found that foliar N is strongly related to shortwave infrared-1 (SWIR-1) band and Normalized Difference Red Edge Index (NDRE). Foliar C was found to be strongly related to SWIR-1 band and spectral vegetation indices: Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI), Green Red Vegetation Index (GRVI), Green Chlorophyll Index (GCI), and Ratio of Modified Chlorophyll Absorption in Reflectance Index and Optimized Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (MCARI/OSAVI). Using these best predictor variables, the spatial variability of foliar N and C was mapped using RF algorithm. On validation of the predicted N and C with ground measured foliar N and C, R (2) of 0.85 (RMSE = 0.04%) for N and R (2) of 0.86 (RMSE = 0.26%) for C were observed. It can be concluded that MLAs have great potential to map the spatial variability of foliar N and C in the tropical forests using the broad bands of Sentinel-2 imagery.

TI  - Carbohydrate storage enhances seedling shade and stress tolerance in a neotropical forest
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
AB  - To survive in forest understoreys, seedlings must depend on carbohydrate reserves when they experience negative carbon balance imposed by occasional light reduction and tissue loss to herbivores and diseases. We present the first experimental evidence in support of this hypothesis, using seven woody neotropical species.
   We transplanted seedlings that had recently expanded their first photosynthetic cotyledon or leaf to the forest understorey (1% of full sun) and quantified initial biomass and total non-structural carbohydrate (TNC) in stems, roots and storage cotyledons. We then randomly assigned seedlings to control and two stress treatments: light reduction (0.08% of full sun for 8 weeks) and complete defoliation.
   First-year survival of control seedlings, a comparative measure of shade tolerance, differed widely among species. The two stress treatments reduced survival and relative growth rates (RGR) of all species. Shade-tolerant species were little impacted by the stress treatments, whereas the two least shade-tolerant species experienced 100% mortality.
   In all treatments, 8-week and first-year survival was positively correlated with initial TNC pool size in stems and roots. By contrast, survival was generally not correlated with initial TNC concentration in any organ, TNC pools in cotyledons, seed mass or seedling biomass.
   TNC in stems and roots, but not in cotyledons, decreased in response to light reduction and defoliation over 8 weeks. Leaf area recovery of defoliated seedlings was positively correlated with initial TNC pools in stems and roots.
   First-year survival in each treatment was negatively correlated with 0-8 week RGR of control seedlings, suggesting higher stress tolerance of species with inherently slow growth rates in shade. RGR of control seedlings from 0 to 8 weeks was negatively correlated with initial TNC pools, but not concentrations, in stems and roots. After 8 weeks, RGR was positive for all species, without clear relationships with survival or TNC.
   We conclude that carbohydrate storage in stems and roots enhances long-term survival in shade by enabling seedlings to cope with periods of biotic and abiotic stress. Carbohydrate storage is a key functional trait that can explain species differences in growth and survival that lead to species coexistence through niche assembly processes and life-history trade-offs.

TI  - Interventions to Reduce Risk for Pathogen Spillover and Early Disease Spread to Prevent Outbreaks, Epidemics, and Pandemics
T2  - EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB  - The pathogens that cause most emerging infectious diseases in humans originate in animals, particularly wildlife, and then spill over into humans. The accelerat-ing frequency with which humans and domestic animals encounter wildlife because of activities such as land-use change, animal husbandry, and markets and trade in live wildlife has created growing opportunities for patho-gen spillover. The risk of pathogen spillover and early disease spread among domestic animals and humans, however, can be reduced by stopping the clearing and degradation of tropical and subtropical forests, improv-ing health and economic security of communities liv-ing in emerging infectious disease hotspots, enhancing biosecurity in animal husbandry, shutting down or strictly regulating wildlife markets and trade, and expanding pathogen surveillance. We summarize expert opinions on how to implement these goals to prevent outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemics.

TI  - Stem and foliar blight in roselle (<i>Hibiscus sabdariffa</i> L. var. <i>sabdariffa</i>) in the tropical forest region of south-western Nigeria
T2  - JOURNAL OF HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE & BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB  - The aetiology and epidemiology of leaf and stem blights of roselle (Hibiscus sabdariffa L. var. sabdariffa) was investigated at Ibadan, in the tropical forest region of south-west Nigeria. Out of 250 diseased plants examined, 63% had symptoms of leaf blight, 46% stem blight and 42% had both. Leaf blight symptoms were associated with infection by Phyllosticta hibiscini and stem blight with Fusarium oxysporum. Infection in the field by these fungi occurs during the peak of the rainy season, beginning in patches which later spread, causing extensive blight, defoliation and complete wilting. Populations of 4.6 +/- 0.5 x 10(6) g(-1) and 4.3 +/- 0.4 x 106 g(-1) colony forming units/g were found in soil for P. hibiscini and F. oxysporum respectively, while plant debris also harboured both pathogens.

TI  - Influenza A in Shorebirds in the Tropical Landscape of Guatemala
T2  - WATERBIRDS
AB  - Information on Influenza A virus (IAV) prevalence in shorebird populations in Guatemala is scarce, and no live captures of shorebirds have been made for this purpose. The only reported case of Influenza A in shorebirds in Guatemala corresponded to a harvested individual. To update and obtain information of IAV in shorebirds, a transversal study was made on the South Coast of Guatemala. The main objective of this study was to evaluate presence of Influenza A among migratory shorebirds in stopover areas in the country. Captures and sampling took place in three sites during migration (October-April) over three migratory periods (2016-2017, 2017-2018, and 2018-2019). In total, 127 shorebirds belonging to 14 species of genera Calidris, Charadrius, Tringa, and Actitis were captured using mist nets. Tracheal and cloacal swabs were collected from each bird using a cotton swab, then tested with RT-PCR techniques targeting Influenza A. Blood samples were taken from the jugular or basilic vein to obtain serum that later was tested using a commercial ELISA Kit for detection of antibodies against Influenza A. Birds were released after sampling. All samples were PCR negative (0/127).One sandpiper specimen (Calidris minutilla) tested sero-positive to Influenza A through the ELISA test (1/122). These results suggest that IAV infection in this region may be minimal, as other studies have reported; nevertheless, it is important to consider that sample size was small in this study, and that the species included may not be the best indicators.

TI  - Simulating Population Genetics of Pathogen Vectors in Changing Landscapes: Guidelines and Application with <i>Triatoma brasiliensis</i>
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background: Understanding the mechanisms that influence the population dynamics and spatial genetic structure of the vectors of pathogens infecting humans is a central issue in tropical epidemiology. In view of the rapid changes in the features of landscape pathogen vectors live in, this issue requires new methods that consider both natural and human systems and their interactions. In this context, individual-based model (IBM) simulations represent powerful yet poorly developed approaches to explore the response of pathogen vectors in heterogeneous social-ecological systems, especially when field experiments cannot be performed.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We first present guidelines for the use of a spatially explicit IBM, to simulate population genetics of pathogen vectors in changing landscapes. We then applied our model with Triatoma brasiliensis, originally restricted to sylvatic habitats and now found in peridomestic and domestic habitats, posing as the most important Trypanosoma cruzi vector in Northeastern Brazil. We focused on the effects of vector migration rate, maximum dispersal distance and attraction by domestic habitat on T. brasiliensis population dynamics and spatial genetic structure. Optimized for T. brasiliensis using field data pairwise fixation index (FST) from microsatellite loci, our simulations confirmed the importance of these three variables to understand vector genetic structure at the landscape level. We then ran prospective scenarios accounting for land-use change (deforestation and urbanization), which revealed that human-induced land-use change favored higher genetic diversity among sampling points.
   Conclusions/Significance: Our work shows that mechanistic models may be useful tools to link observed patterns with processes involved in the population genetics of tropical pathogen vectors in heterogeneous social-ecological landscapes. Our hope is that our study may provide a testable and applicable modeling framework to a broad community of epidemiologists for formulating scenarios of landscape change consequences on vector dynamics, with potential implications for their surveillance and control.

TI  - Food web structure and microenvironment affect Chagas disease vector infection and abundance in a rural landscape
T2  - ECOSPHERE
AB  - Vector-borne pathogen transmission is shaped by multiple abiotic and biotic factors. Understanding the relative importance of these factors on vector abundance and infection is important for developing vector-borne disease control strategies. The crown of the Attalea butyracea palm provides a natural arboreal mesocosm suitable for studying how food web relations and microclimate affect Chagas disease vectors of the genus Rhodnius, which feed on vertebrate blood and interact with many vertebrate and invertebrate species, vegetation, and detritus within the palm crown. We performed a cross-sectional, observational study of A. butyracea crowns using a community ecology network approach to evaluate abiotic and biotic conditions associated with Rhodnius pallescens abundance and infection with Trypanosoma cruzi, the Chagas disease etiologic agent. We collected 1098 R. pallescens from 105 A. butyracea crowns in rural landscapes of Panama. In a palm subset (N = 49), we recorded microclimate and habitat conditions and counted vertebrate and invertebrate species in order to characterize palm crown food webs. We used food web metrics, namely Generality (average number of prey per predator) and Vulnerability (average number of predators per prey) to evaluate associations between palm community trophic structure, vector predators, vector blood meal species composition, vector abundance, and vector T. cruzi infection. Field data analyzed with generalized linear models showed that vector abundance and infection in a given palm crown were influenced by a combination of geographic location, land-use type, palm crown animal community composition, and microhabitat conditions. Vector abundance was negatively associated with increased overall palm crown community diversity. However, vector abundance was positively associated with the invertebrate predator and mammal community. R. pallescens Vulnerability score, which measures predation pressure on the vector within the palm crown, was positively associated with vector abundance. Vector infection with T. cruzi was positively associated with mammal presence; vectors in palms with mammals were about 25 times more likely to be infected with T. cruzi compared with vectors in palms without mammals. Our findings suggest that a holistic study of food webs and environmental variables at the local scale can provide useful information for vector-borne disease management across a wide habitat range.

TI  - Long-distance dispersal helps germinating mahogany seedlings escape defoliation by a specialist caterpillar
T2  - OECOLOGIA
AB  - Herbivores and pathogens with acute host specificity may promote high tree diversity in tropical forests by causing distance- and density-dependent mortality of seedlings, but evidence is scarce. Although Lepidoptera larvae are the most abundant and host-specific guild of herbivores in these forests, their impact upon seedling distributions remains largely unknown. A firm test of the mechanism underpinning the Janzen-Connell hypothesis is difficult, even for a single tree species, because it requires more than just manipulating seeds and seedlings and recording their fates. Experimental tests require: (1) an insect herbivore that is identified and highly specialised, (2) linkage to an in situ measure (or prevention) of herbivory, and (3) evaluation and confirmation among many conspecific adult trees across years. Here we present experimental evidence for a spatially explicit interaction between newly germinating seedlings of a Neotropical emergent tree, big-leaf mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla, Meliaceae), and caterpillars of a noctuid moth (Steniscadia poliophaea). In the understory of a southeastern Amazon forest, the proportion of attacks, leaf area lost, and seedling mortality due to this specialised herbivore peaked near Swietenia trees, but declined significantly with increasing distance from mature fruiting trees, as predicted by the Janzen-Connell hypothesis. We conclude that long-distance dispersal events (> 50 m) provided an early survival advantage for Swietenia seedlings, and propose that the role of larval Lepidoptera as Janzen-Connell vectors may be underappreciated in tropical forests.

TI  - Yam: ecology, cropping systems and food uses in tropical Africa. A literature review
T2  - CAHIERS AGRICULTURES
AB  - This paper presents a literature review about botany, ecology, cropping systems, processing, constraints and prospects of sustainable yam production in tropical regions of Africa. Yam is a taxon of mainly tropical species requiring high temperatures. Germination is optimal between 25 and 30 degrees C, whereas temperatures below 15 degrees C or above 35 degrees C delay it. Yam is successfully cultivated in areas with rainfall ranging from 1000 to 1800 mm; however, it is possible to cultivate yam with a rainfall of only 600 mm, but yield remains low. To reach vegetative growth and good tuber formation, yam prefers sandy-loamy or loamy soils, with hydraulic conductivity of 15 cm/h, apparent soil density between 1.1 and 1.6 g.cm(-3) and light and deep soils (> 0.6 m), well drained, rich in organic matter, nitrogen, potash, magnesium and calcium. A soil pH from 5 to 7 is suitable for a good yam production. Beyond the edaphic and climatic factors, cultivation practices, including cultivar, plantation density, date of planting, management of weeds, diseases and pests, cropping history of plots and farmers' soil management practices, affect yam productivity. Farmers base the choice of yam varieties mainly on culinary quality of tubers, productivity, commercial value, propagation, quality of chips, tuber formation precocity, conservation, facility of culture, roles as food and for ritual ceremonies.

TI  - Evaluation and Calibration of Remotely Sensed High Winds from the HY-2B/C/D Scatterometer in Tropical Cyclones
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Haiyang-2 scatterometers (HY-2A/B/C/D) have limitations in high wind speed retrieval due to the complexity of the remote sensing mechanism and the influence of rainfall on the radar cross section under the conditions of tropical cyclones. In this study, we focus on the evaluation of Chinese scatterometer operational wind products from HY-2B/C/D over the period from July 2019 to December 2021. HY-2B/C/D scatterometer wind products are collocated with SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive) L-band radiometer remotely sensed measurements. The results show that the underestimation of high wind speed occurs in the HY-2B/C/D wind speed products. The machine learning algorithms are explored to improve this underestimation issue, including the back propagation neural network (BP-NN), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), and Bayesian ridge (BR) regression algorithms. Comparisons show that the BP-NN algorithm shows the best performance with a small RMSE (root-mean-square error) of 3.40 m/s, and high correlation coefficient of 0.88, demonstrating an improvement of 20.4% in RMSE (root-mean-square error) compared with the HY-2B/C/D wind speed products. In addition, the revised high winds are in good agreement with the ground truth measurements from the SFMR (Stepped Frequency Microwave Radiometer), which are useful for tropical cyclone disaster prevention and mitigation and are of vital importance in the numerical simulation of storm surges.

TI  - Wetlands, climate zones and Barmah Forest virus disease in Queensland, Australia
T2  - TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Barmah Forest virus (BFV) disease is the second most common mosquito-borne disease in Australia, but the linkages of the wetlands and climate zones with BFV transmission remain unclear. We aimed to examine the relationship between the wetlands, climate zones and BFV risk in Queensland, Australia. Data on the wetlands, climate zones, population and BFV cases for the period 1992 to 2008 were obtained from relevant government agencies. BFV risk was grouped as low-, medium- and high-level based on BFV incidence percentiles. The buffer zones around each BFV case were made using 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 50 km distances. We performed a discriminant analysis to determine the differences between wetland classes and BFV risk within each climate zone. The discriminant analyses show that saline 1, riverine and saline tidal influence were the most significant contributors to BFV risk in all climate and buffer zones, while lacustrine, palustrine, estuarine and saline 2 and saline 3 wetlands were less important. These models had classification accuracies of 76%, 98% and 100% for BFV risk in subtropical, tropical and temperate climate zones, respectively. This study demonstrates that BFV risk varies with wetland class and climate zone. The discriminant analysis is a useful tool to quantify the links between wetlands, climate zones and BFV risk.

TI  - Detection of Zika Virus in <i>Aedes aegypti</i> and <i>Aedes albopictus</i> Mosquitoes Collected in Urban Forest Fragments in the Brazilian Amazon
T2  - VIRUSES-BASEL
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is an RNA flavivirus (Flaviviridae family) endemic in tropical and subtropical regions that is transmitted to humans by Aedes (Stegomyia) species mosquitoes. The two main urban vectors of ZIKV are Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, which can be found throughout Brazil. This study investigated ZIKV infection in mosquito species sampled from urban forest fragments in Manaus (Brazilian Amazon). A total of 905 non-engorged female Ae. aegypti (22 specimens) and Ae. albopictus (883 specimens) were collected using BG-Sentinel traps, entomological hand nets, and Prokopack aspirators during the rainy and dry seasons between 2018 and 2021. All pools were macerated and used to inoculate C6/36 culture cells. Overall, 3/20 (15%) Ae. aegypti and 5/241 (2%) Ae. albopictus pools screened using RT-qPCR were positive for ZIKV. No supernatants from Ae. aegypti were positive for ZIKV (0%), and 15 out of 241 (6.2%) Ae. albopictus pools were positive. In this study, we provide the first-ever evidence of Ae. albopictus naturally infected with ZIKV in the Amazon region.

T2  - FOOD SAFETY ASSURANCE IN THE PRE-HARVEST PHASE, VOL 1: FOOD SAFETY ASSURANCE AND VETERINARY PUBLIC HEALTH
CP  - Conference on Food Safety in the Pre-Harvest Phase
AB  - A number of communicable diseases is transmitted from animals to humans - known as zoonoses. These diseases transmitted either by animal products like foodstuff or direct contact can cause substantial health problems and severe economic toss in developing and in industrialized countries. Various zoonotic pathogens are considered to be emerging or re-emerging. Examples for emerging pathogens are Yersinia enterocolitica, Salmonella enteritidis, Escherichia coli O157:H7. "Classical" zoonotic diseases such as anthrax, brucellosis, leptospirosis, rabies, or bovine tuberculosis have been controlled or eliminated in many industrialized countries, but remain still endemic in developing regions. New zoonotic agents such as the Nipah virus (Malaysia, 1999), the "bird flu" influenza virus A (H5N1) (Hong Kong, 1997) and with special respect to Europe prions causing bovine spongiform encephalopathy (United Kingdom, 1985) can be recognized. Further threats to human health are animal-associated opportunistic parasites or bacteria (e.g. Toxoplasma gondii, Listeria monocytogenes) when they infect immunocompromised patients e.g. HIV positive patients.
   The upward trend in the number of zoonotic diseases can be traced to environmental, technical, medical, agricultural and industrial changes. The WHO fact sheets list many reasons: the alteration of the environment affecting the size and distribution of animal species and vectors, an increasing human intrusion into previously un-populated areas (e.g. tropical forests) favouring the first contact of people and 'new' agents; the deterioration of public health and veterinary infrastructures particularly in developing regions (e.g. illegal slaughtering of animals and inappropriate waste disposal practices); misuse of antibiotics and antimicrobial drugs in humans and animals, which can hasten the evolution of resistant microbes; deforestation, changes in climate and weather; the continuing evolution of pathogenic microorganisms; new medical techniques like xenotransplantation; industrialization and intensification of the animal production (crowding); changes in food processing, food distribution and the nutritional habits of consumers (consumption of 'raw' animal products such as non-pasteurized milk); increase of international movement of people and of international trade of animals and animal products and finally the increased numbers of immunocompromised persons. Water, air, soil, feed - contaminated by animal waste -, inadequate waste management practices, uncontrolled animal-to-animal contact or contact to wildlife play an important rote in the epidemiology of zoonotic diseases at the pre-harvest Level. The food-processing industry can also have a significant influence on the epidemiology of zoonotic diseases. Effluents which contaminate the environment may originate from slaughterhouses e.g. from sewage contaminated with faeces. Carcasses may serve as carriers for infectious agents to the food-processing plants where they eventually contaminate the processed food. Rodents and pests may also be vectors.
   Hygienic animal keeping guarantees that the spread of pathogens in the animal population of a farm, to other farms, to food-processing plants and to the consumer can be minimised. Hence, an effective surveillance and control of zoonoses is required aided by strict control strategies and legislation.

TI  - Modeling of tropical cyclone activity over the North Indian Ocean using generalised additive model and machine learning techniques: role of Boreal summer intraseasonal oscillation
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
AB  - This study investigates the contribution of Boreal Summer Intraseasonal Oscillation (BSISO) to the tropical cyclone (TC) activity over the North Indian Ocean (NIO) and assesses the prediction skill of a statistical Generalised Additive Model (GAM) and two machine learning techniques-Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Regression (SVR). Joint Typhoon Warning Centre TC and BSISO1 Index data have been used for a period of 33-year (1981-2013). By considering eight phases of BSISO, prediction models have been developed using a kernel density estimation for the TC genesis, Euler integration step to fit the tracks, and a country mask approach for the landfall across the NIO rim countries. Result shows that GAM has the highest prediction skill compared to the RF and SVR. Westward and Northward moving TCs are controlled by the wind and the TC activities during BSISO phases which modulated by wind matched well against observations over the NIO. Distance calculation validation method is applied to assess the skill of models.

TI  - Trypanosoma cruzi reservoir-triatomine vector co-occurrence networks reveal meta-community effects by synanthropic mammals on geographic dispersal
T2  - PEERJ
AB  - Contemporary patterns of land use and global climate change are modifying regional pools of parasite host species. The impact of host community changes on human disease risk, however, is difficult to assess due to a lack of information about zoonotic parasite host assemblages. We have used a recently developed method to infer parasite-host interactions for Chagas Disease (CD) from vector-host co-occurrence networks. Vector-host networks were constructed to analyze topological characteristics of the network and ecological traits of species' nodes, which could provide information regarding parasite regional dispersal in Mexico. Twenty-eight triatomine species (vectors) and 396 mammal species (potential hosts) were included using a data-mining approach to develop models to infer most-likely interactions. The final network contained 1,576 links which were analyzed to calculate centrality, connectivity, and modularity. The model predicted links of independently registered Trypanosoma cruzi hosts, which correlated with the degree of parasite-vector co-occurrence. Wiring patterns differed according to node location, while edge density was greater in Neotropical as compared to Nearctic regions. Vectors with greatest public health importance (i.e., Triatoma dimidiata, T. barberi, T. pallidipennis, T. longipennis, etc), did not have stronger links with particular host species, although they had a greater frequency of significant links. In contrast, hosts classified as important based on network properties were synanthropic mammals. The latter were the most common parasite hosts and are likely bridge species between these communities, thereby integrating meta-community scenarios beneficial for long-range parasite dispersal. This was particularly true for rodents, >50% of species are synanthropic and more than 20% have been identified as T. cruzi hosts. In addition to predicting potential host species using the co-occurrence networks, they reveal regions with greater expected parasite mobility. The Neotropical region, which includes the Mexican south and southeast, and the Transvolcanic belt, had greatest potential active T. cruzi dispersal, as well as greatest edge density. This information could be directly applied for stratification of transmission risk and to design and analyze human-infected vector contact intervention efficacy.

TI  - An expanding tropical pathology: Buruli ulcer
T2  - ANTIBIOTIQUES
AB  - Buruli ulcer is due to Mycobacterium ulcerans, described in 1948 in Australia. It is an important health problem in 30 countries, mostly in tropical areas in a humid and hot climate (West Africa, Asia, Papua New Guinea, Australia). There is an increasing prevalence due to the deforestation and the ecological alterations. Children under fifteen years of age have a higher risk. In 80% of cases, lesions are in the limbs. M. ulcerans was found in aquatic insects. The mode of transmission of infection remains uncertain (mild traumatic injuries). Lesions in the skin are nodules, cutaneous ulcers, oedema, which evoluate to extensive ulcers, with necrosis and severe deformity. Diagnosis must be done with cutaneous leishmaniasis, tropical phagedenic ulcer, noma or mycosis. Diagnosis is based on ulcer swabs or biopsies and a culture in Loewenstein medium at 30 degrees C. Antibiotic therapy (rifampicin streptomycin) and surgical excision are useful to the recovery. Regular use of soap for washing and treating injuries appeared protective against M. ulcerans. BCG vaccination has a mild protective effect. (C) 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

TI  - Huge diversity of phleboviruses in ticks from Strandja Nature Park, Bulgaria
T2  - TICKS AND TICK-BORNE DISEASES
AB  - The discovery of the first tick-borne phleboviruses associated with severe disease in humans stimulated studies searching for further previously unknown tick-associated viruses. Novel phleboviruses have subsequently been identified in ticks from the USA, Japan and China and recently also from Europe. Here, we investigated the genetic diversity of tick-borne phleboviruses originating from Strandja Nature Park, Bulgaria, a unique primary forest with evergreen plants that was not affected by the last ice ages in the Pleistocene and Holocene.
   We found a high genetic diversity of 12 phleboviral sequences in 1542 ticks. The sequences formed five distinct groups and clustered with other tick-borne phleboviruses recently identified in Europe. Although isolation experiments of the detected viruses in cell culture failed, viral RNA copy numbers were stable up to 42 days post infection (dpi) in the supernatant of tick cells whereas they disappeared 14 dpi in that of VeroE6/7 cells. In summary, nearly all tick-associated phleboviruses known to occur in Europe have been detected in one geographic region. Our data show that primary ecosystems in temperate regions are also rich in viral diversity and that this is not only true for tropical regions.

TI  - Physical Attributes of Tree Holes in the Atlantic Forest Edges: Evaluating Their Association with the Presence and Abundance of Immature <i>Haemagogus leucocelaenus</i>
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE
AB  - Sylvatic yellow fever (SYF) was recently a health issue in Brazil (2016-2019) because transmission was facilitated by a high density of vectors, amplifying hosts, and low vaccine coverage of the human population, especially in urban forests in the Southeast Region of Brazil. Moreover, urban forest edges are more likely to have contact between human and sylvatic vector mosquito populations. Here, we show the association between abiotic and biotic features of tree holes as Haemagogus leucocelaenus rearing sites in Cantareira State Park in Atlantic Forest edges. The analyzed physical features of the tree holes were diameter at breast height, tree hole opening diameter, depth, trunk diameter, tree hole volume, collected volume, height (varying from 0.02 to 4.2 m above ground), and the presence of Culicidae species other than Hg. leucocelaenus. We analyzed 105 positive and 68 negative water samples for larval presence and found no differences between them, suggesting the lack of specific physical characteristics in these categories. Hg. leucocelaenus larval abundance was correlated with the collected volume and opening diameter of tree holes. The tree species that most represented negative breeding sites were Euplassa cantareirae, Guarea macrophylla, Psychotria suterella, and Tibouchina pulchra. Four significant clusters as areas with a high risk of SYV were identified by Get-Ordis spatial analysis. Although Hg. leucocelaenus larvae were found in tree holes with high water levels, their occurrence was regulated by that of other mosquito species. Our findings contribute to clarifying immature vector ecology in tree holes related to human exposure to SYF in urban forest edges.

TI  - Molecular Epidemiology of Cross-Species <i>Giardia duodenalis</i> Transmission in Western Uganda
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background: Giardia duodenalis is prevalent in tropical settings where diverse opportunities exist for transmission between people and animals. We conducted a cross-sectional study of G. duodenalis in people, livestock, and wild primates near Kibale National Park, Uganda, where human-livestock-wildlife interaction is high due to habitat disturbance. Our goal was to infer the cross-species transmission potential of G. duodenalis using molecular methods and to investigate clinical consequences of infection.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Real-time PCR on DNA extracted from fecal samples revealed a combined prevalence of G. duodenalis in people from three villages of 44/108 (40.7%), with prevalence reaching 67.5% in one village. Prevalence rates in livestock and primates were 12.4% and 11.1%, respectively. Age was associated with G. duodenalis infection in people (higher prevalence in individuals <= 15 years) and livestock (higher prevalence in subadult versus adult animals), but other potential risk factors in people (gender, contact with domestic animals, working in fields, working in forests, source of drinking water, and medication use) were not. G. duodenalis infection was not associated with gastrointestinal symptoms in people, nor was clinical disease noted in livestock or primates. Sequence analysis of four G. duodenalis genes identified assemblage AII in humans, assemblage BIV in humans and endangered red colobus monkeys, and assemblage E in livestock and red colobus, representing the first documentation of assemblage E in a non-human primate. In addition, genetic relationships within the BIV assemblage revealed sub-clades of identical G. duodenalis sequences from humans and red colobus.
   Conclusions/Significance: Our finding of G. duodenalis in people and primates (assemblage BIV) and livestock and primates (assemblage E) underscores that cross-species transmission of multiple G. duodenalis assemblages may occur in locations such as western Uganda where people, livestock, and primates overlap in their use of habitat. Our data also demonstrate a high but locally variable prevalence of G. duodenalis in people from western Uganda, but little evidence of associated clinical disease. Reverse zoonotic G. duodenalis transmission may be particularly frequent in tropical settings where anthropogenic habitat disturbance forces people and livestock to interact at high rates with wildlife, and this could have negative consequences for wildlife conservation.

TI  - The rise of neglected tropical diseases in the "new Texas"
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Within the last five years, the State of Texas has experienced either transmission or outbreaks of Ebola, chikungunya, West Nile, and Zika virus infections. Autochthonous transmission of neglected parasitic and bacterial diseases has also become increasingly reported. The rise of such emerging and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) has not occurred by accident but instead reflects rapidly evolving changes and shifts in a "new" Texas beset by modern and globalizing forces that include rapid expansions in population together with urbanization and human migrations, altered transportation patterns, climate change, steeply declining vaccination rates, and a new paradigm of poverty known as "blue marble health." Summarized here are the major NTDs now affecting Texas. In addition to the vector-borne viral diseases highlighted above, there also is a high level of parasitic infections, including Chagas disease, trichomoniasis, and possibly leishmaniasis and toxocariasis, as well as typhus-group rickettsiosis, a vector-borne bacterial infection. I also highlight some of the key shifts in emerging and neglected disease patterns, partly due to an altered and evolving economic and ecological landscape in the new Texas, and provide some preliminary disease burden estimates for the major prevalent and incident NTDs.

TI  - Model Classification of Fire Weather Index using the SVM-FF Method on Forest Fire in North Sumatra, Indonesia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
AB  - As a tropical country, Indonesia is situated in Southeast Asia nation has vast forests. Forest fire occur busy vary due to land conditions and forest conditions in drought season. The indicator used mitigated potential forest fire is to study the indicator behavior of the fire weather index (FWI). The data is gathered from the observation station in north Sumatra province, computation and estimation FWI by Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index based on the data gathered. It is found that there is gathered outlier data. to hope will it, it is necessary to conduct classification and predict this of the dataset by machine learning approach using Support Vector Machine Forest Fire (SVM-FF), which is a further development of the previous models, known as the c-SVM and v-SVM. This method includes a balancing parameter by determining the lower and upper limits of a support vector. Furthermore, it allowed the balancing parameter value to be negative. The results showed that the classification of FWI was at low, medium, high, and extreme levels. The low FWI value has an average of 0.5 which is in the 0 to 1 interval. There was an increase in the model's accuracy and performance from its predecessor, which include the c-SVM and v-SVM with respective values of 0.96 and 0.89. Meanwhile, it was observed that with the SVM-FF model, the accuracy was quite better with a value of 0.99, indicating that it is useful as an alternative to classify and predict forest fires.

TI  - Spatio-temporal variation of biting flies, <i>Stomoxys</i> spp. (Diptera: Muscidae), along a man-made disturbance gradient, from primary forest to the city of Makokou (North-East, Gabon)
T2  - MEDICAL AND VETERINARY ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - Understanding the pattern of abundance of vector populations is important to control the potential of transmission of associated pathogens. The pattern of abundance of Stomoxys Geoffroy, an ubiquitous blood-sucking fly, is poorly known in tropical Africa. In this study, we investigated the spatio-temporal pattern of abundance of the Stomoxys genus along a gradient of man-made disturbance in north-eastern Gabon. Three sites (one in primary forest, one in secondary forest and one in a man-made environment) were monitored during 13 months using Vavoua traps. Seven species and subspecies were found to live in sympatry, but with distinct patterns of abundance with respect to space and time. The most abundant species was Stomoxys transvittatus Villeneuve, whereas the rarest species was S. xanthomelas Roubaud. Stomoxys calcitrans Linne was preferentially found in man-made environments, whereas S. xanthomelas was preferentially found in primary forest. Stomoxys abundance was the greatest in secondary forest, then in man-made environments and finally in primary forest. A seasonal variation in Stomoxys abundance was also found. In conclusion, forest degradation and deforestation are likely both to favour the concentration of populations of Stomoxys, and to change the specific composition of the Stomoxys community.

TI  - Habitat fragmentation is associated with dietary shifts and microbiota variability in common vampire bats
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB  - Host ecological factors and external environmental factors are known to influence the structure of gut microbial communities, but few studies have examined the impacts of environmental changes on microbiotas in free-ranging animals. Rapid land-use change has the potential to shift gut microbial communities in wildlife through exposure to novel bacteria and/or by changing the availability or quality of local food resources. The consequences of such changes to host health and fitness remain unknown and may have important implications for pathogen spillover between humans and wildlife. To better understand the consequences of land-use change on wildlife microbiotas, we analyzed long-term dietary trends, gut microbiota composition, and innate immune function in common vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) in two nearby sites in Belize that vary in landscape structure. We found that vampire bats living in a small forest fragment had more homogenous diets indicative of feeding on livestock and shifts in microbiota heterogeneity, but not overall composition, compared to those living in an intact forest reserve. We also found that irrespective of sampling site, vampire bats which consumed relatively more livestock showed shifts in some core bacteria compared with vampire bats which consumed relatively less livestock. The relative abundance of some core microbiota members was associated with innate immune function, suggesting that future research should consider the role of the host microbiota in immune defense and its relationship to zoonotic infection dynamics. We suggest that subsequent homogenization of diet and habitat loss through livestock rearing in the Neotropics may lead to disruption to the microbiota that could have downstream impacts on host immunity and cross-species pathogen transmission.

TI  - Fungal disease cluster in tropical terrestrial frogs predicted by low rainfall
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Anthropogenic forces are increasing climate anomalies and disease pressure in tropical forests. Terrestrialbreeding amphibians, a diverse group of highly endemic tropical frogs, have been experiencing cryptic population declines and extinctions, most of which have been retrospectively linked to climate anomalies and the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). However, the spatiotemporal drivers of Bd infection in these species are unresolved. We tracked microhabitat conditions and Bd dynamics in terrestrial-breeding frogs in Brazil's Atlantic Forest over an annual cycle that coincided with a period of low rainfall compared to historical averages. An increase in Bd prevalence during the warm/wet season was attributable to pathogen spillover from co-occurring aquatic-breeding frogs. The deficit in rainfall compared to historical trends was the best predictor of spikes in Bd infection loads one month later and mortality among heavily infected frogs two months later. We suggest that hydrological stress may intensify seasonal pathogen amplification in direct-developing frogs, to an extent that may trigger localized disease clusters or potentially shift disease dynamics from enzootic to epizootic, even in areas with a relatively long history of host-pathogen coexistence.

TI  - Effect of land use change on the phlebotomine sand fly assemblages in an emergent focus of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Yucatan, Mexico
T2  - ACTA TROPICA
AB  - As land use intensifies in tropical forests, it is expected that species assemblages will be modified and that key functions of these ecosystems will be affected. The latter scenario is important from a public health perspective, because the land use change has been linked the outbreaks of vector-borne diseases. In this study, we evaluated the response of Phlebotominae (Diptera: Psychodidae) assemblages and their pattern of co-occurrence in four sites with different land use in an emerging cutaneous leishmaniasis focus in Yucatan, Mexico. Our hypothesis is that the conservation status (as forest cover) will positively influence the structure and composition of sand flies' assemblages. Using three different traps over a period of five months, a sampling effort of 1, 440 night-traps was performed. A total of 7, 897 sand fly specimens belonging to six genera and 10 species were collected. Our hypothesis was partially achieved since sand fly diversity increased as forest cover increased and vice versa, however random patterns of co-occurrence in assemblages were detected among sites. Even though the high abundance of sand flies in the forest fragment suggests an amplification effect, our results show that different vector species directly dominate in each site. We discuss the potential implications of the nestedness of species dominance. We suggest that in this emerging focus and under the land use gradient, Lutzomyia cruciata and Psathyromyia cratifer could play a pivotal role in maintaining the transmission cycles of Leishmania. The apparent generalist or colonialist profile of Lu. cruciata in disturbed areas deserves attention, due to the potential risk of leishmaniasis "domiciliation". This information is essential to understand the eco-epidemiology of leishmaniasis and the factors associated with its emergence in Yucatan, Mexico.

TI  - Temporal Variation in Infection Prevalence by the Amphibian Chytrid Fungus in Three Species of Frogs at La Selva, Costa Rica
T2  - BIOTROPICA
AB  - The emerging infectious disease chytridiomycosis, caused by the amphibian chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), is implicated in widespread population declines, extirpations, and extinctions of amphibians throughout the world. In the Neotropics, most amphibian declines have occurred in cool mid- to high-elevation sites (> 400 m asl), and it is hypothesized that high temperatures limit the growth of Bd in lowland tropical sites, despite few data available on the distribution of Bd in lowland forests. Here, we report the results of a 12-mo pathogen surveillance program for three common species of frogs at a warm lowland site in northeastern Costa Rica. We combine standard non-invasive skin swabbing techniques with a quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay to analyze the infection prevalence and Bd load across a 1-yr period. Our data indicate an overall Bd infection rate of 6.1 percent, but prevalence varies from < 5 percent in warmer months to a peak of 34.7 percent in the coolest months of the year. Despite very little seasonal variation in temperature (< 4 degrees C), our data indicate strong seasonal variation in the prevalence of Bd, with highest prevalence of infection in months with coolest air temperatures. While it has been suggested that Bd is primarily a riparian fungus, we find no difference in prevalence of infection among our species despite considerable differences in affiliation of these species with water. Our study provides further evidence that infection by Bd is regulated by temperature and shows that warm temperatures in lowland forests may restrict, but not prevent, infection by Bd.

TI  - Physiological ecology of natural regeneration of harvested and disturbed forest stands: implications for forest management
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Forests are indispensable as sources of harvested products and a variety of services. Unfortunately forests throughout the world, and especially in the tropics, are threatened by natural and human-induced disturbances. Regeneration of harvested or otherwise severely disturbed forest stands typically occurs in four stages: (1) stand initiation and regeneration stage, (2) thinning or stem exclusion stage, (3) transition or understory regeneration stage, and (4) steady-state or old-growth stage. Blocks to stand regeneration may occur in each of these stages. Revegetation of severely-disturbed forests often is very slow and unpredictable because of complex interactions among propagules as well as site and climatic conditions. Stand regeneration depends on an abundant and viable seed supply, a suitable medium for seed germination, favorable environmental conditions, and capacity for sprouting or layering of some species. Massive losses of seeds in seed banks occur because of seed aging, failure of seed germination, predation, diseases, and death of seeds. Mortality of seedlings also is high, especially in the cotyledon stage of development, because of low reserves of carbohydrates and mineral nutrients. Growth of older seedlings, saplings, and mature trees is inhibited by air and soil pollution, drought, flooding, soil compaction, insect attacks, and diseases. After canopy closure occurs in a developing forest stand changes in species composition are traceable to competition among plants for light, water, and mineral nutrients. Following severe disturbance of a multi-aged, mixed forest, a mixed-species stand of fast growing, generally short-lived trees typically occupies a site and is succeeded by species that dominated the stand before the disturbance occurred. After a minor disturbance gaps form in the canopy and are recolonized. If plant succession in a developing stand runs its full course the resulting old-growth forest is impacted by frequent minor disturbances and is maintained in an oscillating steady-state in which stand establishment, thinning, gap formation, and colonization recur. In some regions frequent fires maintain forest stands in a subclimax stage of development. Natural regeneration of harvested or otherwise severely disturbed stands likely will be too slow and unpredictable to provide all the forest products and services required by increasing population growth. Hence, greater emphasis on several concurrent strategies will be needed, including heavy emphasis on artificial regeneration of disturbed forests; conservation of the remaining tropical forests; expansion of plantations, agroforestry systems, and forest reserves; expansion of tree improvement programs; more intensive and improved forest management; and expanded research with particular emphasis on seed biology, responses of tree species and genotypes to environmental stresses, tradeoffs between beneficial and harmful effects of environmental stresses on tree species and genotypes, genetic engineering, potential effects of global warming on forests, agroforestry systems, models of stand productivity; and appraisal by remote sensing of injury to forest ecosystems.

TI  - Dispersal vacuum in the seedling recruitment of a primate-dispersed Amazonian tree
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Unregulated hunting of large-bodied frugivores is ubiquitous in tropical forests. Due to their low fecundity and complex social organization, large primates are often the first tropical forest vertebrates to be extirpated by hunting. Large primates are important seed dispersers and the only dispersal vectors of many large-seeded plants, leading to concerns that primate-dispersed trees will succumb to large-scale recruitment failure wherever they co-occur with overhunting. We used a field experiment in a remote, nonhunted region of the western Brazilian Amazon to test how the seedling recruitment success of a primate-dispersed Sapotaceae tree (Manilkara bidentata) is affected by distance from parent trees, protection from vertebrate seed predators, and gastro-intestinal seed cleaning associated with passage through frugivorous vertebrates. Only seed cleaning significantly increased the rate of seedling recruitment. Janzen-Connell effects have been widely purported as the central mechanism for recruitment failure, but our results suggest that for many tropical forest plant species Janzen-Connell effects are a second-order effect that acts once seeds have been successfully cleaned of fruit pulp by gut treatment. As an illustration of the relative importance of the sheer quantity of seeds ingested by woolly monkeys (Lagothrix cana), we further estimate the density and dispersal services provided by a complete primate assemblage to show that L cana cleans and disperses nearly one million seeds per km(2) per 24-day Manilkara fruiting season, amounting to over 71% of the seed dispersal services provided by the entire primate assemblage. The disperser vacuum in the absence of L. cane greatly reduces the quantity of cleaned seeds deposited on the forest floor. For similar fleshy-fruited species where gut passage greatly increases survival, a simple lack of redundancy in seed consumption may be the primary driver of recruitment failure resulting from large-primate extirpation due to overhunting, with Janzen-Connell effects secondarily influencing recruitment success as a function of either dispersal distance or seed density.

TI  - Discriminating between large-scale oil palm plantations and smallholdings on tropical peatlands using vegetation indices and supervised classification of LANDSAT-8
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Tropical peat swamp forest is rapidly being converted into industrial-scale oil palm agriculture across South-east Asia. This has global and local environmental implications including habitat loss and carbon release. Monitoring oil palm expansion or land-use/land-cover on peatlands is feasible using remote sensing technology, however, there are few examples of assessments of different oil palm management systems. Three peatland land cover types were assessed and mapped using vegetation indices and supervised classifications of Landsat-8 level-2 imagery: peat swamp forest, large-scale oil palm plantation and smallholding. Firstly, we calculated and compared differences in vegetation indices (NDVI, EVI and SAVI) values between each of the land covers. Next, we mapped land cover using three classification methods - Support Vector Machine, Random Trees and Maximum Likelihood - with a single date and multi-temporal datasets. These were applied to the vegetation indices and also a three band Landsat image using band 2 (blue band), band 4 (red band) and band 5 (near-infrared band) i.e. false colour composite. The vegetation index assessment found significant differences in the NDVI, EVI and SAVI between peat swamp forest, large-scale plantation and smallholding. The NDVI in peat swamp forest was highest. In contrast, the EVI and SAVI in the peat swamp forest were the lowest. While the NDVI, EVI and SAVI in the large-scale plantations were greater than the smallholdings. Irrespective of landscape type, there were strong positive correlations between NDVI and EVI, NDVI and SAVI, and EVI and SAVI. For the land cover mapping, the best classifier was Random Trees with the multi-temporal Landsat bands 543 datasets with a mapping accuracy of 95.54% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.933. This study demonstrated that both vegetation indices and land cover mapping can provide planners and decision-makers with tools to monitor natural and production landscapes, managed under different systems in the tropics.

TI  - Socio-environmental predictors of Barmah forest virus transmission in coastal areas, Queensland, Australia
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE & INTERNATIONAL HEALTH
AB  - To assess the socio-environmental predictors of Barmah forest virus (BFV) transmission in coastal areas, Queensland, Australia.
   Data on BFV notified cases, climate, tidal levels and socioeconomic index for area (SEIFA) in six coastal cities, Queensland, for the period 1992-2001 were obtained from the relevant government agencies. Negative binomial regression models were used to assess the socio-environmental predictors of BFV transmission.
   The results show that maximum and minimum temperature, rainfall, relative humidity, high and low tide were statistically significantly associated with BFV incidence at lags 0-2 months. The fitted negative binomial regression models indicate a significant independent association of each of maximum temperature (beta = 0.139, P = 0.000), high tide (beta = 0.005, P = 0.000) and SEIFA index (beta = -0.010, P = 0.000) with BFV transmission after adjustment for confounding variables.
   The transmission of BFV disease in Queensland coastal areas seemed to be determined by a combination of local social and environmental factors. The model developed in this study may have applications in the control and prevention of BFV disease in these areas.

TI  - The multispectral separability of Costa Rican rainforest types with support vector machines and Random Forest decision trees
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Estimating the extent of tropical rainforest types is needed for biodiversity assessment and carbon accounting. In this study, we used statistical comparisons to determine the ability of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) bands and spectral vegetation indices to discriminate composition and structural types. A total of 144 old-growth forest plots established in northern Costa Rica were categorized via cluster analysis and ordination. Locations for palm swamps, forest regrowth and tree plantations were also acquired, making 11 forest types for separability analysis. Forest types classified using support vector machines (SVM), a theoretically superior method for solving complex classification problems, were compared with the random forest decision tree classifier (RF). Separability comparisons demonstrate that spectral data are sensitive to differences among forest types when tree species and structural similarity is low. SVM class accuracy was 66.6% for all forest types, minimally higher than the RF classifier (65.3%). TM bands and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) combined with digital elevation data notably increased accuracies for SVM (84.3%) and RF (86.7%) classifiers. Rainforest types discriminated here are typically limited to one or two categories for remote sensing classifications. Our results indicate that TM bands and ancillary data combined via machine learning algorithms can yield accurate and ecologically meaningful rainforest classifications important to national and international forest monitoring protocols.

TI  - Disease-Causing Agents in Cashew: A Review in a Tropical Cash Crop
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
AB  - Due to the high market value of cashew nut, cashew became a significantly important cash crop in many countries. Originating from Brazil, the plant was introduced into Africa, India, and Southeast Asia and is nowadays found across most of the tropical regions. However, the diseases that threaten and compromise crop production have not yet been comprehensively documented. The aim of this study was to examine the published scientific data on cashew diseases, to identify current knowledge gaps, and to present a review of the most important diseases and pathogens affecting cashew productivity. The most described diseases are caused by fungi genera-mainly Colletotrichum, Lasiodiplodia, and Erysiphe (worldwide); Cryptosporiopsis (East Africa); and recently Fusarium in Tanzania. Other fungal genera (e.g., Septoria, Pilgeriella, and Pestalotia) may correspond to emerging local cashew diseases that have not yet expanded to other geographic regions or for which records are lacking. Gummosis (Lasiodiplodia spp.), which is considered the most prevalent and damaging disease of cashew, has a pantropical distribution. There is large discrepancy concerning the causal agents of cashew diseases that might be explained by the lack of proper species identification through morpho-cultural and molecular approaches. This, in turn, can easily lead to misdiagnoses that have serious negative consequences for the implementation of specific control actions. It is important to establish a standardized identification workflow that will allow a reliable identification of the disease-causing agent and to determine the occurrence and/or expansion of a given pathogen across cashew-producing regions.

TI  - Evaluating Variable Selection and Machine Learning Algorithms for Estimating Forest Heights by Combining Lidar and Hyperspectral Data
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
AB  - Machine learning has been employed for various mapping and modeling tasks using input variables from different sources of remote sensing data. For feature selection involving high- spatial and spectral dimensionality data, various methods have been developed and incorporated into the machine learning framework to ensure an efficient and optimal computational process. This research aims to assess the accuracy of various feature selection and machine learning methods for estimating forest height using AISA (airborne imaging spectrometer for applications) hyperspectral bands (479 bands) and airborne light detection and ranging (lidar) height metrics (36 metrics), alone and combined. Feature selection and dimensionality reduction using Boruta (BO), principal component analysis (PCA), simulated annealing (SA), and genetic algorithm (GA) in combination with machine learning algorithms such as multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS), extra trees (ET), support vector regression (SVR) with radial basis function, and extreme gradient boosting (XGB) with trees (XGbtree and XGBdart) and linear (XGBlin) classifiers were evaluated. The results demonstrated that the combinations of BO-XGBdart and BO-SVR delivered the best model performance for estimating tropical forest height by combining lidar and hyperspectral data, with R-2 = 0.53 and RMSE = 1.7 m (18.4% of nRMSE and 0.046 m of bias) for BO-XGBdart and R-2 = 0.51 and RMSE = 1.8 m (15.8% of nRMSE and -0.244 m of bias) for BO-SVR. Our study also demonstrated the effectiveness of BO for variables selection; it could reduce 95% of the data to select the 29 most important variables from the initial 516 variables from lidar metrics and hyperspectral data.

T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
AB  - The main objective of this study was to produce forest fire susceptibility maps in the Nghe An province of Vietnam using machine learning models and GIS, namely Deep Neural Network (DNN), Hunger Games Search (HGS), Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO), Adaboost (ADB), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The application of these models included 1042 current and former forest fire points and 14 conditioning factors. The dataset was divided with a ratio of 70/30, with 70% for building the model and the remaining 30% for testing it. Each model was evaluated by various statistical indices and the results show that HGS performed best in constructing susceptibility maps and improving the performance of the DNN model compared to the reference models, with the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROC) of 0.967 The findings of this research may support decision-makers on sustainable land-use planning.

TI  - Utilization and transfer of forest genetic resources: A global review
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Over the last 200 years, genetic resources of forest trees have been increasingly transferred, within and outside of species' native distribution ranges, for forestry and for research and development (R&D). Transferred germplasm has been deployed to grow trees for numerous purposes, ranging from the production of wood and non-wood products to the provision of ecosystem services such as the restoration of forests for biodiversity conservation. The oldest form of R&D, provenance trials, revealed early on that seed origin has a major influence on the performance of planted trees. International provenance trials have been essential for selecting seed sources for reforestation and for improving tree germplasm through breeding. Many tree breeding programmes were initiated in the 1950s, but as one round of testing and selection typically takes decades, the most advanced of them are only in their third cycle. Recent advances in forest genomics have increased the understanding of the genetic basis of different traits, but it is unlikely that molecular marker-assisted approaches will quickly replace traditional tree breeding methods. Furthermore, provenance trials and progeny tests are still needed to complement new research approaches. Currently, seed of boreal and temperate trees for reforestation purposes are largely obtained from improved sources. The situation is similar for fast growing tropical and subtropical trees grown in plantations, but in the case of tropical hardwoods and many agroforestry trees, only limited tested or improved seed sources are available. Transfers of tree germplasm involve some risks of spreading pests and diseases, of introducing invasive tree species and of polluting the genetic make-up of already present tree populations. Many of these risks have been underestimated in the past, but they are now better understood and managed. Relatively few tree species used for forestry have become invasive, and the risk of spreading pests and diseases while transferring seed is considerably lower than when moving live plants. The implementation of the Nagoya Protocol on access to genetic resources and benefit sharing (ABS) may significantly change current transfer practices in the forestry sector by increasing transaction costs and the time needed to lawfully obtain forest genetic resources for R&D purposes. Many countries are likely to struggle to establish a well-functioning ABS regulatory system, slowing down the process of obtaining the necessary documentation for exchange. This is unfortunate, as climate change, outbreaks of pests and diseases, and continual pressure to support productivity, increase the need for transferring tree germplasm and accelerating R&D.

AB  - Species diversity and richness of Tabanidae (Diptera) in the Adolpho Ducke Reserve (03 degrees 08'S, 60 degrees 02'W), an upland area ("terra firme") in Central Amazonia, Brazil, was studied from February 1995 to January 1996. The tabanids were collected on three I ha-plots, denominated A (plateau), B (slope) and C (campinarana), by using five Malaise traps on each plot. In total, 7,285 specimens and 53 species were captured, representing an average of 137 specimens per species. Tabanus nematocallus was the most abundant species (It 159 individuals; 16%), followed by T. trivittatus (1.099 ind.; 15%), Stypommisa glandicolor (1.083 ind.; 14,9%), T. discus (959 ind., 13%) and T. callosus (776 ind.; 10,7%). In contrast to the characteristics of a tropical community, that is few common and lots of rare species, 52% of the collected species represented more than 10 specimens and only 15% were found to be "singletons". A higher species richness was found at plots B and C. The taxonomic composition at plot A was close to plot B when compared to plot C. The species similarity index among the three plots was more than 65%.

TI  - Molecular analysis of Bartonella spp. in liver tissue of bats from the Atlantic Forest biome, Brazil
T2  - SEMINA-CIENCIAS AGRARIAS
AB  - The genus Bartonella comprises gram-negative bacilli that possess tropism for erythrocytes and endothelial cells in animals of the orders Rodentia, Lagomorpha, Carnivora, Artiodactyla, Eulipotyphla, and Chiroptera. Bacterial infection may be associated with lymphadenitis, endocarditis, bacillary angiomatosis, and peliosis hepatis. Thirteen species of Bartonella are recognized as zoonotic and bats are considered to be their potential reservoirs. This study aimed to analyze the occurrence of Bartonella spp. in livers of neotropical bats belonging to the families Molossidae, Phyllostomidae, and Vespertilionidae, classified into 21 genera from the Atlantic Forest biome in Sao Paulo. A total of 341 (n = 341) chiropterans samples were tested for the presence of citrate synthase (gltA) gene of Bartonella by partial amplification using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Samples of two bats (0.6%) of the species Glossophaga soricina from the municipality of Sao Roque were tested positive for gltA gene. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that sequences clustered in a clade that was close to the Bartonella sp. detected in G. soricina, which was collected from the Cerrado biome in Tocantins, Brazil. Despite a low prevalence of the detected infection, results indicated that neotropical bats from the Atlantic Forest were potential hosts of Bartonella spp., which might be related to the maintenance of a wild enzootic cycle of the bacterium. Additional studies, particularly on bats of genus Glossophaga, are required to elucidate the dynamics of intraspecific relationships between etiologic agent-vector-hosts.

TI  - Assessing micro-macroparasite selective pressures and anthropogenic disturbance as drivers of immune gene diversity in a Neotropical wild cat
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Anthropogenic environmental change is reducing available habitat for wild species, providing novel selection pressures such as infectious diseases and causing species to interact in new ways. The potential for emerging infectious diseases and zoonoses at the interface between humans, domestic animals, and wild species is a key global concern. In vertebrates, diversity at the major histocompatibility complex MHC is critical to disease resilience, and its study in wild populations provides insights into eco-evolutionary dynamics that human activities alter. In natural populations, variation at MHC loci is partly maintained by balancing selection, driven by pathogenic selective pressures. We hypothesize that MHC genetic diversity differs between guigna populations inhabiting human-dominated landscapes (higher pathogen pressures) versus more natural habitats (lower pathogen pressures). We predict that MHC diversity in guignas would be highest in human-dominated landscapes compared with continuous forest habitats. We also expected to find higher MHC diversity in guignas infected with micro and macro parasites (higher parasite load) versus non infected guignas. We characterized for the first time the genetic diversity at three MHC class I and II exons in 128 wild guignas (Leopardus guigna) across their distribution range in Chile (32-46 degrees S) and Argentina, representing landscapes with varying levels of human disturbance. We integrated MHC sequence diversity with multiple measures of anthropogenic disturbance and both micro and macro parasite infection data. We also assessed signatures of positive selection acting on MHC genes. We found significantly higher MHC class I diversity in guignas inhabiting landscapes where houses were present, and with lower percentage of vegetation cover, and also in animals with more severe cardiorespiratory helminth infection (richness and intensity) and micro-macroparasite co-infection. This comprehensive, landscape-level assessment further enhances our knowledge on the evolutionary dynamics and adaptive potential of vertebrates in the face of emerging infectious disease threats and increasing anthropogenic impacts.

TI  - Forest cover and climate as potential drivers for dengue fever in Sumatra and Kalimantan 2006-2016: a spatiotemporal analysis
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE & INTERNATIONAL HEALTH
AB  - Objectives To describe and quantify spatiotemporal trends of dengue fever at district level in Sumatra and Kalimantan, Indonesia in relation to forest cover and climatic factors. Methods A spatial ecological study design was used to analyse monthly surveillance data of notified dengue fever cases from January 2006 to December 2016 in the 154 districts of Sumatra and 56 districts of Kalimantan. A multivariate, zero-inflated Poisson regression model was developed with a conditional autoregressive prior structure with posterior parameters estimated using Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation with Gibbs sampling. Results There were 230 745 cases in Sumatra and 132 186 cases in Kalimantan during the study period. In Sumatra, the risk of dengue fever decreased by 9% (95% credible interval [CrI] 8.5-9.5%) for a 1% increase in forest cover and by 12.2% (95% CrI 11.9-12.6%) for a 1% increase in relative humidity. In Kalimantan, dengue fever risk fell by 17.6% (95% CrI 17.1-18.1%) for a 1% increase in relative humidity and rose by 7.6% (95% CrI 6.9-8.4%) for a 1 degrees C increase in minimum temperature. There was no significant residual spatial clustering in Sumatra after accounting for climate and demographic variables. In Kalimantan, high residual risk areas were primarily centred in North and East of the island. Conclusions Dengue fever in Sumatra and Kalimantan was highly seasonal and associated with climate factors and deforestation. Incorporation of climate indicators into risk-based surveillance might be warranted for dengue fever in Indonesia.

TI  - Tracking Animal Location and Activity with an Automated Radio Telemetry System in a Tropical Rainforest
T2  - COMPUTER JOURNAL
AB  - How do animals use their habitat? Where do they go and what do they do? These basic questions are key not only to understanding a species' ecology and evolution, but also for addressing many of the environmental challenges we currently face, including problems posed by invasive species, the spread of zoonotic diseases and declines in wildlife populations due to anthropogenic climate and land-use changes. Monitoring the movements and activities of wild animals can be difficult, especially when the species in question are small, cryptic or move over large areas. In this paper, we describe an Automated Radio-Telemetry System (ARTS) that we designed and built on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama to overcome these challenges. We describe the hardware and software we used to implement the ARTS, and discuss the scientific successes we have had using the system, as well as the logistical challenges we faced in maintaining the system in real-world, rainforest conditions. The ARTS uses automated radio-telemetry receivers mounted on 40-m towers topped with arrays of directional antennas to track the activity and location of radio-collared study animals, 24 h a day, 7 days a week. These receiving units are connected by a wireless network to a server housed in the laboratory on BCI, making these data available in real time to researchers via a web-accessible database. As long as study animals are within the range of the towers, the ARTS system collects data more frequently than typical animal-borne global positioning system collars (similar to 12 locations/h) with lower accuracy (approximately 50 m) but at much reduced cost per tag (similar to 10X less expensive). The geographic range of ARTS, like all VHF telemetry, is affected by the size of the radio-tag as well as its position in the forest (e. g. tags in the canopy transmit farther than those on the forest floor). We present a model of signal propagation based on landscape conditions, which quantifies these effects and identifies sources of interference, including weather events and human activity. ARTS has been used to track 374 individual animals from 38 species, including 17 mammal species, 12 birds, 7 reptiles or amphibians, as well as two species of plant seeds. These data elucidate the spatio-temporal dynamics of animal activity and movement at the site and have produced numerous peer-reviewed publications, student theses, magazine articles, educational programs and film documentaries. These data are also relevant to long-term population monitoring and conservation plans. Both the successes and the failures of the ARTS system are applicable to broader sensor network applications and are valuable for advancing sensor network research.

TI  - A NEW FOCUS OF SCRUB TYPHUS IN TROPICAL AUSTRALIA
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - A new focus of scrub typhus (Rickettsia tsutsugamushi) is described in a remote rain forest region of the Northern Territory of Australia. Five serologically confirmed cases, two near fatal with multisystem involvement, have occurred since the area became accessible to tourists. As tourism increases, other remote foci of vectors and organisms may also be recognized in tropical Australia.

TI  - Forest Biomass and Carbon Stock Quantification Using Airborne LiDAR Data: A Case Study Over Huntington Wildlife Forest in the Adirondack Park
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
AB  - In response to the need for a better understanding of biosphere-atmosphere interactions as well as carbon cycles, there is a high demand for monitoring key forest parameters such as biomass and carbon stock. These monitoring tasks provide insight into relevant biogeochemical processes as well as anthropogenic impacts on the environment. Recent advances in remote sensing techniques such as Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) enable scientists to nondestructively identify structural and biophysical characteristics of forests. This study quantified forest biomass and carbon stock at the plot level from small-footprint full-waveform LiDAR data collected over a montane mixed forest in September 2011, using seven modeling methods: ordinary least squares, generalized additive model, Cubist, bagging, random forest, boosted regression trees, and support vector regression (SVR). Results showed that higher percentiles of canopy height and intensity made significant contributions to the predictions, while other explanatory variables related to canopy geometric volume, structure, and canopy coverage were generally not as important. Boosted regression trees provided the highest accuracy for model calibration, whereas SVR and ordinary least squares performed slightly better than the other models in model validation. In this study, the simple ordinary least squares approach performed just as well as any advanced machine learning method.

TI  - Land Use Influences Mosquito Communities and Disease Risk on Remote Tropical Islands: A Case Study Using a Novel Sampling Technique
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Land use changes, such as deforestation and urbanization, can influence interactions between vectors, hosts, and pathogens. The consequences may result in the appearance and rise of mosquito-borne diseases, especially in remote tropical regions. Tropical regions can be the hotspots for the emergence of diseases due to high biological diversity and complex species interactions. Furthermore, frontier areas are often haphazardly surveyed as a result of inadequate or expensive sampling techniques, which limit early detection and medical intervention. We trialed a novel sampling technique of nonpowered traps and a carbon dioxide attractant derived from yeast and sugar to explore how land use influences mosquito communities on four remote, tropical islands in the Australian Torres Strait. Using this technique, we collected > 11,000 mosquitoes from urban and sylvan habitats. We found that human land use significantly affected mosquito communities. Mosquito abundances and diversity were higher in sylvan habitats compared with urban areas, resulting in significantly different community compositions between the two habitats. An important outcome of our study was determining that there were greater numbers of disease-vectoring species associated with human habitations. On the basis of these findings, we believe that our novel sampling technique is a realistic tool for assessing mosquito communities in remote regions.

TI  - Possible shift in macaque trophic level following a century of biodiversity loss in Singapore
T2  - PRIMATES
AB  - Biodiversity loss in tropical forests is a major problem in conservation biology, and nowhere is this more dire than in Southeast Asia. Deforestation and the associated loss of species may trigger shifts in habitat and feeding preferences of persisting species. In this study, I compared the habitat use and diet of long-tailed macaque (Macaca fascicularis) populations in Singapore from two time periods: museum specimens originally collected between 1893 and 1944, and living macaques sampled in 2009. I collected hair and used stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis to identify temporal changes in dietary source and trophic position, respectively. delta(13)C ratios were virtually identical, suggesting that macaques foraged in similar habitats during both time periods. However, delta(15)N ratios decreased considerably over time, suggesting that macaques today feed at a lower trophic level than previously. This decline in trophic level may be because of the disappearance or decline of other species that compete with macaques for fruit. This study highlights the effect of biodiversity loss on persisting species in degraded habitats of Southeast Asia, and improves our understanding of how species will adapt to further human-driven changes in tropical forest habitats.

TI  - Modeling hantavirus reservoir species dominance in high seroprevalence areas on the Azuero Peninsula of Panama
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Habitat fragmentation commonly influences distribution of zoonotic disease reservoirs. In Panama, populations of rodent hosts of hantaviruses are favored by small habitat fragments isolated by agricultural lands. We expected a similar relationship between landscape characteristics and host distribution at fine geographical scales in southern Panama. The relative abundance of Zygodontomys brevicauda, the primary host for "Calabazo" virus, and other rodents was assessed at 24 sites within the Azuero Peninsula. We used satellite imagery to produce several spatial variables that described landscape; however, only slope was consistently related to abundances of the two most dominant rodent species. Using regression, we constructed a spatial model of areas of Z. brevicauda dominance, which in turn relates to higher infection rates. The model predicts highest abundances of Z. brevicauda in flat areas, where humans also dominate. These predictions have important ecological and conservation implications that associate diversity loss, topography, and human land use.

TI  - Atypical human trypanosomosis: Potentially emerging disease with lack of understanding
T2  - ZOONOSES AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Trypanosomes are the hemoflagellate kinetoplastid protozoan parasites affecting a wide range of vertebrate hosts having insufficient host specificity. Climatic change, deforestation, globalization, trade agreements, close association and genetic selection in links with environmental, vector, reservoir and potential susceptible hosts' parameters have led to emergence of atypical human trypanosomosis (a-HT). Poor recording of such neglected tropical disease, low awareness in health professions and farming community has approached a serious intimidation for mankind. Reports of animal Trypanosoma species are now gradually increasing in humans, and lack of any compiled literature has diluted the issue. In the present review, global reports of livestock and rodent trypanosomes reported from human beings are assembled and discrepancies with the available literature are discussed along with morphological features of Trypanosoma species. We have described 21 human cases from the published information. Majority of cases 10 (47%) are due to T. lewisi, followed by 5 (24%) cases of T. evansi, 4 (19%) cases of T. brucei and 1 (5%) case each of T. vivax and T. congolense. Indian subcontinent witnessed 13 cases of a-HT, of which 9 cases are reported from India, which includes 7 cases of T. lewisi and 2 cases of T. evansi. Apart from, a-HT case reports, epidemiological investigation and treatment aspects are also discussed. An attempt has been made to provide an overview of the current situation of atypical human trypanosomosis caused by salivarian animal Trypanosoma globally. The probable role of Trypanosoma lytic factors (TLF) present in normal human serum (NHS) in providing innate immunity against salivarian animal Trypanosoma species and the existing paradox in medical science after the finding on intact functional apolipoprotein L1 (ApoL1) in Vietnam T. evansi Type A case is also discussed to provide an update on all aspects of a-HT. Insufficient data and poor reporting in Asian and African countries are the major hurdle resulting in under-reporting of a-HT, which is a potential emerging threat. Therefore, concerted efforts must be directed to address attentiveness, preparedness and regular surveillance in suspected areas with training of field technicians, medical health professionals and veterinarians. Enhancing a one health approach is specifically important in case of trypanosomosis.

TI  - Support vector machines to map rare and endangered native plants in Pacific islands forests
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
AB  - It is critical to know accurately the ecological and geographic range of rare and endangered species for biodiversity conservation and management. In this study, we used support vector machines (SVM) for modeling rare species distribution and we compared it to another emerging machine learning classifier called random forests (RF). The comparison was performed using three native and endemic plants found at low- to mid-elevation in the island of Moorea (French Polynesia, South Pacific) and considered rare because of scarce occurrence records: Lepinia taitensis (28 observed occurrences). Pouteria tahitensis (20 occurrences) and Santalum insulare var. raiateense (81 occurrences). We selected a set of biophysical variables to describe plant habitats in tropical high volcanic islands, including topographic descriptors and an overstory vegetation map. The former were extracted from a digital elevation model (DEM) and the latter is a result of a SVM classification of spectral and textural bands from very high resolution Quickbird satellite imagery. Our results show that SVM slightly but constantly outperforms RF in predicting the distribution of rare species based on the kappa coefficient and the area under the curve (AUC) achieved by both classifiers. The predicted potential habitats of the three rare species are considerably wider than their currently observed distribution ranges. We hypothesize that the causes of this discrepancy are strong anthropogenic disturbances that have impacted low- to mid-elevation forests in the past and present. There is an urgent need to set up conservation strategies for the endangered plants found in these shrinking habitats on the Pacific islands. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Plant health and global change - some implications for landscape management
T2  - BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS
AB  - Global change (climate change together with other worldwide anthropogenic processes such as increasing trade, air pollution and urbanization) will affect plant health at the genetic, individual, population and landscape level. Direct effects include ecosystem stress due to natural resources shortage or imbalance. Indirect effects include (i) an increased frequency of natural detrimental phenomena, (ii) an increased pressure due to already present pests and diseases, (iii) the introduction of new invasive species either as a result of an improved suitability of the climatic conditions or as a result of increased trade, and (iv) the human response to global change. In this review, we provide an overview of recent studies on terrestrial plant health in the presence of global change factors. We summarize the links between climate change and some key issues in plant health, including tree mortality, changes in wildfire regimes, biological invasions and the role of genetic diversity for ecosystem resilience. Prediction and management of global change effects are complicated by interactions between globalization, climate and invasive plants and/or pathogens. We summarize practical guidelines for landscape management and draw general conclusions from an expanding body of literature.

TI  - Molecular Detection of <i>Rickettsia</i> and Other Bacteria in Ticks and Birds in an Urban Fragment of Tropical Dry Forest in Magdalena, Colombia
T2  - LIFE-BASEL
AB  - Birds are important hosts in the life cycle of some species of ticks. In Colombia, there are few eco-epidemiological studies of tick-borne diseases; the existing ones have been focused on areas where unusual outbreaks have occurred. This study describes the identification of ticks collected from birds and vegetation, and the detection of bacteria in those ticks and in blood samples from birds in an urban fragment of tropical dry forest in the department of Magdalena, Colombia. Bird sampling was carried out monthly in 2021, and 367 birds, distributed among 41 species, were captured. All collected ticks were identified as Amblyomma sp. or Amblyomma dissimile. The presence of rickettsiae in ticks collected from birds was evaluated by molecular analysis of the gltA, ompA and sca1 genes. 16S rRNA meta-taxonomy was used to evaluate rickettsiae in ticks collected from vegetation and in blood samples from birds. The presence of the species "Candidatus Rickettsia colombianensi" was detected in ticks from birds. Bacteria of the family Rickettsiacea was the most abundant in ticks collected from vegetation. Bacteria of the families Staphylococcaceae, Comamonadaceae and Pseudomonadaceae were prevalent in the samples of blood from birds. Rickettsia spp. was also detected in low abundance in some of the bird blood samples.

TI  - Mosquito communities and disease risk influenced by land use change and seasonality in the Australian tropics
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
AB  - Background: Anthropogenic land use changes have contributed considerably to the rise of emerging and re-emerging mosquito-borne diseases. These diseases appear to be increasing as a result of the novel juxtapositions of habitats and species that can result in new interchanges of vectors, diseases and hosts. We studied whether the mosquito community structure varied between habitats and seasons and whether known disease vectors displayed habitat preferences in tropical Australia.
   Methods: Using CDC model 512 traps, adult mosquitoes were sampled across an anthropogenic disturbance gradient of grassland, rainforest edge and rainforest interior habitats, in both the wet and dry seasons. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMS) ordinations were applied to examine major gradients in the composition of mosquito and vector communities.
   Results: We captured similar to 13,000 mosquitoes from 288 trap nights across four study sites. A community analysis identified 29 species from 7 genera. Even though mosquito abundance and richness were similar between the three habitats, the community composition varied significantly in response to habitat type. The mosquito community in rainforest interiors was distinctly different to the community in grasslands, whereas forest edges acted as an ecotone with shared communities from both forest interiors and grasslands. We found two community patterns that will influence disease risk at out study sites, first, that disease vectoring mosquito species occurred all year round. Secondly, that anthropogenic grasslands adjacent to rainforests may increase the probability of novel disease transmission through changes to the vector community on rainforest edges, as most disease transmitting species predominantly occurred in grasslands.
   Conclusion: Our results indicate that the strong influence of anthropogenic land use change on mosquito communities could have potential implications for pathogen transmission to humans and wildlife.

TI  - Comparative performance of convolutional neural network, weighted and conventional support vector machine and random forest for classifying tree species using hyperspectral and photogrammetric data
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
AB  - The classification of tree species can significantly benefit from high spatial and spectral information acquired by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) associated with advanced classification methods. This study investigated the following topics concerning the classification of 16 tree species in two subtropical forest fragments of Southern Brazil: i) the potential integration of UAV-borne hyperspectral images with 3D information derived from their photogrammetric point cloud (PPC); ii) the performance of two machine learning methods (support vector machine - SVM and random forest - RF) when employing different datasets at a pixel and individual tree crown (ITC) levels; iii) the potential of two methods for dealing with the imbalanced sample set problem: a new weighted SVM (wSVM) approach, which attributes different weights to each sample and class, and a deep learning classifier (convolutional neural network - CNN), associated with a previous step to balance the sample set; and finally, iv) the potential of this last classifier for tree species classification as compared to the above mentioned machine learning methods. Results showed that the inclusion of the PPC features to the hyperspectral data provided a great accuracy increase in tree species classification results when conventional machine learning methods were applied, between 13 and 17% depending on the classifier and the study area characteristics. When using the PPC features and the canopy height model (CHM), associated with the majority vote (MV) rule, the SVM, wSVM and RF classifiers reached accuracies similar to the CNN, which outperformed these classifiers for both areas when considering the pixel-based classifications (overall accuracy of 84.4% in Area 1, and 74.95% in Area 2). The CNN was between 22% and 26% more accurate than the SVM and RF when only the hyperspectral bands were employed. The wSVM provided a slight increase in accuracy not only for some lesser represented classes, but also some major classes in Area 2. While conventional machine learning methods are faster, they demonstrated to be less stable to changes in datasets, depending on prior segmentation and hand-engineered features to reach similar accuracies to those attained by the CNN. To date, CNNs have been barely explored for the classification of tree species, and CNN-based classifications in the literature have not dealt with hyperspectral data specifically focusing on tropical environments. This paper thus presents innovative strategies for classifying tree species in subtropical forest areas at a refined legend level, integrating UAV-borne 2D hyperspectral and 3D photogrammetric data and relying on both deep and conventional machine learning approaches.

TI  - Environmental change and infectious disease: How new roads affect the transmission of diarrheal pathogens in rural Ecuador
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
AB  - Environmental change plays a large role in the emergence of infectious disease. The construction of a new road in a previously roadless area of northern coastal Ecuador provides a valuable natural experiment to examine how changes in the social and natural environment, mediated by road construction, affect the epidemiology of diarrheal diseases. Twenty-one villages were randomly selected to capture the full distribution of village population size and distance from a main road (remoteness), and these were compared with the major population center of the region, Elorbon, that lies on the road. Estimates of enteric pathogen infection rates were obtained from case-control studies at the village level. Higher rates of infection were found in nonremote vs. remote villages [pathogenic Escherichia coli: odds ratio (OR) = 8.4, confidence interval (CI) 1.6, 43.5; rotavirus: OR = 4.0, CI 1.3, 12.1; and Giardia: OR = 1.9, CI 1.3, 2.7]. Higher rates of all-cause diarrhea were found in Borbon compared with the 21 villages (RR = 2.0, CI 1.5, 2.8), as well as when comparing nonremote and remote villages (OR = 2.7, CI 1.5, 4.8). Social network data collected in parallel offered a causal link between remoteness and disease. The significant and consistent trends across viral, bacterial, and protozoan pathogens suggest the importance of considering a broad range of pathogens with differing epidemiological patterns when assessing the environmental impact of new roads. This study provides insight into the initial health impacts that roads have on communities and into the social and environmental processes that create these impacts.

TI  - From serological surveys to disease burden: a modelling pipeline for Chagas disease
T2  - PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB  - In 2012, the World Health Organization (WHO) set the elimination of Chagas disease intradomiciliary vectorial transmission as a goal by 2020. After a decade, some progress has been made, but the new 2021-2030 WHO roadmap has set even more ambitious targets. Innovative and robust modelling methods are required to monitor progress towards these goals. We present a modelling pipeline using local seroprevalence data to obtain national disease burden estimates by disease stage. Firstly, local seroprevalence information is used to estimate spatio-temporal trends in the Force-of-Infection (FoI). FoI estimates are then used to predict such trends across larger and fine-scale geographical areas. Finally, predicted FoI values are used to estimate disease burden based on a disease progression model. Using Colombia as a case study, we estimated that the number of infected people would reach 506 000 (95% credible interval (CrI) = 395 000-648 000) in 2020 with a 1.0% (95%CrI = 0.8-1.3%) prevalence in the general population and 2400 (95%CrI = 1900-3400) deaths (approx. 0.5% of those infected). The interplay between a decrease in infection exposure (FoI and relative proportion of acute cases) was overcompensated by a large increase in population size and gradual population ageing, leading to an increase in the absolute number of Chagas disease cases over time.This article is part of the theme issue 'Challenges and opportunities in the fight against neglected tropical diseases: a decade from the London Declaration on NTDs'.

TI  - Interconnectedness of Ecosystem Services Potential with Land Use/Land Cover Change Dynamics in Western Uganda
T2  - LAND
AB  - Understanding the evolution of land use/land cover change (LULCC) and how it shapes current and future ecosystem services (ES) supply potential remains critical in sustainable natural resource management. Community perception of historic LULCC was reconciled with previous study via remote sensing/geographical information systems using recall data in the Budongo-Bugoma landscape in Uganda. Then, a CA-Markovian prediction model of a LULC situation in 2040 under business as usual (BAU) and forest restoration scenarios was constructed. Additionally, we assessed the perceived proximate and underlying drivers of LULCC, and how LULCC shapes ecosystem services potential using household surveys. The perceived LULCC trend for the past three decades (1990-2020) corresponded with previous studies showing grassland, bushland, tropical high forest, and wetland cover declined greatly, while subsistence farmland, commercial farmland, and built-up areas had a great increment. The predicted LULC under (i) the business as usual scenario showed a continued decline of natural LULC while anthropogenic LULC increased greatly, tending to cover half of the landscape area; (ii) forest restoration under different levels showed an improvement of forest cover and other native LULC classes with a decline in mostly subsistence farmland. The proximate drivers were in three principal components (soil infertility, subsistence farming, drought; infrastructural development, commercial farming, overstocking of livestock, pest and disease challenges; tree planting), while underlying drivers were in two principal components (technology adoption, corruption of environment stewards, policy implementation gaps; cultural gaps). Food and cash crops were perceived to be the most important ecosystem services in the landscape. Generally, the landscape ES supply potential was dwindling and predicted to continue with a similar trend under BAU, despite the increment in ES contribution of subsistence and commercial farmland. Forest restoration would slightly improve the landscape ES potential but would cause a decline in subsistence farmland, which would result in either a threat to food/livelihood security or a livelihood shift. We recommend combined interventions that seek to achieve a progressive frontier that achieves development needs and priorities based on national need such as food security through local level production with recognition for sustainable availability of ecosystem services.

TI  - NTDs V.2.0: "Blue Marble Health"-Neglected Tropical Disease Control and Elimination in a Shifting Health Policy Landscape
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - The concept of the neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) was established in the aftermath of the Millennium Development Goals. Here, we summarize the emergence of several new post-2010 global health documents and policies, and how they may alter the way we frame the world's major NTDs since they were first highlighted. These documents include a new Global Burden of Disease 2010 Study that identifies visceral leishmaniasis and food-borne trematode infections as priority diseases beyond the seven NTDs originally targeted by preventive chemotherapy, a London Declaration for access to essential medicines, and a 2013 World Health Assembly resolution on NTDs. Additional information highlights an emerging dengue fever pandemic. New United Nations resolutions on women and the non-communicable diseases (NCDs) have not yet embraced NTDs, which may actually be the most common afflictions of girls and women and represent a stealth cause of NCDs. NTDs also have important direct and collateral effects on HIV/AIDS and malaria, and there is now a robust evidence base and rationale for incorporating NTDs into the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. "Blue marble health" is an added concept that recognizes a paradoxical NTD disease burden among the poor living in G20 (Group of Twenty) and other wealthy countries, requiring these nations to take greater ownership for both disease control and research and development. As we advance past the year 2015, it will be essential to incorporate global NTD elimination into newly proposed Sustainable Development Goals.

TI  - Commensal Rodent Habitat Expansion Enhances Arthropod Disease Vectors on a Tropical Volcanic Island
T2  - FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE
AB  - On volcanic islands, the release of animals from predators and competitors can lead to increased body size and population density as well as the expanded habitat use of introduced animals relative to their mainland counterparts. Such alterations might facilitate the spread of diseases on islands when these exotic animals also carry pathogenic agents; however, this has rarely been investigated. The commensal Asian house rat (Rattus tanezumi) is confined to human residential surroundings in mainland Taiwan but can be observed in the forests of nearby Orchid Island, which is a tropical volcanic island. Orchid Island is also a hot spot for scrub typhus, a lethal febrile disease transmitted by larval trombiculid mites (chiggers) that are infected primarily with the rickettsia Orientia tsutsugamushi (OT). We predicted an increase in chigger abundance when rodents (the primary host of chiggers) invade forests from human settlements since soils are largely absent in the latter habitat but necessary for the survival of nymphal and adult mites. A trimonthly rodent survey at 10 sites in three habitats (human residential, grassland, and forest) found only R. tanezumi and showed more R. tanezumi and chiggers in forests than in human residential sites. There was a positive association between rodent and chigger abundance, as well as between rodent body weight and chigger load. Lastly, >95% of chiggers were Leptotrombidium deliense and their OT infection rates were similar among all habitats. Our study demonstrated potentially elevated risks of scrub typhus when this commensal rat species is allowed to invade natural habitats on islands. Additionally, while the success of invasive species can be ascribed to their parasites being left behind, island invaders might instead obtain more parasites if the parasite requires only a single host (e.g., trombiculid mite), is a host generalist (e.g., L. deliense), and is transferred from unsuitable to suitable habitats (i.e., human settlements on the mainland to forests on an island).

TI  - Trade-offs and spatial variation of functional traits of tree species in a subtropical forest in southern Brazil
T2  - IFOREST-BIOGEOSCIENCES AND FORESTRY
AB  - Plant functional traits have been recognized as important factors related to the ecological strategies of species in forest ecosystems. We examined the relationships between functional traits and both tree species performance and environmental conditions in a subtropical forest in Brazil. Over four years (2008-2012), we investigated how demographic rates were related to functional traits (wood density, leaf area and tree height) of 20 species sampled within 50 plots of 10 x 20 m, which had previously evaluated as to environmental conditions. Non-metric multidimensional scaling was used to order the species by their functional traits. The demographic rates were fit a posteriori to the ordination, with significant rates (p < 0.05) plotted as vectors. The relationships between environmental conditions and the community-weighted means (CWMs) of trait values were verified using redundancy analysis. CWM wood density was positively correlated with soil pH. CWM leaf area and CWM maximum tree height were both negatively correlated with altitude and positively correlated with soil magnesium (Mg) content. The taller species with lower wood density, which occupied the forest canopy, had a greater diameter increment and lower recruitment than did the shortest species with higher wood density. The shorter species with higher wood density, which occupied the understory, had greater recruitment and a greater increase in abundance than did the taller/lower-wood-density species. Our study (i) revealed changes in the forest related to the light environment, with an increase in the relative participation of shade-tolerant species with higher wood densities, and (ii) detected small-scale spatial variation in community traits as a response to variations in soil chemical properties and topography.

TI  - Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus: the problem is not over for tropical America
T2  - ANNALS OF CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY AND ANTIMICROBIALS
AB  - The equine encephalitis viruses, Venezuelan (VEEV), East (EEEV) and West (WEEV), belong to the genus alphavirus, family Togaviridae and still represent a threat for human and animal public health in the Americas. In both, these infections are characterized by high viremia, rash, fever, encephalitis and death. VEEV encephalitis is similar, clinically, to other arboviral diseases, such as dengue, Zika or chikungunya. Most of the alphaviruses are transmitted between vertebrates and mosquitoes. They are able to replicate in a wide number of hosts, including mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibian and arthropods. The VEEV has enzootic and epizootic transmission cycles. At the enzootic one, enzootic strains (subtype I, serotypes D-F and serotypes II-VI) are continuously circulating between mosquitoes and wild rodents in tropical forests and mangroves of the Americas. The main reseroivrs are wild rodent species of the subfamily Sigmodontinae. However, bats can be also accidental reservoirs of VEEV. In this article, we reviewed the main features, epidemiology, clinical aspects and the current perspectives of the VEEV.

TI  - 'When she rises, we all rise': a crowdsourcing challenge to increase women's participation in an infectious diseases research fellowship
T2  - BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB  - BackgroundWomen are under-represented in many mid-career infectious diseases research fellowships, including a TDR fellowship for low- and middle-income country (LMIC) researchers. TDR solicited creative ideas as part of a challenge contest to increase the number of women fellowship applicants. The purpose of this study is to examine themes from submitted ideas and the impact of implementing the top three ideas on the number of women applicants.MethodsWe solicited ideas for modifying the TDR fellowship using a crowdsourcing challenge. Then we used a mixed methods approach to evaluate texts submitted in response to the challenge. The qualitative analysis identified themes from eligible submissions. The quantitative analysis examined the mean score (1-10 scale) assigned to submitted ideas and also the number of eligible women applicants before (2014-7) and after (2018) implementing the top three ideas.ResultsWe received 311 ideas on improving women's participation in this fellowship from 63 countries. Among all ideas, 282 (91%) were from women and 286 (92%) were from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Thirty-three (17%) ideas received an overall mean score of 7.0 or greater. The top three ideas included enhanced social media communication targeting women, improving career mentorship, and creating a nomination system to nudge women applicants. These ideas were implemented as part of the 2018 fellowship application cycle. The number of eligible women applicants increased from 11 in 2016 to 48 in 2018. The number of eligible men applicants increased from 55 in 2016 to 114 in 2018. Women represent 44% (8/18) of the 2018 cohort.ConclusionThis suggests that the challenge contest resulted in strong participation from women in LMICs. The three top ideas likely contributed to a greater number of women applicants to this mid-career fellowship. Further ways of enhancing women's participation in global health training are needed.

TI  - Predicting the Impact of Climate Change on the Distribution of <i>Rhipicephalus sanguineus</i> in the Americas
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Climate change may influence the incidence of infectious diseases including those transmitted by ticks. Rhipicephalus sanguineus complex has a worldwide distribution and transmits Rickettsial infections that could cause high mortality rates if untreated. We assessed the potential effects of climate change on the distribution of R. sanguineus in the Americas in 2050 and 2070 using the general circulation model CanESM5 and two shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs), SSP2-4.5 (moderate emissions) and SSP2-8.5 (high emissions). A total of 355 occurrence points of R. sanguineus and eight uncorrelated bioclimatic variables were entered into a maximum entropy algorithm (MaxEnt) to produce 50 replicates per scenario. The area under the curve (AUC) value for the consensus model (>0.90) and the partial ROC value (>1.28) indicated a high predictive capacity. The models showed that the geographic regions currently suitable for R. sanguineus will remain stable in the future, but also predicted increases in habitat suitability in the Western U.S., Venezuela, Brazil and Bolivia. Scenario 4.5 showed an increase in habitat suitability for R. sanguineus in tropical and subtropical regions in both 2050 and 2070. Habitat suitability is predicted to remain constant in moist broadleaf forests and deserts but is predicted to decrease in flooded grasslands and savannas. Using the high emissions SSP5-8.5 scenario, habitat suitability in tropical and subtropical coniferous forests and temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands was predicted to be constant in 2050. In 2070, however, habitat suitability was predicted to decrease in tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests and increase in tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests. Our findings suggest that the current and potential future geographic distributions can be used in evidence-based strategies in the design of control plans aimed at reducing the risk of exposure to zoonotic diseases transmitted by R. sanguineus.

TI  - Evaluation of Tropical Cyclone Disaster Loss Using Machine Learning Algorithms with an eXplainable Artificial Intelligence Approach
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - In the context of global warming, tropical cyclones (TCs) have garnered significant attention as one of the most severe natural disasters in China, particularly in terms of assessing the disaster losses. This study aims to evaluate the TC disaster loss (TCDL) using machine learning (ML) algorithms and identify the impact of specific feature factors on the prediction of model with an eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) approach, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). The results show that LightGBM outperforms Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Naive Bayes (NB) for estimating the TCDL grades, achieving the highest accuracy value of 0.86. According to the SHAP values, the three most important factors in the LightGBM classifier model are proportion of stations with rainfall exceeding 50 mm (ProRain), maximum wind speed (MaxWind), and maximum daily rainfall (MaxRain). Specifically, in the estimation of high TCDL grade, events characterized with MaxWind exceeding 30 m/s, MaxRain exceeding 200 mm, and ProRain exceeding 30% tend to exhibit a higher susceptibility to TC disaster due to positive SHAP values. This study offers a valuable tool for decision-makers to develop scientific strategies in the risk management of TC disaster.

TI  - Leishmaniases in Bolivia: Comprehensive Review and Current Status
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - The leishmaniases are protozoan, zoonotic diseases transmitted to human and other mammal hosts by the bite of phlebotomine sandflies. Bolivia has the highest incidence of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) in Latin America (LA), with 33 cases per 100,000 population reported in 2006. CL is endemic in seven of the country's nine administrative departments. Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is comparatively rare and is restricted to one single focus. Most CL cases are caused by Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis (85% cases); VL is caused by L. (L.) infantum. Seven sandfly species are incriminated as vectors and Leishmania infections have been detected in several non-human mammal hosts. Transmission is associated with forest-related activities, but recently, cases of autochthonous, urban transmission were reported. Because most cases are caused by L. (V) braziliensis, Bolivia reports the greatest ratio (i.e., up to 20% of all cases) of mucosal leishmaniasis to localized CL cases in LA. Per national guidelines, both CL and VL cases are microscopically diagnosed and treated with pentavalent antimony.

TI  - Occurrence of potential wild hosts of <i>Echinococcus vogeli</i> in the forests of southwestern Brazilian Amazonia
T2  - BIOTA NEOTROPICA
AB  - The helminth Echinococcus vogeli Rausch & Bernstein, 1972 is a causative agent of Neotropical Echinococcosis, a chronic zoonotic disease which is endemic to the Neotropical region. This parasite is transmitted from bush dogs (Speothos venaticus) to their prey, which include lowland pacas (Cuniculus paca) and agoutis (Dasyprocta spp.). In Brazil, most human cases of Neotropical Echinococcosis have been recorded in the Amazonian states of Acre and Para, although few data are available on the occurrence of the potential definitive or intermediate hosts of E. vogeli in the Amazon region. In the present study, we surveyed the forests surrounding 46 human communities located within and around of outside six sustainable-use protected areas in the southwestern Amazon basin of Brazil. The forests were surveyed using camera traps to determine the local presence of potential wild hosts of E. vogeli, and the exploitation of these hosts for game meat was evaluated through interviews with 136 subsistence hunters resident in the local communities. We recorded pacas, agoutis, and bush dogs, as well as domestic dogs (Canis familiaris), all potential reservoirs of Neotropical Echinococcosis, using the same habitats. We also confirmed the frequent consumption of paca and agouti meat by subsistence hunters and their families in the study communities. Our data contribute to the understanding of the occurrence of E. vogeli in Brazilian ecosystems.

TI  - Land management impacts on tree hole invertebrate communities in a Neotropical rainforest
T2  - JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION
AB  - The Los Tuxtlas Biosphere Reserve in Southeastern Veracruz, Mexico represents the northernmost Neotropical lowland rainforest and has lost 84 % of its forests in the last forty years. Rich terrestrial and aquatic species communities are found throughout Neotropical forests, habitats increasingly threatened by land management practices. Plant-held waters, phytotelmata, are ecologically important discrete microhabitats harboring many specialist invertebrates and are abundant in tropical forests. In this study, using artificial tree holes, we examined invertebrate tree hole communities in a mature forest of Los Tuxtlas and in a managed habitat adjacent to the Los Tuxtlas Biological Station. Based on the proximity of human and livestock communities to managed habitats and the dispersal limitations of some phytotelmata specialists, we expected to find community composition differences between the two habitats. We found distinct differences in chironomid colonization; Tanypodinae, a predaceous subfamily, was present in the managed habitat and its omnivorous counterpart, Chironominae, was present in the forest. We found differences in mosquito colonization with more predaceous Toxorhychites in the managed habitat. Haemagogus mosquitoes were only present in the managed habitat. These results indicate different colonization ability across phytotelmata specialists and warn of larger community shifts and potential public health hazards with continued and intensified forest fragmentation and degradation.

TI  - Knowledge, Attitude, and Practices regarding Leptospirosis among Visitors to a Recreational Forest in Malaysia
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease and a worldwide public health problem that affects mainly high-risk groups. Characterizing knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) among high-risk groups is important to develop appropriate prevention programs. Here, we performed a cross-sectional study among 300 visitors of a recreational forest in Malaysia to examine leptospirosis KAP and demographics. These variables were integrated to create knowledge and practice scores for each respondent. All respondents had heard about leptospirosis, and 87% of them correctly identified it as a disease. The majority of respondents had high knowledge (63%), positive attitude, and good practice (68%) toward prevention of the disease. However, there were gaps in knowledge, with 78% of the respondents indicating eating without washing hands as the major cause of leptospirosis transmission. Our final model identified that higher knowledge score was associated with higher practice score. Our results indicate that it is important to increase knowledge, especially on transmission routes of leptospirosis, among visitors in recreational areas. Moreover, more attention needs to be paid to promote good practice habits among visitors, targeting those at higher risk of being infected by leptospirosis to prevent potential outbreaks in the recreational areas.

TI  - Assessing machine learning techniques for detailing soil map in the semiarid tropical region
T2  - 1ST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SUSTAINABLE TROPICAL LAND MANAGEMENT
CP  - 1st International Conference on Sustainable Tropical Land Management (ICSTLM)
AB  - The major problem detailing soil map in large tropical country such as Indonesia is high cost and time-consuming. The machine learning technique is one of DSM methodologies that explores spatial patterns to predict soil class and soil attribute. K-nearest neighbours (KNN), random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) are popular for detailing soil map in temperate country, but it is still rare to be applied in a tropical country. This study aimed to asses three machine learning in updating soil map from 1:50,000 to 1:25,000 scale in the semiarid tropical region. The existing soil map was collated and then derived environmental covariates representing soil-forming factors from the digital elevation model. There were 72 training datasets were originating from polygon soil maps used as input for these machine learning to recognize the pattern and predict soil class map in Bikomi Utara Sub District, Timor Tengah Utara Regency, Indonesia. Overall accuracy and kappa coefficient by KNN for the best three predictive soil maps were 74-75% and 0.62-0.63, respectively; and followed by SVM, 71-73% and 0.58-0.60; and the last RF, 69-75% and 0.55-0.63. This research revealed that machine learning of the KNN is potentially for updating soil map in a tropical semiarid area.

TI  - The body temperature of active amphibians along a tropical elevation gradient: patterns of mean and variance and inference from environmental data
T2  - FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY
AB  - Tropical montane amphibians have been the focus of recent and crucial conservation efforts. These initiatives require understanding on how elevation influences amphibian body temperature beyond the simplistic assumption of a monotonical decrease with elevation. This study addresses patterns and potential for inference in this context.
   As elevation increases, mean body temperature (BT) of tropical montane amphibians decreases linearly, but intrapopulation variation (VAR) in BT increases exponentially. These relationships are influenced by biome structure, but display both local nuances and species-specific remarks.
   Substrate temperature (ST) and BT hold a close relationship across elevation. The noise around this relationship is lowest in mid-elevation cloud forests and maximum in the paramo, a biome above the tree line.
   The relationships between BT and ST, and between elevation and either BT or VAR, are valuable to infer general patterns of thermal ecology for amphibians and to highlight species-specific exceptional cases.
   The BT of montane tropical amphibians can be estimated from temperature data collected at a scale compatible with the size and microhabitat of individual frogs. Estimates from elevation are valid as general trends that can be enhanced if natural history is taken into account. Worldclim data allow for rough inference only and have limited predictive power.
   A framework is proposed to study how the BT and VAR of amphibians change with elevation. This framework encompasses information on biome structure and natural history.

TI  - Modeling Carbon Emissions of Post-Selective Logging in the Production Forests of Ulu Jelai, Pahang, Malaysia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Harvested timber and constructed infrastructure over the logging area leave massive damage that contributes to the emission of anthropogenic gases into the atmosphere. Carbon emissions from tropical deforestation and forest degradation are the second largest source of anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases. Even though the emissions vary from region to region, a significant amount of carbon emissions comes mostly from timber harvesting, which is tightly linked to the selective logging intensity. This study intended to utilize a remote sensing approach to quantify carbon emissions from selective logging activities in Ulu Jelai Forest Reserve, Pahang, Malaysia. To quantify the emissions, the relevant variables from the logging's impact were identified as a predictor in the model development and were listed as stump height, stump diameter, cross-sectional area, timber volume, logging gaps, road, skid trails, and incidental damage resulting from the logging process. The predictive performance of linear regression and machine learning models, namely support vector machine (SVM), random forest, and K-nearest neighbor, were examined to assess the carbon emission from this degraded forest. To test the different methods, a combination of ground inventory plots, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), and satellite imagery were analyzed, and the performance in terms of root mean square error (RMSE), bias, and coefficient of correlation (R-2) were calculated. Among the four models tested, the machine learning model SVM provided the best accuracy with an RMSE of 21.10% and a bias of 0.23% with an adjusted R-2 of 0.80. Meanwhile, the linear model performed second with an RMSE of 22.14%, a bias of 0.72%, and an adjusted R-2 of 0.75. This study demonstrates the efficacy of remotely sensed data to facilitate the conventional methods of quantifying carbon emissions from selective logging and promoting advanced assessments that are more effective, especially in massive logging areas and various forest conditions. Findings from this research will be useful in assisting the relevant authorities in optimizing logging practices to sustain forest carbon sequestration for climate change mitigation.

TI  - Spatial and seasonal variation of avian malaria infections in five different land use types within a Neotropical montane forest matrix
T2  - LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
AB  - Seasonality as well as habitat destruction can alter host-parasite interactions. The montane cloud forest of Veracruz State in Mexico has been transformed into agro-ecosystems and cities. The aim of this study was to determine how ecological parameters of avian malaria parasites responded to five different land use types (i.e., well-preserved cloud forest, periurban forest, urban forest, coffee plantation, and cattle field) and to seasonality. We used microscopy and PCR methods to determine prevalence, parasitaemia, and aggregation of haemosporidians infecting the widespread chestnut-capped brush finch (Arremon brunneinucha). We performed PCA and cluster analyses to determine vegetation structure and similarity, and to investigate how relevant vegetation variables are associated with parasitological parameters. All haemosporidian infections in chestnut-capped brush finches belonged to Haemoproteus and Plasmodium species. Prevalence and parasitaemia of avian malaria were higher during the rainy season, while aggregation remained similar. Both prevalence and parasitaemia were higher in the urban forest. Prevalence was lower in the well-preserved cloud forest during the dry season. Parasitaemia was negatively associated to bush cover. Our results suggest that an increase in land use intensity reduces seasonal fluctuations in parasite transmission, and that infections are more frequent and more severe for birdsinhabiting urban environments.

TI  - Estimating feature extraction changes of Berkelah Forest, Malaysia from multisensor remote sensing data using and object-based technique
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
AB  - The study involves an object-based segmentation method to extract feature changes in tropical rainforest cover using Landsat image and airborne LiDAR (ALS). Disturbance event that are represents the changes are examined by the classification of multisensor data; that is a highly accurate ALS with different resolutions of multispectral Landsat image. Disturbance Index (DI) derived from Tasseled Cap Transformation, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and the ALS height are the variables for object-based segmentation process. The classification is categorized into two classes; disturbed and non-disturbed forest cover using Nearest Neighbor (NN), Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The overall accuracy ranging from 88% to 96% and kappa ranging from 0.79 to 0.91. Mcnemar's test p-value (<0.05) is applied to check the classification for each method used which is RF 0.03 and SVM 0.01. The accuracy increases when the integration of ALS in Landsat image (Spectral(Landsat); and Spectral(Landsat) + Height(ALS)).

TI  - Impact of selective logging on genetic composition and demographic structure of four tropical tree species
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Over-exploitation and fragmentation are serious problems for tropical forests. Most sustainable forest management practices avoid clear-cuts and apply selective logging systems focused on a few commercial species. We applied a simulation model to estimate the impact of such selective logging scenarios on the genetic diversity and demography of four tropical tree species from French Guiana. The simulations used data on genetic and demographic composition, growth, phenology and pollen and seed dispersal obtained for Dicorynia guianensis, Sextonia rubra, Symphonia globulifera and Vouacapoua americana at the experimental site in Paracou. Whereas Symphonia globulifera serves as a model for a species with low logging pressure, the other three species represent the most exploited tree species in French Guiana. In simulations with moderate logging, typical for French Guiana, with large cutting diameter (> 60 cm diameter) and long cutting cycles (65 years), the two species V. americana and Sextonia rubra were not able to recover their initial stock at the end of the rotation period, with a large decrease in the number of individuals and in basal area. Under a more intensive logging system (cutting diameter > 45 cm diameter, cutting cycles of 30 years) that is common practice in the Brazilian Amazon, only Symphonia globulifera showed no negative impact. Generally, the differences between the genetic parameters in the control scenarios without logging and the logging scenarios were surprisingly small. The main reasons for this were the overlapping of generations and the effective dispersal ability of gene vectors in all species, which guarantee relative homogeneity of the genetic structure in different age classes. Nevertheless, decreasing the population size by logging reduced the number of genotypes and caused higher genetic distances between the original population and the population at the end of the logging cycles. Sensitivity analysis showed that genetic changes in the logging scenarios were principally determined by the growth, densities and cutting diameter of each species, and only to a very small extent by the reproductive system including factors such as pollen and seed dispersal and flowering phenology.

TI  - Evaluating resampled and fused Sentinel-2 data and machine-learning algorithms for mangrove mapping in the northern coast of Qeshm island, Iran
T2  - NATURE CONSERVATION-BULGARIA
AB  - Mangrove forests, as an essential component of the coastal zones in tropical and subtropical areas, provide a wide range of goods and ecosystem services that play a vital role in ecology. Mangroves are globally threatened, disappearing, and degraded. Consequently, knowledge on mangroves distribution and change is important for effective conservation and making protection policies. Developing remote sensing data and classification methods have proven to be suitable tools for mapping mangrove forests over a regional scale. Here, we scrutinized and compared the performance of pixel-based and object-based methods under Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms in mapping a mangrove ecosystem into four main classes (Mangrove tree, mudflat, water, and sand spit) using resampled and fused Senti-nel-2 images. Additionally, landscape metrics were used to identify the differences between spatial patterns obtained from different classification methods. Results showed that pixel-based classifications were influ-enced heavily by the effect of salt and pepper noise, whereas in object-based classifications, boundaries of land use land cover (LULC) polygons were smoother and visually more appealing. Object-based clas-sifications, with an excellent level of kappa, distinguished mudflat and sand spit from each other and from mangrove better than the pixel-based classifications which obtained a fair-to-good level of kappa. RF and SVM performed differently under comparable circumstances. The results of landscape metrics comparison presented that the classification methods can be affected on quantifying area and size metrics. Although the results supported the idea that fused Sentinel images may provide better results in mangrove LULC classification, further research needs to develop and evaluate various image fusion approaches to make use of all Sentinel's fine resolution images. Our results on the mapping of mangrove ecosystems can contribute to the improvement of management and conservation strategies for these ecosystems being impacted by human activities.

TI  - Consequences of Seed Dispersal for Plant Recruitment in Tropical Forests: Interactions Within the Seedscape
T2  - BIOTROPICA
AB  - Seed dispersal sets the stage for the suite of biotic and abiotic interactions that determine the fate of individual seeds. In this review, we first focus on how dispersal influences the seedscape', or the combination of abiotic and biotic factors that affect the probability of recruitment once a seed has reached its final location. We review recent papers that examine the effect of different dispersal vectors on (1) the quality of the habitat in which a seed lands; (2) the distance seeds are dispersed from the parent tree; and (3) the density and composition of plants within the neighborhood of a seed following deposition. Next, we explore methods used to scale these processes up to the level of populations. We highlight demographic models that integrate across multiple life history stages and predict the impact of dispersal in variable environments on population growth. We also review studies that analyze existing spatial patterns of trees within large forest plots and use various strategies to infer the processes that led to those patterns. We continue to scale up from populations to communities, and discuss approaches that have been taken to understand how dispersal may affect diversity and abundance in the community. We then turn to human disturbances and discuss the implications of frugivore defaunation for plant communities. We finish by highlighting several areas of research that are particularly promising for future directions of study.

TI  - Occurrence of anti-<i>Leptospira</i> spp. antibodies in <i>Rhipidomys</i> spp. from a forest fragment of the Brazilian Cerrado
T2  - TROPICAL ANIMAL HEALTH AND PRODUCTION
AB  - Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease of world importance, and its transmission depends on the interaction between humans and animals. Given the necessity to investigate potential hosts of Leptospira spp., this study verified the prevalence of different serovars in the species of Rhipidomys spp., a widespread sigmodont rodent in Brazil. The studied population originates from a semi-evergreen forest located in the county of UberlA cent ndia, in the state of Minas Gerais. The microscopic agglutination test (MAT) was performed with 14 serovars. Thirteen out of the 43 wild rodents captured showed a positive agglutination reaction, with a greater prevalence of the serovars Pyrogenes, Copenhageni, and Canicola. This study found a prevalence of 30.3% anti-Leptospira spp. antibodies; all positive animals were reactive to more than one serovar.

TI  - An ecoregional classification for the state of Roraima, Brazil.: The importance of landscape in malaria biology
T2  - MEMORIAS DO INSTITUTO OSWALDO CRUZ
AB  - Understanding the different background landscapes in which malaria transmission occurs is fundamental to understanding malaria epidemiology and to designing effective local malaria control programs. Geology, geomorphology, vegetation, climate, land use, and anopheline distribution were used as a basis for an ecological classification of the state of Roraima, Brazil, in the northern Amazon Basin, focused on the natural history of malaria and transmission. We used unsupervised maximum likelihood classification, principal components analysis, and weighted overlay with equal contribution analyses to fine-scale thematic maps that resulted in clustered regions. We used ecological niche modeling techniques to develop a fine-scale picture of malaria vector distributions in the state. Eight ecoregions were identified and malaria-related aspects are discussed based on this classification, including 5 types of dense tropical rain forest and 3 types of savannah. Ecoregions formed by dense tropical rain forest were named as montane (ecoregion I), submontane (II), plateau (III), lowland (IV), and alluvial ( V). Ecoregions formed by savannah were divided into steppe ( VI, campos de Roraima), savannah (VII, cerrado), and wetland (VIII, campinarana). Such ecoregional mappings are important tools in integrated malaria control programs that aim to identify specific characteristics of malaria transmission, classify transmission risk, and define priority areas and appropriate interventions. For some areas, extension of these approaches to still-finer resolutions will provide an improved picture of malaria transmission patterns.

TI  - Estimation of Forest Above-Ground Biomass by Geographically Weighted Regression and Machine Learning with Sentinel Imagery
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Accurate forest above-ground biomass (AGB) is crucial for sustaining forest management and mitigating climate change to support REDD+ (reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, plus the sustainable management of forests, and the conservation and enhancement of forest carbon stocks) processes. Recently launched Sentinel imagery offers a new opportunity for forest AGB mapping and monitoring. In this study, texture characteristics and backscatter coefficients of Sentinel-1, in addition to multispectral bands, vegetation indices, and biophysical variables of Sentinal-2, based on 56 measured AGB samples in the center of the Changbai Mountains, China, were used to develop biomass prediction models through geographically weighted regression (GWR) and machine learning (ML) algorithms, such as the artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine for regression (SVR), and random forest (RF). The results showed that texture characteristics and vegetation biophysical variables were the most important predictors. SVR was the best method for predicting and mapping the patterns of AGB in the study site with limited samples, whose mean error, mean absolute error, root mean square error, and correlation coefficient were 4 x 10(-3), 0.07, 0.08 Mgha(-1), and 1, respectively. Predicted values of AGB from four models ranged from 11.80 to 324.12 Mgha(-1), and those for broadleaved deciduous forests were the most accurate, while those for AGB above 160 Mgha(-1) were the least accurate. The study demonstrated encouraging results in forest AGB mapping of the normal vegetated area using the freely accessible and high-resolution Sentinel imagery, based on ML techniques.

TI  - Long-Tailed Macaques (<i>Macaca fascicularis</i>) in Urban Landscapes: Gastrointestinal Parasitism and Barriers for Healthy Coexistence in Northeast Thailand
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Gastrointestinal parasites have diverse life cycles that can involve people, animals, and the environment (e.g., water and soil), demonstrating the utility of One Health frameworks in characterizing infection risk. Kosumpee Forest Park (Thailand) is home to a dense population of long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis) that frequently interact with tourists and local residents. Our study investigated the presence of zoonotic parasites, and barriers to healthy coexistence by conducting stool analysis on macaques (N=102) and people (N=115), and by examining risk factors for infection with a household questionnaire (N=95). Overall, 44% of macaques and 12% of people were infected with one or more gastrointestinal helminths, including Strongyloides spp., Ascaris spp., and Trichuris sp. An adults-only generalized linear mixed model identified three factors significantly associated with human infection: household size, occupational exposure, and contact with macaque feces at home. Participants identified both advantages and disadvantages to living in close contact with macaques, suggesting that interventions to improve human and animal health in Kosumpee Forest Park would be welcome.

TI  - Habitat split as a driver of disease in amphibians
T2  - BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS
AB  - Anthropogenic habitat disturbance is fundamentally altering patterns of disease transmission and immunity across the vertebrate tree of life. Most studies linking anthropogenic habitat change and disease focus on habitat loss and fragmentation, but these processes often lead to a third process that is equally important: habitat split. Defined as spatial separation between the multiple classes of natural habitat that many vertebrate species require to complete their life cycles, habitat split has been linked to population declines in vertebrates, e.g. amphibians breeding in lowland aquatic habitats and overwintering in fragments of upland terrestrial vegetation. Here, we link habitat split to enhanced disease risk in amphibians (i) by reviewing the biotic and abiotic forces shaping elements of immunity and (ii) through a spatially oriented field study focused on tropical frogs. We propose a framework to investigate mechanisms by which habitat split influences disease risk in amphibians, focusing on three broad host factors linked to immunity: (i) composition of symbiotic microbial communities, (ii) immunogenetic variation, and (iii) stress hormone levels. Our review highlights the potential for habitat split to contribute to host-associated microbiome dysbiosis, reductions in immunogenetic repertoire, and chronic stress, that often facilitate pathogenic infections and disease in amphibians and other classes of vertebrates. We highlight that targeted habitat-restoration strategies aiming to connect multiple classes of natural habitats (e.g. terrestrial-freshwater, terrestrial-marine, marine-freshwater) could enhance priming of the vertebrate immune system through repeated low-load exposure to enzootic pathogens and reduced stress-induced immunosuppression.

TI  - Chronic anthropogenic disturbance on Caatinga dry forest fragments
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - Understanding how chronic anthropogenic disturbances are distributed in space leads to more effective conservation and management practices. This study provides a large-scale overview of how the Caatinga dry forest is potentially altered by chronic anthropogenic disturbance. In particular, we investigate how the intensity of the potential disturbance varies (a) among geographic regions, (b) among fragment sizes, and (c) as a function of distance to the fragment edge. A chronic anthropogenic disturbance index (CDI) was derived to represent five anthropogenic disturbance vectors: human population, infrastructure, grazing, logging and fire. CDI was spatialized for the whole Caatinga landscape (826,411 km(2)) and posteriorly averaged forc. 47,100 remaining fragments. Chronic anthropogenic disturbance was unevenly distributed across the Caatinga landscape, with more conserved sites on the western and southern regions. Larger fragments were, on average, as disturbed as smaller ones. However, smaller fragments varied from highly disturbed to very well preserved depending on the regional context. Strong edge effects were recognized for the CDI and its five vectors. Policy implications. Although half of the original Caatinga vegetation remains, most remaining fragments probably suffer with chronic anthropogenic disturbances. This suggests that a large portion of the Caatinga can be currently threatened, and its biodiversity and natural resources eroded by processes that are less evident than habitat loss. Proper management practices and expansion of the existing protected area network are needed to halt the Caatinga biodiversity decline. Conservation and management actions in tropical ecosystems seem to be more urgent than previously assumed.

TI  - Changes in Physicochemical Properties and Bacterial Communities of Tropical Soil in China under Different Soil Utilization Types
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
AB  - The primary purpose of our study is to clarify the differences in physicochemical properties and microbial community composition with the continuous evolution of soil utilization types. Here, we used natural forest soil (NS), healthy banana garden soil (HS), diseased banana garden soil (DS), and paddy soil (PS) in tropical areas of Hainan Province to conduct this study. According to our research, the abundance and diversity of soil bacteria (HS/DS and PS) decrease significantly as soil utilization types evolve. In healthy banana soil, the amount of Actinobacteria and Firmicutes at the bacterial phylum level is more significant than in other soil utilization types. It was observed that the bacterial community structure in NS was notably distinct from that in HS and PS. Apart from paddy soil, the bacterial makeup of the other two soil utilization types mainly remained consistent. Pathogenic soil (DS) undergoes significant changes in its chemical properties. These changes are primarily seen as decreased pH and organic carbon content and increased C/N and inorganic nitrogen content (NH4+, NO3-). This suggests that a specific type of microorganism (Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense) can cause a significant shift in the soil environment, leading to an unexpected change in soil type. Therefore, to ensure that the soil is healthy, we must balance the soil microbial community composition, promote the increase of the beneficial microbial species and quantity, and create an environment suitable for microbial growth.

TI  - Prehospital Emergencies in Illegal Gold Mining Sites in French Guiana
T2  - WILDERNESS & ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICINE
AB  - Introduction-Illegal gold mining is flourishing in French Guiana, existing outside the law due to both the high cost of gold mining permits and the challenges of law enforcement within the Amazon forest. We report the characteristics of, and the medical responses to, medical emergencies in illegal gold mining sites.
   Methods-We performed a retrospective study of all medical emergencies reported from illegal gold mining sites to the centralized call office of SAMU 973 from 1998 through 2000 and from 2008 through 2010. According to the national health care system, any medical emergency within the territory is handled by the prehospital emergency medical service (SAMU 973), irrespective of the patients' legal status. Data were extracted from the SAMU 973 notebook registry (1998-2000) or the SAMU 973 computerized database (2008-2010) and werre collected using a standardized questionnaire.
   Results-Of 71,932 calls for medical emergencies in French Guiana during the study periods, 340 (0.5%) originated from illegal gold mining sites. Of these, 196 (58%) led to medical evacuation by helicopter, whereas the overall rate of evacuation by helicopter after placing a call to SAMU 973 was only 4% (3020/71,932; P < 0.0001 for comparison with illegal gold mining sites). Medical emergencies were classified as illness (48%, mostly infectious), trauma (44%, mostly weapon wounds), and miscellaneous (8%).
   Conclusions-Medical emergencies at illegal gold mining sites in the Amazon forest mostly include infectious diseases, followed by trauma, and often require medical evacuation by helicopter. Our study suggests that implementation of preventive medicine within gold mining sites, irrespective of their legal status, could be cost-effective and reduce morbidity.

TI  - Determinants of phytolith occluded carbon in bamboo stands across forest types in the eastern Indian Himalayas
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Phytoliths are known to play a significant role in the global carbon cycle by sequestering atmospheric carbon dioxide as phytolith-occluded carbon (PhytOC) for a long time. Given the resistant nature of phytolith to decomposition, PhytOC can represent up to 82 % of total carbon in some soil and sediments even after 2000 years of litter decompo-sition. Hence, forests with high PhytOC sequestration rates could play a critical role in increasing terrestrial carbon storage. In this study, we quantified the variation in PhytOC concentrations in bamboo leaves, branches and culms with forest types in the Eastern Indian Himalayas as bamboos are efficient accumulator of phytolith and PhytOC due to their fast growth and high biomass accumulation rates. Using nine different machine learning techniques, we also investigated the determinants of PhytOC production in bamboo stands in the study area in India. The results re-vealed that the PhytOC concentrations in bamboo stands were in the order of leaf (3.0 g kg-1) > culm (1.0 g kg-1) > branch (0.2 g kg-1) across forest types. The highest PhytOC stock (53.8 kg ha-1) was found in bamboo stands in the subtropical pine forests (1900-3500 m elevation), while the lowest (28.0 kg ha-1) was in the tropical evergreen forests (<900 m elevation). Machine learning techniques established a positive correlation of PhytOC content in leaf and total PhytOC content with soil available phosphorus, elevation, total nitrogen, exchangeable potassium, atmo-spheric humidity, SOC content, CEC and pH. Numerical evaluation criteria and graphic methods identified artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector regression as the superior techniques with a root mean square error value of 0.52 kg ha-1 and 0.59 kg ha-1 respectively. The results of these two models were found to be better among all the nine machine learning algorithms used. The high PhytOC storage in the bamboo stands in the Indian Himalayan region suggests that forest management could secure a stable carbon sink on a millennial scale.

TI  - Solution for worn-out tires, gully erosions, forests and dengue fever in Brazil
T2  - LANDBAUFORSCHUNG VOLKENRODE
AB  - Rehabilitation of large gully erosions was improved in Piracicaba (Brazil) by using worn-out tires. Two procedures were evaluated in different case studies, the "ditch technique" (DT) and the "fill-up technique" (FT). In both, worn-out tires were placed at the bottom of the gullies, covered (naturally or artificially) with soil and reforested. In the DT the tires were placed in small pyramidal barriers perpendicular to the gully along its bottom and in the FT they were used as filling material occupying the lower part of the whole gully. The benefits of the suggested methods are an adequate disposal of worn-out tires, restoration of forest resources and the control of the mosquito species Aedes aegypti, whose larvae develop extremely well in the clean water accumulated in open-air stored tires. This mosquito species is vector of the tropical epidemic disease dengue fever. The paper reports on two case studies substantiating the practicability of the methods. The multiple advantages and the need of none or little capital investments for the adoption of the technologies contribute for its acceptance by decision makers, politicians and society.

TI  - Understanding the drivers of Southeast Asian biodiversity loss
T2  - ECOSPHERE
AB  - Southeast Asia (SE Asia) is a known global hotspot of biodiversity and endemism, yet the region is also one of the most biotically threatened. Ecosystems across the region are threatened by an array of drivers, each of which increases the probability of extinction of species in a variety of ecosystems. These issues are symptomatic of the issues that face the global tropics; however, with around 4 billion people in the wider region and the associated pressures on biodiversity, this region may be under some of the greatest levels of biotic threat. Deforestation rates in SE Asia are some of the highest globally, additionally it has the highest rate of mining in the tropics, around the greatest number of hydropower dams under construction, and a consumption of species for traditional medicines which is a threat to biodiversity globally. In this review, the greatest threats to regional biodiversity in the SE Asian region are discussed. Tree-plantations and deforestation represent one of the most imminent threats, and some countries have already lost over half their original forest cover (i.e., the Philippines, parts of Indonesia), with projections of as much as 98% loss for some regions in the coming decade. Hunting and trade represent a significant threat as demand stems not only for food, but also for medicine, for ornamentation, and as a status symbol. Mining represents a frequently overlooked threat, as the Asian region is one of the greatest exporters of limestone and various minerals globally, and the cost of this to biodiversity is not only through the direct loss of areas for mines, but also through the development of roads that further fragment the landscape, the leakage of heavy metals, and the destruction of limestone karsts, which represent global endemicity hotspots. Reservoir construction, wetland drainage, fires, pollution, invasive species, disease, and finally climate change are also considered. Once each issue has been discussed, the overall prognosis of regional biodiversity and priority actions to protect SE Asian biodiversity in the future is discussed.

TI  - Inter-Annual Climate Variability Impact on Oil Palm Mapping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - The contribution of oil palm plantations to the economic growth of tropical developing countries makes it essential to monitor their expansion into the tropical forest; consequently, most studies focus on improving mapping accuracy while using satellite imagery. However, accuracy can be hampered by atmospheric phenomena that can drastically change climatic conditions in tropical regions, affecting the spectral properties of the vegetation. In this sense, we studied the accuracy of palm plantation mapping by using features from different regions of the electromagnetic spectrum and a data fusion approach, and then compared the changes in accuracy over the years 2016, 2017, and 2018 (two of them with reported climatic anomalies). Optical-based maps obtained higher accuracy than thermal- and microwave-based maps, but they were the most affected by inter-annual climate variability (error margin between 5 and 10%), while thermal-based maps were the least affected (error margin between 8 and 9%). Data fusion combinations improved accuracy and reduced dissimilarities between years (e.g., phenology-based map accuracy changed by up to 20.8%, while phenology fused with microwave features changed by up to 6.8%). We conclude that inter-annual climate variability on land-cover mapping should be considered, especially if the outputs will be used as input in future studies.

TI  - Global and local environmental changes as drivers of Buruli ulcer emergence
T2  - EMERGING MICROBES & INFECTIONS
AB  - Many emerging infectious diseases are caused by generalist pathogens that infect and transmit via multiple host species with multiple dissemination routes, thus confounding the understanding of pathogen transmission pathways from wildlife reservoirs to humans. The emergence of these pathogens in human populations has frequently been associated with global changes, such as socio-economic, climate or biodiversity modifications, by allowing generalist pathogens to invade and persist in new ecological niches, infect new host species, and thus change the nature of transmission pathways. Using the case of Buruli ulcer disease, we review how land-use changes, climatic patterns and biodiversity alterations contribute to disease emergence in many parts of the world. Here we clearly show that Mycobacterium ulcerans is an environmental pathogen characterized by multi-host transmission dynamics and that its infectious pathways to humans rely on the local effects of global environmental changes. We show that the interplay between habitat changes (for example, deforestation and agricultural land-use changes) and climatic patterns (for example, rainfall events), applied in a local context, can lead to abiotic environmental changes and functional changes in local biodiversity that favor the pathogen's prevalence in the environment and may explain disease emergence.

TI  - Host specificity of pathogenic <i>Pythium</i> species:: Implications for tree species diversity
T2  - BIOTROPICA
AB  - In the Janzen-Connell hypothesis, host-specific natural enemies enhance species diversity and influence the structure of plant communities. This study tests the explicit assumption of host specificity for soil pathogens of the genus Pythium that cause damping-off disease of germinating seeds and seedlings. We isolated Pythium spp. from soil of a tropical forest in Panama. Then, in an inoculation experiment, we determined the pathogenicity of 75 tropical isolates of unknown pathogenicity and seven pathogenic temperate isolates of Pythium on seeds and/or seedlings of eight tropical tree species. Only three tropical isolates, one identified as P. ultimum and two as P. aphanidermatum, were pathogenic. Tropical pathogenic isolates were pathogenic on 4-6 of eight tree species. Temperate isolates were pathogenic on 0-4 of eight species, indicating that some tropical tree species are susceptible to novel isolates of Pythium. No tree species was susceptible to all isolates and two species were not susceptible to any isolate. Collectively, these results indicate that these Pythium isolates vary widely in their pathogenicity, causing differential mortality of potential host species; likewise, the tree species vary in their susceptibility to a given Pythium isolate. These differences in pathogenicity and susceptibility indicate some support for the Janzen-Connell assumption of host specificity. While they are not restricted to a single species, their intermediate level of specificity suggests that Pythium spp. have the potential to have some effect on forest community structure and diversity.

TI  - Application of multidimensional structural characterization to detect and describe moderate forest disturbance
T2  - ECOSPHERE
AB  - The study of vegetation community and structural change has been central to ecology for over a century, yet the ways in which disturbances reshape the physical structure of forest canopies remain relatively unknown. Moderate severity disturbances affect different canopy strata and plant species, resulting in variable structural outcomes and ecological consequences. Terrestrial lidar (light detection and ranging) offers an unprecedented view of the interior arrangement and distribution of canopy elements, permitting the derivation of multidimensional measures of canopy structure that describe several canopy structural traits (CSTs) with known links to ecosystem function. We used lidar-derived CSTs within a machine learning framework to detect and describe the structural changes that result from various disturbance agents, including moderate severity fire, ice storm damage, age-related senescence, hemlock woolly adelgid, beech bark disease, and chronic acidification. We found that fire and ice storms primarily affected the amount and position of vegetation within canopies, while acidification, senescence, pathogen, and insect infestation altered canopy arrangement and complexity. Only two of the six disturbance agents significantly reduced leaf area, counter to common assumptions regarding many moderate severity disturbances. While findings are limited in their generalizability due to lack of replication among disturbances, they do suggest that the current limitations of standard disturbance detection methods-such as optical-based remote sensing platforms, which are often above-canopy perspectives-limit our ability to understand the full ecological and structural impacts of disturbance, and to evaluate the consistency of structural patterns within and among disturbance agents. A more broadly inclusive definition of ecological disturbance that incorporates multiple aspects of canopy structural change may potentially improve the modeling, detection, and prediction of functional implications of moderate severity disturbance as well as broaden our understanding of the ecological impacts of disturbance.

TI  - <i>Observation of parasitism by flies</i> (Philornis bellus) <i>in three hummingbird species from Western Mexico</i>
T2  - REVISTA MEXICANA DE BIODIVERSIDAD
AB  - Both biotic and abiotic factors have been highlighted as negative for nesting success in birds, including predation, natural phenomena and emerging diseases. However, birds are also susceptible to endo- and ectoparasites. Diptera are the most common parasites, being families as Calliphoridae, Muscidae and Piophilidae the more reported as bird parasites. The genus Philornis (Muscidae) is closely related to birds, causing a negative impact on nestlings and their development. In hummingbirds the presence of Philornis has been reported in nestlings of Glaucis hirsuta, Thalurania glaucopis and Eupetomena macroura. In this study, we recorded the presence of Philornis bellus in nestlings of Amazilia rutila, Cynanthus latirostris, and Chlorostilbon auriceps in a tropical dry forest. Cynanthus latirostris presented the highest larvae number and A. rutila the lowest. Although it has been affirmed that more than 7 larvae are lethal for birds, it is necessary to conduct experimental studies and to consider a systematic monitoring of nests to determine the population-level effects of these parasites.

TI  - Sediment-driven plastisphere community assembly on plastic debris in tropical coastal and marine environments
T2  - ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
AB  - Coastal habitats have been suggested to serve as a sink for unaccounted plastic debris, i.e., "missing plastic" in the sea, and hence, a hotspot of plastic pollution in the marine and coastal environments. Although the accumulation of plastic debris may pose significant threats to coastal ecosystems, we know little about the fate of these plastic debris and their ecological impacts due to the lack of studies on plastic-microbe interactions in coastal habitats, especially for the tropical marine and coastal environments. In this study, we collected plastic debris from 14 sites consisting of various coastal ecosystems (seagrass meadows, mangrove forests, and beaches), and marine ecosystem (coral reef) around Singapore and characterized the prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbial communities colonized on them. Our results showed that the composition of plastisphere communities in these intertidal ecosystems was predominantly influenced by the sediment than by the plastic materials. Compared with surrounding sediment and seawater, the plastic debris enriched potential plastic degraders, such as Muricauda, Halomonas, and Brevundimonas. The plastic debris was also found to host taxa that play significant roles in biogeochemical cycles (e.g., cyanobacteria, Erythrobacter), hygienically relevant bacteria (e.g., Chryseobacterium, Brevundimonas), and potential pathogens that may negatively impact the health of coastal ecosystems (e.g., Thraustochytriaceae, Labyrinthulaceae, Flavobacterium). Taken together, our study provides valuable insights into the plastic-microbe interactions in tropical coastal and marine ecosystems, highlighting the urgent need for plastisphere studies to understand the fate and ecological impacts of plastic debris accumulated in coastal habitats.

TI  - Seroepidemiologic survey of emerging vector-borne infections in South Korean forest/field workers
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Author summary With global warming and lush forest change, vector-borne infections are expected to increase in the number and diversity of agents. Since the first report of severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) in 2013, the number of reported cases has increased annually in South Korea. However, although tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) was detected from ticks and wild rodents, there is no human TBE case report in South Korea. This study aimed to determine the seroprevalence of TBEV and SFTS virus (SFTSV) among forest and field workers in South Korea. Among 583 forest/field workers, the seroprevalence of neutralizing antibodies against TBEV and SFTSV were 0.3% (2/583) and 0.2% (1/583), respectively. This study shows that it is necessary to raise the awareness of physicians about TBEV infection and to make efforts to survey and diagnose vector-borne diseases in South Korea.

This study aimed to determine the seroprevalence of TBEV and SFTS virus (SFTSV) among forest and field workers in South Korea. From January 2017 to August 2018, a total 583 sera were obtained from the forest and field workers in South Korea. IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and neutralization assay were conducted for TBEV, and indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and neutralization assay were performed for SFTSV. Seroprevalence of TBEV was 0.9% (5/583) by IgG ELISA, and 0.3% (2/583) by neutralization assay. Neutralizing antibody against TBEV was detected in a forest worker in Jeju (1:113) and Hongcheon (1:10). Only 1 (0.2%) forest worker in Yeongju was seropositive for SFTSV by IFA (1:2,048) and neutralizing antibody was detected also. In conclusion, this study shows that it is necessary to raise the awareness of physicians about TBEV infection and to make efforts to survey and diagnose vector-borne diseases in South Korea.

TI  - Influence of Urban Landscapes on Population Dynamics in a Short-Distance Migrant Mosquito: Evidence for the Dengue Vector <i>Aedes aegypti</i>
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background: Dengue viruses are endemic across most tropical and subtropical regions. Because no proven vaccines are available, dengue prevention is primarily accomplished through controlling the mosquito vector Aedes aegypti. While dispersal distance is generally believed to be,100 m, patterns of dispersion may vary in urban areas due to landscape features acting as barriers or corridors to dispersal. Anthropogenic features ultimately affect the flow of genes affecting vector competence and insecticide resistance. Therefore, a thorough understanding of what parameters impact dispersal is essential for efficient implementation of any mosquito population suppression program. Population replacement and genetic control strategies currently under consideration are also dependent upon a thorough understanding of mosquito dispersal in urban settings.
   Methodology and Principal Findings: We examined the effect of a major highway on dispersal patterns over a 2 year period. A. aegypti larvae were collected on the east and west sides of Uriah Butler Highway (UBH) to examine any effect UBH may have on the observed population structure in the Charlieville neighborhood in Trinidad, West Indies. A panel of nine microsatellites, two SNPs and a 710 bp sequence of mtDNA cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (CO1) were used for the molecular analyses of the samples. Three CO1 haplotypes were identified, one of which was only found on the east side of the road in 2006 and 2007. AMOVA using mtCO1 and nuclear markers revealed significant differentiation between the east- and west-side collections.
   Conclusion and Significance: Our results indicate that anthropogenic barriers to A. aegypti dispersal exist in urban environments and should be considered when implementing control programs during dengue outbreaks and population suppression or replacement programs.

TI  - Dense residential areas promote gene flow in dengue vector mosquito <i>Aedes albopictus</i>
T2  - ISCIENCE
AB  - Aedes albopictus is a successful disease vector due to its ability to survive in a wide range of habitats. Despite its ubiquity and impact on public health, little is known about its differential gene flow capabilities across different city habitats. We obtained a comprehensive dataset of >27,000 genome-wide DNA markers across 105 wild-caught Ae. albopictus individuals from Singapore, a dengue-endemic tropical city with heterogeneous landscapes from densely populated urban areas to forests. Despite Singapore's challenging small-scale heterogeneity, our landscape-genomic approach indicated that dense urban areas are characterized by higher Aedes gene flow rates than managed parks and forests. We documented the incidence of Wolbachia infections of Ae. albopictus involving two strains (wAlbA and wAlbB). Our results dispel the misconception that substantial dispersal of Ae. albopictus is limited to urban greenery, with wide implications for vector management and critical insights into urban planning strategies to combat dengue transmission.

TI  - <i>Loa loa</i> vectors <i>Chrysops</i> spp.: perspectives on research, distribution, bionomics, and implications for elimination of lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
AB  - Background: Loiasis is a filarial disease caused Loa loa. The main vectors are Chrysops silacea and C. dimidiata which are confined to the tropical rainforests of Central and West Africa. Loiasis is a mild disease, but individuals with high microfilaria loads may suffer from severe adverse events if treated with ivermectin during mass drug administration campaigns for the elimination of lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis. This poses significant challenges for elimination programmes and alternative interventions are required in L. loa co-endemic areas. The control of Chrysops has not been considered as a viable cost-effective intervention; we reviewed the current knowledge of Chrysops vectors to assess the potential for control as well as identified areas for future research.
   Results: We identified 89 primary published documents on the two main L. loa vectors C. silacea and C dimidiata. These were collated into a database summarising the publication, field and laboratory procedures, species distributions, ecology, habitats and methods of vector control. The majority of articles were from the 1950-1960s. Field studies conducted in Cameroon, Democratic Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Nigeria and Sudan highlighted that C. silacea is the most important and widespread vector. This species breeds in muddy streams or swampy areas of forests or plantations, descends from forest canopies to feed on humans during the day, is more readily adapted to human dwellings and attracted to wood fires. Main vector targeted measures proposed to impact on L. loa transmission included personal repellents, household screening, indoor residual spraying, community-based environmental management, adulticiding and larviciding.
   Conclusions: This is the first comprehensive review of the major L. loa vectors for several decades. It highlights key vector transmission characteristics that may be targeted for vector control providing insights into the potential for integrated vector management, with multiple diseases being targeted simultaneously, with shared human and financial resources and multiple impact. Integrated vector management programmes for filarial infections, especially in low transmission areas of onchocerciasis, require innovative approaches and alternative strategies if the elimination targets established by the World Health Organization are to be achieved.

TI  - Differing taxonomic responses of mosquito vectors to anthropogenic land-use change in Latin America and the Caribbean
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Anthropogenic land-use change, such as deforestation and urban development, can affect the emergence and re-emergence of mosquito-borne diseases, e.g., dengue and malaria, by creating more favourable vector habitats. There has been a limited assessment of how mosquito vectors respond to land-use changes, including differential species responses, and the dynamic nature of these responses. Improved understanding could help design effective disease control strategies. We compiled an extensive dataset of 10,244 Aedes and Anopheles mosquito abundance records across multiple land-use types at 632 sites in Latin America and the Caribbean. Using a Bayesian mixed effects modelling framework to account for between-study differences, we compared spatial differences in the abundance and species richness of mosquitoes across multiple land-use types, including agricultural and urban areas. Overall, we found that mosquito responses to anthropogenic land-use change were highly inconsistent, with pronounced responses observed at the genus- and species levels. There were strong declines in Aedes (-26%) and Anopheles (-35%) species richness in urban areas, however certain species such as Aedes aegypti, thrived in response to anthropogenic disturbance. When abundance records were coupled with remotely sensed forest loss data, we detected a strong positive response of dominant and secondary malaria vectors to recent deforestation. This highlights the importance of the temporal dynamics of land-use change in driving disease risk and the value of large synthetic datasets for understanding changing disease risk with environmental change.
   Author summaryAn understanding of the response of disease vectors to anthropogenic activities can aid in the control of mosquito-borne disease transmission. However, regional assessments of these responses are lacking, especially in areas where mosquito-borne diseases are emerging and re-emerging. We assembled a synthetic dataset of mosquito abundance and species richness across multiple land-use types in Latin America and the Caribbean, using data from peer-reviewed published studies. We then used this dataset to explore whether mosquito abundance and species richness changed, compared to a baseline of minimal anthropogenic activity, depending on the type of land use. Overall, we observed a decline in mosquito biodiversity in urban areas. We detected distinct species-specific responses in abundance to land use, with some important disease vectors, such as Aedes aegypti, increasing in abundance in anthropogenic environments. Finally, we also demonstrated by coupling our dataset with forest loss data that the abundance of dominant malaria vectors in the region increases with deforestation.

TI  - Invasive <i>Syzygium jambos</i> trees in Puerto Rico: no refuge from guava rust
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY
AB  - Biological invasions can have negative consequences for resident biota, particularly when disease-causing organisms are involved. Austropuccinia psidii, or guava rust, has rapidly spread through the tropics affecting both native and non-native Myrtaceae. In Puerto Rico, the rust has become common on Syzygium jambos, an invasive tree native to South-East Asia. What are the drivers of infection, and do refugia exist across a heterogeneous landscape? We address these questions using species distribution modelling and beta regressions. The realized and potential distribution of Syzygium jambos is extensive. The model produced an AUC of 0.88, with land-use categories and precipitation accounting for 61.1% of the variation. Predictability of S. jambos is highest in disturbed habitats, especially in mountainous regions with high precipitation. All 101 trees surveyed and measured across Puerto Rico showed signs of infection to varying extents. Infection severity was consistently associated with annual mean temperature in all top beta regression models, but was also commonly associated with tree size and precipitation variables. We found no safe sites for S. jambos. Many trees were extremely unhealthy and some were dead, suggesting that S. jambos may soon become extinct on the island or reduced to persistent stump sprouts. Native vegetation may benefit from the local demise of S. jambos. While the rust has not jumped to native Myrtaceae, vigilance is required, as host-shifts have occurred in other tropical regions.

TI  - Modeling Mosquitoes and their Potential Odonate Predators Under Different Land Uses
T2  - ECOHEALTH
AB  - To efficiently face the accelerated landscape transformation and its consequences in restructuring biotic communities and ecosystem services, one first question is which regional systems deserve prioritization for empirical assessments and interventive strategies. For the particular case of vector-borne disease control, we should consider generalist predators exhibiting differential responses to land-use change, as is the case of odonate insects. Thus, our aim was to infer land uses in Mexico where odonates (i.e., damselflies and dragonflies) might have some potential to predate mosquitoes of medical relevance. The study area included the hydrological basins of central Mexico. We modelled 167 species of odonates, four species of mosquitoes, and 51 land-use categories. Inferring spatial co-occurrence patterns from data mining and complex networks, we identified: (1) the ecological network of odonates and mosquitoes and (2) the land uses shared by these two groups. We inferred that 34% of odonate species co-occur with mosquitoes of medical relevance mainly in some preserved-mountain mesophyll cloud forest, high evergreen rainforest, and low tropical dry forest-but also in highly modified-human settlements, irrigation-based and pastures crop fields-land uses with strong human presence. Our findings highlight the relevance of community-regional studies for understanding the public health consequences of landscape change.

TI  - Integrating Airborne LiDAR and Optical Data to Estimate Forest Aboveground Biomass in Arid and Semi-Arid Regions of China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Forest Aboveground Biomass (AGB) is a key parameter for assessing forest productivity and global carbon content. In previous studies, AGB has been estimated using various prediction methods and types of remote sensing data. Increasingly, there is a trend towards integrating various data sources such as Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and optical data. In this study, we constructed and compared the accuracies of five models for estimating AGB of forests in the upper Heihe River Basin in Northwest China. The five models were constructed using field and remotely-sensed data (optical and LiDAR) and algorithms including Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Back Propagation Neural Networks (BPNN), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and the Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM). Models based on the RF algorithm emerged as being the best among the five algorithms irrespective of the datasets used. The Random Forest AGB model, using only LiDAR data (R-2 = 0.899, RMSE -14.0 t/ha) as the input data, was more effective than the one using optical data (R-2 = 0.835, RMSE = 22.724 t/ha). Compared to LiDAR or optical data alone, the AGB model (R-2 = 0.913, RMSE = 13.352 t/ha) that used the RF algorithm and integrated LiDAR and optical data was found to be optimal. Incorporation of terrain variables with optical data resulted in only slight improvements in accuracy. The models developed in this study could be useful for using integrated airborne LiDAR and passive optical data to accurately estimate forest biomass.

TI  - Geospatial modeling of forest cover dynamics and impact on climate variability in Awi Zone, Ethiopia
T2  - TROPICAL ECOLOGY
AB  - Globally, forest habitats are threatened by human-induced deforestation and degradation. This study was aimed to assessing changes in land-use patterns in Awi Zone, Ethiopia, during the last 34 years and its relationship with land surface temperature (LST) and rainfall using digital change detection approaches. Multi-temporal Landsat imagery (1985, 2000, 2009, and 2019), MODIS, and CHIRPS were used in combination with Google Earth and field data for this study. Support vector machine classification technique was used to produce LULC maps. Mann-Kendall test for LST (2000-2019) and rainfall (1981-2019) was used to compute non-parametric trend analysis. Results revealed that 47,255.5 ha of forest and 24,674.9 ha of other land-cover types had increased from 1985 to 2019. In contrast, agriculture and bare land had decreased by 16,819.9 ha and 55,110.5 ha, respectively. In Dega agro-climatic zone, mean and minimum LST trend analysis has revealed a significant decrease. Sen's slope shows mean, minimum, and maximum LST decreasing trend at 0.13 degrees C/yr., 0.12 degrees C/yr. and 0.10 degrees C/yr., respectively. In Woyna Dega and Kolla, LST trend analysis showed decreasing and increasing trends from 2000 to 2019. Coefficient of determination (r(2)) of forest cover and mean LST for Dega, WoynaDega, and Kolla zones revealed 0.98, 0.81, and 0.20, respectively. Kolla is highly influenced by anthropogenic factors and rapid urbanization that caused depletion of forest cover and conversion of farmlands into human settlements. In future, community-based land-use and land-cover planning and sustainable forest management system are recommended to protect, conserve and rehabilitate the remaining natural environment in the study area.

TI  - Ecological niche modelling for predicting the risk of cutaneous leishmaniasis in the Neotropical moist forest biome
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - A major challenge of eco-epidemiology is to determine which factors promote the transmission of infectious diseases and to establish risk maps that can be used by public health authorities. The geographic predictions resulting from ecological niche modelling have been widely used for modelling the future dispersion of vectors based on the occurrence records and the potential prevalence of the disease. The establishment of risk maps for disease systems with complex cycles such as cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) can be very challenging due to the many inference networks between large sets of host and vector species, with considerable heterogeneity in disease patterns in space and time. One novelty in the present study is the use of human CL cases to predict the risk of leishmaniasis occurrence in response to anthropogenic, climatic and environmental factors at two different scales, in the Neotropical moist forest biome (Amazonian basin and surrounding forest ecosystems) and in the surrounding region of French Guiana. With a consistent data set never used before and a conceptual and methodological framework for interpreting data cases, we obtained risk maps with high statistical support. The predominantly identified human CL risk areas are those where the human impact on the environment is significant, associated with less contributory climatic and ecological factors. For both models this study highlights the importance of considering the anthropogenic drivers for disease risk assessment in human, although CL is mainly linked to the sylvatic and peri-urban cycle in Meso and South America.

TI  - Core components, concepts and strategies for parasitic and vector-borne disease elimination with a focus on schistosomiasis: A landscape analysis
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Author summary
   This landscape analysis explored successful concepts, approaches and interventions of past and ongoing parasitic and vector-borne disease elimination efforts and programs with regard to relevance for progress in the elimination of human schistosome infections. Schistosomiasis is a disabling, water borne parasitic disease of public health concern with an estimated 250 million people infected worldwide. The long-term morbidity of this neglected tropical disease significantly impacts growth, cognition and socioeconomic development at all ages. Despite increased global efforts to control morbidity and advance elimination, challenges in view of the complex life cycle which involves freshwater sources, intermediate snail hosts and humans, remain. This calls for targeted interventions and concerted programs. According to the evidence from the literature and as proposed by a wide range of key informants, comprehensive, multipronged and long-term strategies supported by strong political commitment and adequate funding are required in order to achieve and sustain the set goals. Based on the findings, we propose here a comprehensive set of intervention strategies for schistosomiasis control and elimination for review and evaluation to inform implementation research needs and elimination program design.
   Efforts to control and eliminate human schistosomiasis have accelerated over the past decade. In a number of endemic countries and settings, interruption of schistosome transmission has been achieved. In others, Schistosoma infections continue to challenge program managers at different levels, from the complexity of the transmission cycle, over limited treatment options and lack of field-friendly accurate diagnostics, to controversy around adequate intervention strategies. We conducted a landscape analysis on parasitic and vector-borne disease elimination approaches with the aim to identify evidence-based strategies, core components and key concepts for achieving and sustaining schistosomiasis control and for progressing elimination efforts towards interruption of transmission in sub-Saharan Africa. A total of 118 relevant publications were identified from Web of Science, Pubmed and the grey literature and reviewed for their content. In addition, we conducted in-depth interviews with 23 epidemiologists, program managers, policymakers, donors and field researchers. Available evidence emphasizes the need for comprehensive, multipronged and long-term strategies consisting of multiple complementary interventions that must be sustained over time by political commitment and adequate funding in order to reach interruption of transmission. Based on the findings of this landscape analysis, we propose a comprehensive set of intervention strategies for schistosomiasis control and elimination. Before deployment, the proposed interventions will require review, evaluation and validation in the frame of an expert consultation as a step towards adaptation to specific contexts, conditions and settings. Field testing to ensure local relevance and effectiveness is paramount given the diversity of socio-ecological and epidemiological contexts.

TI  - Predicting forest attributes In southeast Alaska using artificial neural networks
T2  - FOREST SCIENCE
AB  - Artificial neural network (ANN) methods are used to predict forest characteristics. The data source is the Southeast Alaska (SEAK) Grid Inventory, a ground survey compiled by the USDA Forest Service at several thousand sites. The main objective of this article is to predict characteristics at unsurveyed locations between grid sites. A secondary objective is to evaluate the relative performance of different ANNs. Data from the grid sites are used to train six ANNs: multilayer perceptron, fuzzy ARTMAP, probabilistic, generalized regression, radial basis function, and learning vector quantization. A classification and regression tree method is used for comparison. Topographic variables are used to construct models: latitude and longitude coordinates, elevation, slope, and aspect. The models classify three forest characteristics: crown closure, species land cover, and tree size/structure. Models are constructed using n-fold cross-validation. Predictive accuracy is calculated using a method that accounts for the influence of misclassification as well as measuring correct classifications. The probabilistic and generalized regression networks are found to be the most accurate. The predictions of the ANN models are compared with a classification of the Tongass national forest in southeast Alaska based on the interpretation of satellite imagery and are found to be of similar accuracy.

TI  - Using Public Land Cover Data to Determine Habitat Associations of Breeding Birds in Tuskegee National Forest, Alabama
T2  - SOUTHERN JOURNAL OF APPLIED FORESTRY
AB  - A decline in the numbers of breeding songbirds is assumed to be related to habitat loss, but for many species, habitat needs during the breeding season are not well understood. Therefore, we developed habitat use models to quantify habitat relationships for breeding birds within a mostly forested landscape centered on Tuskegee National Forest, Alabama. We conducted bird counts at 338 points and derived habitat characteristics within 100 m of each point using the Alabama Gap Analysis Program land cover map and the National Land Cover Database Tree Canopy Cover map. We modeled avian abundances and habitat associations based on cover type and canopy cover using N-mixture models. We detected more than 16,000 individuals of 85 species, and we present models of abundances for 42 species. Canopy cover was the most influential habitat characteristic, although many species abundances were influenced by cover type. For most species, detection was influenced by observer; date, time, and weather variables were less important in determining detectability. We demonstrate how bird habitat associations can be modeled at a coarse spatial scale using publicly available land cover maps. Our observations regarding the habitat associations of birds in Tuskegee National Forest may be applicable elsewhere within the East Gulf Coastal Plain, but the regional specificity of habitat use should be tested before such extrapolations are justified.

TI  - Assessment of relation of land use characteristics with vector-borne diseases in tropical areas
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Land use and land cover changes play an important role in the occurrence of vector-borne diseases. It is highly essential to identify the prominent changes responsible for its occurrence so that suitable measures can be adopted. An attempt was made to identify the prominent land use and land cover changes responsible for the spread of chikungunya, malaria, and dengue fever in the State of Kerala, India, using hierarchical cluster analysis and multiple regression analysis. Large extent of water bodies, low land and agricultural land played a significant role on the incidence of chikungunya and malaria. High population density, built-up area and agricultural area favoured dengue fever. Vector-borne diseases were found to be the lowest in places where there is no low land and with higher forest area. Inappropriate disposal of wastes generated in the built-up area might be the reason for the spread of dengue fever. Freshwater in drains of these areas is polluted and form breeding grounds for mosquitoes. Hence much attention is to be paid to provide appropriate treatment and disposal of wastes generated in the built-up area of the State In an evolving urban policy, priority is to be given to the installation of safe treatment and disposal facility of wastes especially, sewage, sullage, and solid waste. The protection of forest land also plays an important role. Economic policy instruments such as Payment for Environment Services (PES) schemes, may constitute a useful tool to encourage an improved land use management through appropriate price signals, such as, for instance, for the preservation of forested areas especially in proximity of highly populated urban environments.

TI  - Epidemiology of tree-hole breeding mosquitoes in the tropical rainforest of Imo State, South-East Nigeria
T2  - ANNALS OF AGRICULTURAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICINE
AB  - The study of tree-hole breeding mosquitoes was carried out in the tropical rainforest of Imo State Nigeria (two rural areas and two forest reserves in some parts Of Orlu Senatorial Zone) between May - October 2002. Using standard entomological procedures, two macrohabitats (natural tree-holes and bamboo traps) and two microhabitats (leaf axils of cocoyams/pineapples and leaf axils of plantain/banana) were sampled for various mosquito species. Mosquitoes were recovered from all the various biotypes sampled. Types of mosquitoes species encountered, their relative abundance, as well as genera varied significantly during the Study (p<0.05). Four genera of mosquitoes: Aedes, Culex, Anopheles and Toxorhynchites were recovered while 16 species of mosquitoes encountered include: Aedes aegypti, Ae. africanus, Ae. simpsoni, Ae. albopictus, Ae. stokesi, Ae. taylori, Ae. apicootgenteus, Culex quinquefasciatus, Cv. nebulosus, Cx. trigripes, Cx. decens. Anopheles gambiae, An. funiestus, An. coustani and Toxorhynchites viridibasis. Most of the mosquitoes showed oviposition preferences for one or more habitats. The presence of Ae. africanus, Ae. simpsoni and Ae. aegypti indicate that the study areas were at risk of yellow fever epidemic. The presence of Anopheles and Culex species ensured endemicity of malaria and filariasis, while the recovery of Ae. albopictus in this region suggests a possible outbreak of dengue fever in future if not properly controlled.

TI  - Thermal Physiology, Disease, and Amphibian Declines on the Eastern Slopes of the Andes
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
AB  - Rising temperatures, a widespread consequence of climate change, have been implicated in enigmatic amphibian declines from habitats with little apparent human impact. The pathogenic fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), now widespread in Neotropical mountains, may act in synergy with climate change causing collapse in thermally stressed hosts. We measured the thermal tolerance of frogs along a wide elevational gradient in the Tropical Andes, where frog populations have collapsed. We used the difference between critical thermal maximum and the temperature a frog experiences in nature as a measure of tolerance to high temperatures. Temperature tolerance increased as elevation increased, suggesting that frogs at higher elevations may be less sensitive to rising temperatures. We tested the alternative pathogen optimal growth hypothesis that prevalence of the pathogen should decrease as temperatures fall outside the optimal range of pathogen growth. Our infection-prevalence data supported the pathogen optimal growth hypothesis because we found that prevalence of Bd increased when host temperatures matched its optimal growth range. These findings suggest that rising temperatures may not be the driver of amphibian declines in the eastern slopes of the Andes. Zoonotic outbreaks of Bd are the most parsimonious hypothesis to explain the collapse of montane amphibian faunas; but our results also reveal that lowland tropical amphibians, despite being shielded from Bd by higher temperatures, are vulnerable to climate-warming stress. Fisiologia Termal, Enfermedades y Disminuciones de Anfibios en las Laderas Orientales de los Andes
   Resumen El incremento en la temperatura, una de las principales consecuencias del cambio climatico, se ha implicado en las disminuciones enigmaticas de anfibios en habitats con poco impacto humano aparente. El hongo patogeno Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), actualmente ampliamente distribuido en las montanas neotropicales, puede actuar en conjunto con el cambio climatico, causando un colapso en los hospederos termalmente estresados. Medimos la tolerancia termal de las ranas a lo largo de un amplio gradiente de elevacion en la zona tropical de los Andes, donde las poblaciones de ranas han colapsado. Usamos la diferencia entre la temperatura critica maxima y la temperatura que una rana experimenta en la naturaleza como medida de tolerancia a altas temperaturas. La tolerancia a la temperatura incremento junto con la elevacion, sugiriendo que las ranas de elevaciones mas altas son menos sensibles al incremento en la temperatura. Probamos la hipotesis alternativa del crecimiento optimo del patogeno segun la cual la prevalencia del patogeno disminuye conforme las temperaturas caen fuera del rango optimo para su crecimiento. Nuestros datos de prevalencia de infeccion apoyaron la hipotesis de crecimiento optimo del patogeno ya que encontramos que la prevalencia de Bd incremento cuando la temperatura de los hospederos equivalia a su rango de crecimiento optimo. Estos hallazgos sugieren que el incremento en la temperatura no causa la disminucion de anfibios en las laderas orientales de los Andes. Brotes zoonoticos de Bd son la hipotesis mas parsimoniosa para explicar el colapso de la batracofauna montanosa; pero nuestros resultados tambien revelan que los anfibios tropicales de tierras bajas, a pesar de estar protegidos del Bd por temperaturas mas altas, son vulnerables al estres por cambio climatico.

TI  - Presence and Multi-Species Spatial Distribution of Oropouche Virus in Brazil within the One Health Framework
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE
AB  - Oropouche virus (OROV) is an emerging vector-borne arbovirus with high epidemic potential, causing illness in more than 500,000 people. Primarily contracted through its midge and mosquito vectors, OROV remains prevalent in its wild, non-human primate and sloth reservoir hosts as well. This virus is spreading across Latin America; however, the majority of cases occur in Brazil. The aim of this research is to document OROV's presence in Brazil using the One Health approach and geospatial techniques. A scoping review of the literature (2000 to 2021) was conducted to collect reports of this disease in humans and animal species. Data were then geocoded by first and second subnational levels and species to map OROV's spread. In total, 14 of 27 states reported OROV presence across 67 municipalities (second subnational level). However, most of the cases were in the northern region, within the tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests biome. OROV was identified in humans, four vector species, four genera of non-human primates, one sloth species, and others. Utilizing One Health was important to understand the distribution of OROV across several species and to suggest possible environmental, socioeconomic, and demographic drivers of the virus's presence. As deforestation, climate change, and migration rates increase, further study into the spillover potential of this disease is needed.

TI  - Microbial enzymatic stoichiometry and the acquisition of C, N, and P in soils under different land-use types in Brazilian semiarid
T2  - SOIL ECOLOGY LETTERS
AB  - ? The enzymatic stoichiometry varied between land-use in both soil depth.? The values of C-and N-acquiring enzymes were higher at 0-5 cm depth.? Soils under different land-use types in the Brazilian semiarid are P-limited.This study hypothesized that different land-use affect the microbial enzymatic stoichiometry and C-, N-, and P-acquisition in Brazilian semiarid soils. Thus, the enzymes beta-glucosidase (C-acquiring enzyme), urease (N-acquiring enzyme), and acid phosphatase (P-acquiring enzyme) were assessed in soil samples collected at 0-5 and 5-10 cm depth from a tropical dry forest, a protected area with Angico, a protected area with Ipe, scrub area, and an agricultural area with maize. The values of C-, N-, and P-acquiring enzymes were used to calculate the enzymatic C:N, C:P, and N:P ratios. The values of C:P and N:P ratios were higher at 0-5 cm depth, while no significant variation, between soil depth, was observed for C:N ratio. The values of C-and N-acquiring enzymes were higher at 0-5 cm in tropical dry forest areas and Angico forest, respectively. In all land use types, the values of vectors L and A were higher than 1 degrees and 45 degrees, respectively. This study showed that both land-use and soil depth influence the enzymatic stoichiometry, showing higher values of C-and N-acquiring enzymes in native and protected forests at soil surface.

TI  - Light Converts Endosymbiotic Fungus to Pathogen, Influencing Seedling Survival and Niche-Space Filling of a Common Tropical Tree, <i>Iriartea deltoidea</i>
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Pathogens are hypothesized to play an important role in the maintenance of tropical forest plant species richness. Notably, species richness may be promoted by incomplete filling of niche space due interactions of host populations with their pathogens. A potentially important group of pathogens are endophytic fungi, which asymptomatically colonize plants and are diverse and abundant in tropical ecosystems. Endophytes may alter competitive abilities of host individuals and improve host fitness under stress, but may also become pathogenic. Little is known of the impacts of endophytes on niche-space filling of their hosts. Here we evaluate how a widespread fungal endophyte infecting a common tropical palm influences its recruitment and survival in natural ecosystems, and whether this impact is modulated by the abiotic environment, potentially constraining host niche-space filling. Iriartea deltoidea dominates many wet lowland Neotropical forests. Diplodia mutila is a common asymptomatic endophyte in mature plants; however, it causes disease in some seedlings. We investigated the effects of light availability on D. mutila disease expression. We found I. deltoidea seedlings to preferentially occur under shady conditions. Correspondingly, we also found that high light triggers endophyte pathogenicity, while low light favors endosymbiotic development, constraining recruitment of endophyte-infested seedlings to shaded understory by reducing seedling survival in direct light. Pathogenicity of D. mutila under high light is proposed to result from light-induced production of H2O2 by the fungus, triggering hypersensitivity, cell death, and tissue necrosis in the palm. This is the first study to demonstrate that endophytes respond to abiotic factors to influence plant distributions in natural ecosystems; and the first to identify light as a factor influencing where an endophyte is placed on the endosymbiont-pathogen continuum. Our findings show that pathogens can indeed constrain niche-space filling of otherwise successful tropical plant species, providing unoccupied niche space for other species.

TI  - Fauna of mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) in Goytacazes National Forest and surrounding area, State of Espirito Santo, Southeastern Brazil
T2  - BIOTA NEOTROPICA
AB  - Mosquitoes comprehend a group with a major impact on public health, because some species transmit parasites vertebrate hosts. Comparative studies between preserved environment and disturbed areas provide important epidemiological information, due to the major knowledge on species populational dynamics and the possibility of a contact between vector species and human population. This work aims to characterize and compare the fauna of mosquitoes in the Goytacazes National Forest (GNF) and surrounding area, in the State of Espirito Santo, in Brazil. Collections occurred simultaneously in a preserved environment and in a peridomicile, from 15: 00 to 18: 00, between July 2008 and May 2009. In each environment, it was used a modified trap of Shannon type. As a result, 1,490 specimens from 14 genera and 19 identified species were collected. The species diversity (H = 1.95), species richness (S = 17), equitability index (J = 0.68) and the number of collected specimens (n = 1,100) were higher in the forest environment. The plentiful species were respectively Aedes (Ochlerotatus) scapularis (Rondani, 1848), Culex (Culex) nigripalpus Theobald, 1901 and Aedes (Ochlerotatus) fulvus (Wiedemann, 1828). Our results demonstrate that the occurrence of vector species in this region increases the potential risk of diverse arboviruses occurrence, especially wild-type yellow fever.

TI  - Leishmaniasis Beyond East Africa
T2  - FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE
AB  - Climate change is having a substantial impact on our environment and ecosystems and has altered the way humans live, access, and utilize resources with increased risk of zoonotic infectious disease encounters. As global temperatures continue to increase, they impact on public health, migration, food security and land conflict, and as new environments become favorable, exposure to disease carrying vectors. Increased forests or natural habitat clearance for land repurposing, urbanization, road building, and water management are related to an increase in emerging vector borne parasitic diseases. The East African region remains one of the most impacted regions globally for leishmaniasis, a vector borne disease that impacts significantly on the health, wellbeing and livelihoods of affected communities and for which a lack of reporting and control interventions hinder progress toward elimination of this neglected tropical disease. As our world continues to transform, both politically and climatically, it is essential that measures are put in place to improve surveillance and disease management with implementation of control measures, including vector control, especially in low- and middle-income countries that are expected to be most impacted by changes in climate. Only through effective management, now, can we be sufficiently resilient to preventing the inevitable spread of vectors into suitable habitat and expansion of the geographical range of leishmaniasis. This review offers a current perspective on Leishmaniasis as an endemic disease in East Africa and examines the potential of the recent emergence of Leishmania infection in hitherto unaffected regions to become a public health concern if no disease management is achieved.

TI  - Reducing the blue spectrum of artificial light at night minimises insect attraction in a tropical lowland forest
T2  - INSECT CONSERVATION AND DIVERSITY
AB  - New infrastructure development in previously natural environments is introducing light pollution to habitats at an unprecedented rate, which has the potential to be devastating for native insect assemblages.
   We evaluated insect attraction to three lamp types emitting different spectra of light (white, yellow-filtered and amber-filtered ~3000 K LED lamps) and an unlit control in a lowland forest site in the northern Peruvian Amazon previously naive to artificial illumination.
   Lamp type was the only variable included in the most parsimonious models explaining morphospecies richness and abundance for all insects combined and for eight different insect orders. White lamps (3200 K) attracted far more insects, both morphospecies and individuals, including groups containing important vectors of pathogens, bacteria or parasites, than either yellow (2700 K) or amber (2200 K) lamps.
   Amber lamps attracted the fewest morphospecies and individuals overall but were the most attractive for a limited group of insects, including elaterid beetles (click beetles) and mycetophilid flies (fungus flies).
   While period of night was not a significant predictor of morphospecies richness or abundance, different assemblages of insects were collected during two different sampling periods (18:00-20:00 and 03:00-05:00).
   We strongly recommend that new infrastructure development projects introducing ALAN to light-naive tropical forests use filtered amber LED lamps with no blue and minimal green light content in outdoor lighted areas. Similarly, operators should develop outdoor lighting plans that include overall reduction of nocturnal lighting and impact mitigation measures. These recommendations should also be used to retrofit existing infrastructure including roads and human settlements.
   en espanol
   El desarrollo de nuevas infraestructuras en entornos previamente naturales esta introduciendo contaminacion luminica en esos habitats a una taza sin precedentes, la cual tiene el potencial de ser particularmente devastadora para las comunidades de insectos nativos.
   Evaluamos la atraccion de insectos a tres tipos de lamparas que emiten diferentes espectros de luz (lamparas LED blancas de ~3000K sin filtro, con un filtro amarillo y con un filtro ambar para limitar o eliminar los espectros azules de luz emitidos) y un control sin luz en un sitio de bosque bajo en el norte de la Amazonia peruana, previamente sin iluminacion artificial.
   El tipo de lampara fue la unica variable incluida en los modelos mas parsimonicos que explican la riqueza y abundancia de morfoespecies para todos los insectos combinados y para ocho ordenes diferentes de insectos. Las lamparas blancas (3200K) atrajeron muchos mas insectos, morfoespecies e individuos, incluyendo grupos conocidos por contener vectores importantes de patogenos, bacterias o parasitos, que las lamparas de color amarillo (2700K) o ambar (2200K).
   Las lamparas ambar atrajeron la menor cantidad de morfoespecies e individuos en general, pero fueron las luces mas atractivas para un grupo limitado de insectos, incluyendo a los escarabajos elateridos (escarabajos clic) y las moscas micetofilidas (moscas de los hongos).
   Si bien el periodo de la noche no fue un predictor significativo de la riqueza o abundancia de morfoespecies, se colectaron diferentes ensamblajes de insectos durante los dos periodos de muestreo (18: 00-20: 00 y 03: 00-05: 00).
   Recomendamos enfaticamente que los nuevos proyectos de desarrollo de infraestructura que introduzcan ALAN a bosques sin luces artificiales utilicen luces LED con filtro ambar sin espectro azul y muy poco espectro verde en areas iluminadas al aire libre. Del mismo modo, los operadores deben desarrollar un plan de iluminacion al aire libre que incluya la reduccion general de la iluminacion nocturna y metodos de mitigacion de impactos. Estas recomendaciones tambien deben usarse para modernizar la infraestructura existente, incluidas las carreteras y los asentamientos humanos.

TI  - Forest West African indigenous diet and modernization diseases
T2  - FUNCTIONAL FOODS IN HEALTH AND DISEASE
AB  - This review paper notes that the nutritional essence of an indigenous people's diet can, broadly, be outlined in terms of their food-inherent bioactive chemical functions. Two food crops; Yam (Dioscorea spp.) and the Oil-palm (Elaeis guineensis), define Forest West Africa, agriculturally, as Yam or Palm belt. They can also be said to, broadly, define the diet of the region, which staple base they constitute, as the Yampalm Diet type. Some unique, bioactive, chemical functions of yam identified include; dioscorin, lipoic acid, potassium, biotin and, thiocyanate, while those of oil-palm include; tocotrienols, carotenoids, retinoids and lauric acid. These alkalizing food functions are, in theory, complementary to the acidic tropical physiology of Forest West Africans. Fed on other than the Yampalm diet, Forest West Africans have been demonstrated to be highly susceptible to metabolic syndrome, and some other diseases, due to adopted alien diets. Examples are lactose intolerance from milk and inflammation reaction to wheat gluten. Some food functions of Yampalm diet; dioscorin in yam and tocotrienol from oil-palm, as examples, are efficacious in metabolic syndrome management. They are potential 'Gene-adapted food-function supplements' for emigrants from this area who adopt alien diets. Experiments have shown that restoration of the Forest West African diet ameliorates metabolic syndrome among the people, including their Diaspora in America. Restoration of, genetically or epigenetically, adapted indigenous diet among peoples recommends itself as part of management strategy for modernization diseases.

TI  - Prominent intraspecific genetic divergence within <i>Anopheles gambiae</i> sibling species triggered by habitat discontinuities across a riverine landscape
T2  - MOLECULAR ECOLOGY
AB  - The Anopheles gambiae complex of mosquitoes includes malaria vectors at different stages of speciation, whose study enables a better understanding of how adaptation to divergent environmental conditions leads to evolution of reproductive isolation. We investigated the population genetic structure of closely related sympatric taxa that have recently been proposed as separate species (An. coluzzii and An. gambiae), sampled from diverse habitats along the Gambia river in West Africa. We characterized putatively neutral microsatellite loci as well as chromosomal inversion polymorphisms known to be associated with ecological adaptation. The results revealed strong ecologically associated population subdivisions within both species. Microsatellite loci on chromosome-3L revealed clear differentiation between coastal and inland populations, which in An. coluzzii is reinforced by a unusual inversion polymorphism pattern, supporting the hypothesis of genetic divergence driven by adaptation to the coastal habitat. A strong reduction of gene flow was observed between An. gambiae populations west and east of an extensively rice-cultivated region apparently colonized exclusively by An. coluzzii. Notably, this 'intraspecific' differentiation is higher than that observed between the two species and involves also the centromeric region of chromosome-X which has previously been considered a marker of speciation within this complex, possibly suggesting that the two populations may be at an advanced stage of differentiation triggered by human-made habitat fragmentation. These results confirm ongoing ecological speciation within these most important Afro-tropical malaria vectors and raise new questions on the possible effect of this process in malaria transmission.

TI  - Large-scale population disappearances and cycling in the white-lipped peccary, a tropical forest mammal
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Many vertebrate species undergo population fluctuations that may be random or regularly cyclic in nature. Vertebrate population cycles in northern latitudes are driven by both endogenous and exogenous factors. Suggested causes of mysterious disappearances documented for populations of the Neotropical, herd-forming, white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari, henceforth "WLP") include large-scale movements, overhunting, extreme floods, or disease outbreaks. By analyzing 43 disappearance events across the Neotropics and 88 years of commercial and subsistence harvest data for the Amazon, we show that WLP disappearances are widespread and occur regularly and at large spatiotemporal scales throughout the species' range. We present evidence that the disappearances represent 7-12-year troughs in 20-30-year WLP population cycles occurring synchronously at regional and perhaps continent-wide spatial scales as large as 10,000-5 million km(2). This may represent the first documented case of natural population cyclicity in a Neotropical mammal. Because WLP populations often increase dramatically prior to a disappearance, we posit that their population cycles result from over-compensatory, density-dependent mortality. Our data also suggest that the increase phase of a WLP cycle is partly dependent on recolonization from proximal, unfragmented and undisturbed forests. This highlights the importance of very large, continuous natural areas that enable source-sink population dynamics and ensure re-colonization and local population persistence in time and space.

TI  - Combining participatory games and backcasting to support collective scenario evaluation: an action research approach for sustainable agroforestry landscape management
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE
AB  - The combined and interacting effects of land-use change, resource extraction and climate change threaten the sustainability of millions of mainly smallholder farms in tropical agroforested landscapes. In many of these landscapes, coordinated action among stakeholders at landscape level would help to address challenges such as pests and diseases, price crises and climate change. However, methods to facilitate the co-production of sustainable landscape management in such complex multi-stakeholder systems are currently largely lacking. In this paper, we present a novel approach to explore pathways for the sustainability transition of agroforestry systems. By combining participatory forecasting and backcasting approaches, based on serious games and future vision development, we explore relevant agroforestry management strategies for reaching sustainable future coffee-based agroforestry landscapes. We focused our research on the challenges faced in the main coffee-producing area in Nicaragua. Here, we organized five participatory game sessions to explore farmer decision-making processes, farming strategies and to develop new networks and stimulate social learning among farmers. In the associated backcasting workshop, the most influential game session participants joined technicians, researchers and municipality officials to collectively envision sustainable future landscape management. In all game sessions, farmers developed diversified coffee-based agroforested landscapes characterised by increased density and diversity of shade trees, for the purpose of income diversification as well as forest conservation. During the backcasting workshop, the participants identified policy instruments and community-based solutions for the transition to sustainable landscapes. Our participatory approach facilitated discussion on landscape planning among farmers and other stakeholders and allowed the outline of a pathway towards the collective envisioned future landscape. The combination of participatory forecasting and backcasting proved to be a helpful tool to support multi-stakeholder processes towards sustainable landscape management in this and other complex landscapes.

TI  - Effect of distance to edge and edge interaction on seedling regeneration and biotic damage in tropical rainforest fragments: A long-term experiment
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
AB  - 1. In forest fragments, edge effects can influence forest regeneration, but little is known about how edge effects influence seedling performance and the interaction between seedlings and their natural enemies over time.
   2. In central Amazonia, we recorded survival and growth (in height and leaf number) and damage by insect herbivores and leaf-fungal pathogens of Chrysophyllum pomiferum (Sapotaceae) seedlings that were exposed to different numbers of edges and to different distances from the forest edge. Grown seedlings were transplanted into one-square-metre plots within 1-ha blocks located in the centre (no edge), the edge (one edge), and the corner (two edges), and at different distances from the edge towards the interior (i.e., 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 m) of two rectangular fragments (10- and 100-ha in size). Plots were visited once every 2 months for 1 year (1992-1993) and thereafter every 2 years for almost 8 years (1993-2001).
   3. Overall, results showed that seedling survival, height, leaf number, and biotic damage varied over time with the presence of nearby edges and with the distance from the edge. Survival was lower in fragment edges and corners than in centres. Increase in height was similar for all positions within the 100-ha fragment, whereas in the 10-ha fragment seedling height had a greater increase at the edge and corner than in the centre. Furthermore, survival increased with distance from the edge as did leaf number, whereas height showed a lower increase closer to the edge than farther away.
   4. Regarding biotic damage, for both fragments herbivory was greater at the centres and decreased with edge proximity over time, whereas leaf-fungal damage was greater at the corners than in the edges and increased significantly over time. Biotic damage was correlated with seedling size. Small seedlings were more susceptible to fungal attack, whereas larger seedlings were so to herbivores.
   5. Synthesis. This study demonstrated that despite stochastic environmental factors seedling survival, growth, and biotic damage by herbivores and fungal pathogens varied with the level of edge exposure and proximity, which may threaten forest regeneration in the long term.

TI  - The Relationship between Japanese Encephalitis and Environmental Factors in China Explored Using National Surveillance Data
T2  - BIOMEDICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES
AB  - Japanese encephalitis (JE) is a serious public health issue. This study was undertaken to better understand the relationship between JE distribution and environmental factors in China. JE data from 2005 to 2010 were retrieved from National Notifiable Disease Report System. ArcGIS, remote sensing techniques, and R software was used to exhibit and explore the relationship between JE distribution and environmental factors. Our results indicated that JE cases were mostly concentrated in warm-temperate, semitropical and tropical zones with annual precipitation > 400 mm; Broad-leaved evergreen forest, shrubs, paddy field, irrigated land, dryland, evergreen coniferous forest, and shrubland were risk factors for JE occurrence, and the former five were risk factors for counties with high JE incidence. These findings will inform the effective allocation of limited health resources such as intensive vaccination, surveillance and training in areas with high environmental risk factors.

TI  - Use of Landsat multi-temporal imagery to assess secondary growth Miombo woodlands in Luanshya, Zambia
T2  - SOUTHERN FORESTS-A JOURNAL OF FOREST SCIENCE
AB  - Miombo woodlands are the most extensive natural forest type in subtropical Africa, supporting the livelihood of over 100 million urban and rural settlers. These forests continue to experience extensive deforestation and land degradation due to land use land cover (LULC) changes. The aim of this study is to use remotely sensed images from the Landsat archive to provide the baseline for the spatial extent of Miombo woodlands in Luanshya district of the Copperbelt Province, Zambia. It also assesses the implications of spatial-temporal changes for the conservation of these woodlands. A hybrid classification method involving ISODATA and Support Vector Machine classifiers was used to generate LULC maps for 1986, 1998, 2001, 2004, 2011 and 2016, with an overall accuracy of 82.0%-99.6% and kappa coefficient of 0.80-0.99. Unlike previous studies that have mainly focused on comparison between two or three time periods, a longitudinal analysis over the 20-year periods of this study shows that there are complex net and gross changes in different LULC types over different scales. Landscape change metrics indicate that woodlands have been declining in extent, but are partly offset by regeneration. Rates of deforestation (regeneration) for the periods 1986-1998, 1998-2001, 2001-2004, 2004-2011 and 2011-2016 are 10% (1%), 38% (30%), 15% (7%), 11% (8%) and 9% (2%) per annum, respectively. These results suggest that over 68% of Miombo woodlands present in 2016 are second-growth forests. Restoration strategies such as assisted natural regeneration are necessary in order to accelerate the recovery of natural forests. Targeting under-used and degraded land for assisted natural regeneration and empowering local communities in sustainable environmental stewardship are crucial in remediating against continued forest degradation.

TI  - Risks for ross river virus disease in tropical Australia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - Background There are no analytical studies of individual risks for Ross River virus (RRV) disease. Therefore, we set out to determine individual risk and protective factors for RRV disease in a high incidence area and to assess the utility of the case-control design applied for this purpose to an arbovirus disease.
   Methods We used a prospective matched case-control study of new community cases of RRV disease in the local government areas of Cairns, Mareeba, Douglas, and Atherton, in tropical Queensland, from January I to May 31, 1998.
   Results Protective measures against mosquitoes reduced the risk for disease. Mosquito coils, repellents, and citronella candles each decreased risk by at least 2-fold, with a dose-response for the number of protective measures used. Light-coloured clothing decreased risk 3-fold. Camping increased the risk 8-fold.
   Conclusions These risks were substantial and statistically significant, and provide a basis for educational programs on individual protection against RRV disease in Australia. Our study demonstrates the utility of the case-control method for investigating arbovirus risks. Such a risk analysis has not been done before for RRV infection, and is infrequently reported for other arbovirus infections.

TI  - Hunting Bats for Human Consumption in Bangladesh
T2  - ECOHEALTH
AB  - Bats are important wildlife to their ecologic system, but they are also a zoonotic disease reservoir. Close bat-human interaction can lead to pathogen spillover. We conducted a qualitative study in two districts of Bangladesh and interviewed 30 bat hunters who hunt bats primarily for consumption, to understand the process and their reasons for hunting bats and their perceptions about bats and bat-borne disease. Most hunters catch bats during winter nights, using a net. Bat meat is used for household consumption, and the surplus is sold to cover household expenditures. They prepare the bat meat at home to sell it in their own and in neighboring communities. They also sell live bats to traditional healers. They report that the bat population has declined compared with 5 or 10 years ago, a decline they attribute to hunting and deforestation. Many have heard of a disease from bat-contaminated date palm sap but do not believe that bats can spread such disease to humans. Close bat-human interaction reported in this study pose a risk of pathogen spillover. Conservation initiatives have the potential to reduce such interaction and so both reduce disease risk and support the ecology.

TI  - Seed predation, disease and germination on landslides in Neotropical lower montane wet forest
T2  - JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE
AB  - Seed mortality (caused by predators and pathogens) and germination were compared between Puerto Rico and Costa Pica on landslides in lower montane wet forest. Seeds of six common species on five Puerto Rican landslides and four common species on two Costa Rican landslides were used with a Cecropia species and a Gonzalagunia species included at both sites. In the Puerto Rican experiments Cecropia schreberiana was the only species to show significant seed predation (which was due to insects), pathogens grew from all species and fewer seeds were lost to predators than pathogens. Also in Puerto Rico mean germination across all species was 57 % before dispersal (filled seeds collected while still on the tree) and 71 % after, with Phytolacca rivinoides seeds germinating most abundantly, followed in descending order by Ocotea leucoxylon, Cecropia spec., Miconia racemosa, Palicourea riparia and Gonzalagunia spicata. In the Costa Rican experiments three species had significant predation: Cecropia polyphlebia and Urera caracasana (both due to insects) and Witheringia coccoloboides (due to mammals); pathogenic disease caused more seed loss than predation, and germination was high (61 % pre-dispersal, 69 % post-dispersal).
   Similarities between these island and mainland sites included (1) percentage of seeds lost to predation and percentage lost to pathogens (all in the 5 - 15 % range), (2) generalist pathogens which claimed more seeds than predators and (3) majority germination with a general increase after dispersal. Finally sites were dissimilar only in the number of species with significant predation loss and whether it was by insects or mammals, casting doubt on the traditional island/mainland dichotomy.

TI  - Remote Sensing Based Spatial Statistics to Document Tropical Rainforest Transition Pathways
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - In this paper, grid cell based spatial statistics were used to quantify the drivers of land-cover and land-use change (LCLUC) and habitat degradation in a tropical rainforest in Madagascar. First, a spectral database of various land-cover and land-use information was compiled using multi-year field campaign data and photointerpretation of satellite images. Next, residential areas were extracted from IKONOS-2 and GeoEye-1 images using object oriented feature extraction (OBIA). Then, Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) data were used to generate land-cover and land-use maps from 1990 to 2011, and LCLUC maps were developed with decadal intervals and converted to 100 m vector grid cells. Finally, the causal associations between LCLUC were quantified using ordinary least square regression analysis and Moran's I, and a forest disturbance index derived from the time series Landsat data were used to further confirm LCLUC drivers. The results showed that (1) local spatial statistical approaches were most effective at quantifying the drivers of LCLUC, and (2) the combined threats of habitat degradation in and around the reserve and increasing encroachment of invasive plant species lead to the expansion of shrubland and mixed forest within the former primary forest, which was echoed by the forest disturbance index derived from the Landsat data.

TI  - Historical environmental change in Africa drives divergence and admixture of <i>Aedes aegypti</i> mosquitoes: a precursor to successful worldwide colonization?
T2  - MOLECULAR ECOLOGY
AB  - Increasing globalization has promoted the spread of exotic species, including disease vectors. Understanding the evolutionary processes involved in such colonizations is both of intrinsic biological interest and important to predict and mitigate future disease risks. The Aedes aegypti mosquito is a major vector of dengue, chikungunya and Zika, the worldwide spread of which has been facilitated by Ae. aegypti's adaption to human-modified environments. Understanding the evolutionary processes involved in this invasion requires characterization of the genetic make-up of the source population (s). The application of approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) to sequence data from four nuclear and one mitochondrial marker revealed that African populations of Ae. aegypti best fit a demographic model of lineage diversification, historical admixture and recent population structuring. As ancestral Ae. aegypti were dependent on forests, this population history is consistent with the effects of forest fragmentation and expansion driven by Pleistocene climatic change. Alternatively, or additionally, historical human movement across the continent may have facilitated their recent spread and mixing. ABC analysis and haplotype networks support earlier inferences of a single out-of-Africa colonization event, while a cline of decreasing genetic diversity indicates that Ae. aegypti moved first from Africa to the Americas and then to Asia. ABC analysis was unable to verify this colonization route, possibly because the genetic signal of admixture obscures the true colonization pathway. By increasing genetic diversity and forming novel allelic combinations, divergence and historical admixture within Africa could have provided the adaptive potential needed for the successful worldwide spread of Ae. aegypti.

TI  - Helminth parasites of howler and spider monkeys in Mexico: Insights into molecular diagnostic methods and their importance for zoonotic diseases and host conservation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY-PARASITES AND WILDLIFE
AB  - The majority of the parasite assessments of New World primates have been conducted through the identification of the eggs found in faeces, though many species of parasites have very similar eggs, leaving uncertainty in the diagnosis. Here, we present the results of a parasite survey of the three species of primates distributed in Mexico, combining non-invasive sampling with molecular techniques via DNA extraction of the eggs found in the faeces. Mitochondrial and ribosomal DNA were employed for species identification and Bayesian phylogenetic analysis. Nine parasite taxa were found in the three primate species: the nematodes Trypanoxyuris minutus, T. multilabiatus, T. pigrae, T. atelis, T. atelophora, Strongyloides sp., unidentified Ancylostomatid, unidentified Ascarid, and the trematode Controrchis biliophilus. We were able to extract and amplify DNA from the eggs of the five species of Trypanoxyuris reported for Mexican primates, two morphologically different trematode eggs, and Strongyloides sp. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that the two types of trematode eggs belong to Controrchis biliophilus, a member of the family Dicrocoeliidae. For Strongyloides sp., phylogenetic analysis and genetic divergence showed an association between our samples and S. fuelleborni; however, no species could be established due to the lack of more DNA sequences from Strongyloides sp. occurring in Neotropical primates. The use of molecular and phylogenetic methods could help to overcome the limitations imposed by traditional non-invasive sampling because eggs are primarily obtained from the faeces; however, its utility relies on the extant genetic library and the contributions that expand such library. The information presented here could serve as a basis for future research on primate parasitology, allowing a more accurate parasite diagnosis and a more precise evaluation of their zoonotic potential.

TI  - Impact of Predator Exclusion and Habitat on Seroprevalence of New World <i>Orthohantavirus</i> Harbored by Two Sympatric Rodents within the Interior Atlantic Forest
T2  - VIRUSES-BASEL
AB  - Understanding how perturbations to trophic interactions influence virus-host dynamics is essential in the face of ongoing biodiversity loss and the continued emergence of RNA viruses and their associated zoonoses. Herein, we investigated the role of predator exclusion on rodent communities and the seroprevalence of hantaviruses within the Reserva Natural del Bosque Mbaracayu (RNBM), which is a protected area of the Interior Atlantic Forest (IAF). In the IAF, two sympatric rodent reservoirs, Akodon montensis and Oligoryzomys nigripes, harbor Jabora and Juquitiba hantavirus (JABV, JUQV), respectively. In this study, we employed two complementary methods for predator exclusion: comprehensive fencing and trapping/removal. The goal of exclusion was to preclude the influence of predation on small mammals on the sampling grids and thereby potentially reduce rodent mortality. Following baseline sampling on three grid pairs with different habitats, we closed the grids and began predator removal. By sampling three habitat types, we controlled for habitat-specific effects, which is important for hantavirus-reservoir dynamics in neotropical ecosystems. Our six-month predator exclusion experiment revealed that the exclusion of terrestrial mammalian predators had little influence on the rodent community or the population dynamics of A. montensis and O. nigripes. Instead, fluctuations in species diversity and species abundances were influenced by sampling session and forest degradation. These results suggest that seasonality and landscape composition play dominant roles in the prevalence of hantaviruses in rodent reservoirs in the IAF ecosystem.</p>

TI  - <i>Echinococcus oligarthrus</i> in the subtropical region of Argentina: First integration of morphological and molecular analyses determines two distinct populations
T2  - VETERINARY PARASITOLOGY
AB  - Echinococcosis is a parasitic zoonosis that is considered as a neglected disease by the World Health Organization. The species Echinococcus oligarthrus is one of the causative agents of Neotropical echinococcosis, which is a poorly understood disease that requires a complex medical examination, may threaten human life, and is frequently associated with a low socioeconomic status. Morphological and genetic diversity in E. oligarthrus remains unknown. The aim of this work is to identify and characterize E. oligarthrus infections in sylvatic animals from the Upper Parana Atlantic Forest in the province of Misiones, Argentina, by following an integrative approach that links morphological, genetic and ecological aspects. This study demonstrates, for the first time, one of the complete life cycles of E. oligarthrus in an important ecoregion. The Upper Parana Atlantic Forest constitutes the largest remnant continuous forest of the Atlantic Forest, representing 7% of the world's biodiversity. This is the first molecular determination of E. oligarthrus in Argentina. In addition, the agouti (Dasyprocta azarae), the ocelot (Leopardus pardalis) and the puma (Puma concolor) were identified as sylvatic hosts of Neotropical echinococcosis caused by E. oligarthrus. Mitochondrial and nuclear molecular marker analyses showed a high genetic diversity in E. oligarthrus. Moreover, the genetic distance found among E. oligarthrus isolates is higher than the one observed among Echinococcus granulosus genotypes, which clearly indicates that there are at least two different E. oligarthrus populations in Argentina. This study provides valuable information to understand the underlying conditions that favour the maintenance of E. oligarthrus in sylvatic cycles and to evaluate its zoonotic significance for devising preventive measures for human and animal wellbeing.

TI  - Management of basidiomycete root- and stem-rot diseases in oil palm, rubber and tropical hardwood plantation crops
T2  - FOREST PATHOLOGY
AB  - Basal stem-rot and root-rot diseases caused by basidiomycete fungal pathogens are naturally and widely occurring in a large range of hosts. However, they significantly reduce the productivity of several economically important plantation-crop industries in tropical countries. Oil palm, rubber, acacias and eucalypts are all susceptible to basidiomycete rot pathogens to varying degrees and there is no absolute disease resistance. The causal pathogens are persistent as they remain present in wood or crop debris even in the absence of living members of the host species. Disease build-up is often rapid and can reach economically unacceptable levels in the absence of interventions to contain the disease. This study reviews the biology and detection of root-rot disease in oil palm, rubber and hardwood crops with a specific focus on management strategies undertaken in South-East Asia. The diseases caused by basidiomycete rot pathogens in this region are intractable and require an integrated approach to disease management, as it is unlikely that any one control strategy will succeed. In contrast, there has been significant success in reducing losses from basidiomycete rot from pathogens in the northern hemisphere, especially with Heterobasidion annosum sensu lato in forest trees, research being often supported by the establishment of long-term trials required to understand the origins and types of disease. In the tropics, progress has been more fragmented due to the low level of research funding, the problems involved with managing long-term research trials in the tropics, the confidentiality requirements of competitive industries and the lack of literature available in the public arena. This review collates a large body of information from disparate and often obscure sources for oil palm, rubber, acacias and eucalypts, tropical plantation crops that face similar types of stem- and root-rot disease problems. Lessons to be learned from the successes and failures of various management strategies with each type of crop are examined.

TI  - A vision of tropical biology through the electron microscope
T2  - REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL
AB  - The first electron microscope in Costa Rica was a donation from the government of Japan throught its International Cooperation Agency (JICA) in 1974. This donation made possible the consolidation of what was to become the University of Costa Rica's Electron Microscope Unit (UME). Within three years the first scientific papers were published, dealing with ultrastructural aspects of "Corn's rayado fino virus" and rotavirus, viral agent of human diarrhea. Subsequent papers out of the UME were published for the most part in the Journal of Tropical Biology, totaling at least 50 in that journal alone by the year 2000. With the recent acquisition of Energy Dispersive Spectrometer to coupled in transmission electron microscope and scanning electron microscope to X ray analysis, the data acquisition of the UME has been greatly enhanced, making possible to analyze both structure and elemental chemical composition in a specimen. Other applications of this new technology include studies of environmental pollution with heavy metals, such as comparative analysis of residues on leaves from urban areas and those on leaves from primary forest.

TI  - Leaf flush drives dry season green-up of the Central Amazon
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Understanding how land surface seasonality emerges from individual tree crown phenology is a key challenge of tropical ecology. We used daily images over a full year from a tower-mounted RGB camera to quantify the leaf phenology of 267 individual tree crowns in an evergreen Central Amazon forest. The Green Chromatic Coordinate, an index of each crown's greenness, showed rapid large-amplitude positive and negative changes, each generally occurring once per year. Rapid increase was attributed to leaf flushing and occurred in 85% of all crowns. Rapid negative change occurred in 42% of individuals, caused mostly by massive pre-flush leaf abscission (31% of all crowns). Flushing was concentrated in the five driest months (55% of crowns) compared to the five wettest months (10%). Inter-crown variance of greenness was lowest in the wet season when fewer crowns were abruptly abscising or flushing leaves. With a one month lead, flushing frequency closely tracked seasonal light availability (R = 0.89) and was inversely correlated with rainfall (R = -0.88). We linked the post-flush age of each crown's leaf cohort to the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) of crowns at different phenostages on a nadir view QuickBird image. When aggregated to landscape-scale, this camera-based EVI closely followed (R = 0.95) the MODIS MAIAC EVI of the same site, fully corrected for sun-sensor geometry effects. Leaf phenology therefore drives the dry season green-up detected by MODIS in the Central Amazon. It is also consistent with evolutionary strategies to couple photosynthetic efficiency with light availability and to avoid predation and disease on vulnerable young leaves. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Extrapolation of canopy height and cover metrics of GEDI LiDAR in tropical montane forest ecosystem
T2  - AFRICAN GEOGRAPHICAL REVIEW
AB  - Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI); a full waveform lidar sensor, acquires samples of the terrain and vegetation structures. To derive a spatially continuous estimate, the canopy height and cover metrics retrieved from GEDI L2A and L2B, respectively, were extrapolated using support vector regression models and explanatory variables derived from multiple remotely sensed datasets. Explanatory variables extrapolated GEDI canopy height with RMSE = 3.83 m (R2 = 0.84) as the performance was validated using a subset of GEDI data. However, the accuracy decreased to RMSE = 7.98 m (R2 = 0.65) as validated with field-measured canopy heights. The accuracy of the prediction of forest canopy covers retrieved from GEDI L2B generally remains poor; RMSE = 0.14 (R2 = 0.53).

TI  - Clinical Landscape and Rate of Exposure to Ilheus Virus: Insights from Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
T2  - VIRUSES-BASEL
AB  - Ilheus fever is a mosquito-borne, poorly known tropical disease. We aimed to report the pooled rate of exposure to the Ilheus virus (ILHV) and clinical outcomes of infection to determine the epidemiological patterns of ILHV. We conducted a meta-analysis of 37 studies (n = 17,722 individuals) from Latin America. The common clinical characteristics of ILHV infection were fever (82.3%), headache (52.9%), and myalgia (52.9%). Encephalitis complicated the course of the infection in 29.4% cases. Monotypic serological reactions detected a pooled rate of exposure of 2% to ILHV (95% CI: 1-2). Studies were mainly conducted in Brazil, with a pooled proportion of ILHV positivity of 8% (95% CI: 3-14). Males (12%) had higher rates of seropositivity than females (7%) and had high chances of ILHV infection (OR: 1.7, 95% CI: 1.2-2.5). Seropositivity increased with age, from 2% (95% CI: 2-3) among people aged 0-14 years to 8% (95% CI: 6-10) among people aged 15-64 years. Our analysis indicated a low and relatively constant burden of ILHV in Latin America. More research is needed to evaluate and innovate serological assays for ILHV to better estimate the burden and dynamics of epidemiological changes in ILHV infection in different regions.

TI  - Frequency of <i>Aedes sp</i>. Linnaeus (Diptera: Culicidae) and Associated Entomofauna in Bromeliads from a Forest Patch within a densely Urbanized Area
T2  - NEOTROPICAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - Little is known about the relationship between the presence of Aedes, abiotic factors and the entomofauna existing in phytotelmatas. The aim of this study was to identify biotic and abiotic factors associated with the presence of Aedes in bromeliads sites located in a forest fragment in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. In the study area, eight bromeliads from the Aechmea genus were chosen and kept in landscape form. Physical and chemical variables were measured. Collected aquatic insects were identified according to the literature. A total of 3102 immature insects were collected. The presence of Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus) (2.29%) was rare. Few specimens were found concentrated in urban-adjacent areas during summer. On the other hand, Aedes albopictus (Skuse) (17.57%) was found throughout the year in 0%-80% of the sites, averaging 1.0 mosq/bromelia. Aedes albopictus was found predominantly in central sites of the forest fragment. The Canonical Correspondence Analysis indicates that most taxa had a moderate association with temperature, dissolved oxygen, and pH. The abiotic variables, such as temperature and dissolved oxygen, affect the distribution of the genus Aedes vectors, while most of the other variables did not.

TI  - Integrated remote sensing and machine learning tools for estimating ecological flow regimes in tropical river reaches
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - With the gradual declining streamflow gauging stations in many world-rivers, emphasis is given nowadays to develop remote sensing (RS)-based approaches as the next-generation hydrometry for estimating riverine ecological flow regimes (EFR). For constructing EFR based on daily-streamflow data in scantily-gauged reaches, use of RS techniques in narrow flow-width tropical rain-fed rivers is constrained with the non-availability of finer spatial satellite data at daily scale. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel framework that integrates the enhanced spatiotemporal adaptive reflectance fusion (FUS) of the 250 m x 1-day resolution Aqua-MODIS and 30 m x 1-day resolution Landsat satellite-based remote sensing images in the near-infrared region with the machine learning algorithms. These developed frameworks are named as Artificial Neural Network-based ANNFUS, Random Forest Regression-based RFRFUS, and Support Vector Regression-based SVRFUS models, which were tested for daily-scale streamflow estimation in a typical Brahmani River Basin, India. The results reveal that by addressing the linear and nonlinear dynamism between the streamflow and satellite signals, all the developed models could simulate the streamflow very well with the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency>0.8, Kling-Gupta efficiency>0.8, relative root mean square error (rRMSE) of 0.051-0.12, and normalized RMSE of 0.23-0.36. However, for reproducing the high, median, and low streamflow regimes, the SVRFUS model was found to be the best with the NSE>0.85 and KGE>0.8. Conclusively, the proposed approach is found to have the potential to be replicated in other world-river basins to estimate ecological flow regimes at defunct gauging stations facilitating the basin-scale aquatic environmental management.

TI  - Surface modelling of forest aboveground biomass based on remote sensing and forest inventory data
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
AB  - An accurate estimation of forest aboveground biomass (AGB) is important for carbon accounting. In this study, six methods, including partial least squares regression, regression kriging, k-nearest neighbour, support vector machines, random forest and high accuracy surface modelling (HASM), were used to simulate forest AGB. Forest AGB was mapped by combining Geoscience Laser Altimeter System data, optical imagery and field inventory data. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Wide Dynamic Range Vegetation Index (WDRVI0.2) of September and October, which had a stronger correlation with forest AGB than that of the peak growing season, were selected as predictor variables, along with tree cover percentage and three GLAS-derived parameters. The results of the different methods were evaluated. The HASM model had the best modelling accuracy (small MAE, RMSE, NRMSE, RMSV and NMSE and large R-2). A forest AGB map of the study area was generated using the optimal model.

TI  - Diversity patterns of hematophagous insects in Atlantic forest fragments and human-modified areas of southern Bahia, Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF VECTOR ECOLOGY
AB  - There have been several important outbreaks of mosquito-borne diseases in the Neotropics in recent years, particularly in Brazil. Some taxa are also considered to be indicators of environmental health. Despite the importance of understanding insect abundance and distribution to the understanding of disease dynamics and design strategies to manage them, very little is known about their ecology in many tropical regions. We studied the abundance and diversity of mosquitoes and sand flies in the Bahia State of Brazil, a point of origin for arbovirus outbreaks, including Zika and Chikungunya fever. During 2009-2014, 51 mosquito taxa were identified, belonging to three dipteran families, Ceratopogonidae, Culicidae, and Psychodidae. The family Culicidae, including the Sabethini tribe, were the most abundant (81.5%) and most taxa-rich (n=45). While season (winter and summer) was a strong factor determinant of the occurrence of the most abundant taxa, the stratification level in the forest (ground or tree level) had a strong effect and the dominant taxa at ground level were completely different from the dominant species collected at tree level. We suggest that sites with a mix of forest and agroforestry systems support the highest biodiversity of hematophagous insects as compared to highly disturbed landscapes.

The Anopheles composition, survival and infection rates of malaria and filariasis were compared in the village and 0.5 km from the village ecotype, in forested areas.
   Anopheles leucosphyrus, An. barbirostris and An. donaldi are the vectors for malaria and bancroftian filariasis in both ecotypes. Biting and infection rates vary, but An. leucosphyrus differed with a peak around midnight in the forested area and soon after dusk in the village setting. The parous rate of An. leucosphyrus was significantly higher in the forest ecotype (P<0.0001); however, the proportion of 3-parous and older was not overall higher in the forest ecotype (P=0.68). The entomological inoculation of malaria parasites by An. leucosphyrus was comparatively higher in the forested areas (P>0.5). The implications of malaria and filariasis transmission in the forested areas in Baram District are discussed.

TI  - Biology of Palms and Implications for Management in the Landscape
T2  - HORTTECHNOLOGY
CP  - Workshop on Recent Advances in Palm Horticulture
AB  - Comprising a natural and distinctive group, palms (Arecaceae) differ from other woody plants in their structure and growth features that require or offer unique and sometimes advantageous landscape management opportunities. Although palms are a mostly tropical group that lacks dormancy and cold tolerance, there are numerous species possessing sufficient cool or cold hardiness to be suitable for landscaping in subtropical and even some temperate areas. The habit of palms is largely dependent on the number of stems and the length to which they elongate. There are solitary or multistemmed palms and tree or shrub palms. Regardless of habit, there is typically only one growing point or apical meristem per palm stem. Thus, multistemmed palms may be especially versatile landscape subjects because in many instances, one is able to control height and density by judicious removal of stems. The uniquely constructed palm stem, with growth restricted to its extremities (leaves and inflorescences distally, roots proximally, and wholly the product of primary growth), is composed largely of numerous, dispersed, hard, fibrous-sheathed, vascular bundles embedded in a matrix of water- and carbohydrate-storing parenchyma cells. Often likened to a steel-reinforced concrete column and offering tremendous strength and resiliency, palm stems lack a peripheral vascular cambium and, thus, capability for secondary growth, meaning they do not thicken much once they elongate vertically and there is no ability to repair damaged tissue. Thus, care should be taken when performing horticultural tasks to avoid making wounds (which are permanent, unsightly, and potential entry sites for pests and diseases) and damaging the sole apical meristem. A palm's total photosynthetic and reproductive efforts are concentrated into relatively few but large organs (leaves and inflorescences respectively), offering a unique opportunity to capture an entire year's worth of potential leaf, flower, and fruit litter before it falls into the landscape. The palm root system is adventitious and composed of numerous, small- to medium-sized, nonwoody roots. All primary roots are of a more or less constant diameter and arise independently from an area at or near the base of the stem called the root initiation zone. Because of these root system characteristics and the ability of their trunks to store water and carbohydrates, palms are relatively easy to transplant even large specimens with small root balls-resulting in instant, mature landscapes.

TI  - Responses of plant-pathogen interactions to precipitation: Implications for tropical tree richness in a changing world
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
AB  - Tropical tree-species richness is positively correlated with annual precipitation, but the mechanisms remain unclear. Phytopathogens promote tree-species coexistence by disproportionately afflicting seedlings of locally abundant species, generating a rare species advantage. We consider whether increased plant-pathogen interactions in humid conditions favourable for phytopathogens could drive the precipitation-richness relationship by accentuating the rare species advantage. Support for this mechanism requires that increases in disease under humid conditions disproportionately affect locally abundant species without spreading to rarer species. This criterion would be augmented by either increased phytopathogen host-specificity under humid conditions, or increased asynchronicity in germination of different tree species. Research suggests that precipitation increases the rare species advantage. Increased precipitation enhances phytopathogen transmission, making escape from specialist pathogens more difficult. Additionally, drought stress predisposes plants to disease, especially by opportunistic pathogens. As seasonality in wet forests decreases, scope for asynchronous germination among species increases, potentially concentrating disease transmission within species. Synthesis. The pathways we identify could drive the precipitation-richness relationship, but finding direct evidence for them remains a priority. Researching these pathways is especially important because decreasing precipitation due to climate change could disrupt key species coexistence mechanisms and erode tree-species richness.

TI  - Combining LiDAR and hyperspectral data for aboveground biomass modeling in the Brazilian Amazon using different regression algorithms
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Accurate estimates of aboveground biomass (AGB) in tropical forests are critical for supporting strategies of ecosystem functioning conservation and climate change mitigation. However, such estimates at regional and local scales are still highly uncertain. Airborne Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) and Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) can characterize the structural and functional diversity of forests with high accuracy at a sub-meter resolution, and potentially improve the AGB estimations. In this study, we compared the ability of different data sources (airborne LiDAR and HSI, and their combination) and regression methods (linear model - LM, linear model with ridge regularization - LMR, Support Vector Regression - SVR, Random Forest - RF, Stochastic Gradient Boosting - SGB, and Cubist - CB) to improve AGB predictions in the Brazilian Amazon. We used georeferenced inventory data from 132 sample plots to obtain a reference field AGB and calculated 333 metrics (45 from LiDAR and 288 from HSI) that could be used as predictors for statistical AGB models. We submitted the metrics to a correlation filtering followed by a feature selection procedure (recursive feature elimination) to optimize the performance of the models and to reduce their complexity. Results showed that both LiDAR and HSI data used alone provided relatively high accurate models if adequate metrics and algorithms are chosen (RMSE = 67.6 Mg.ha(-1) RMSE% = 36%, R-2 = 0.58, for the best LiDAR model; RMSE = 68.1 Mg.ha(-1) RMSE % = 36%, R-2 = 0.58, for the best HSI model). However, HSI-only models required more metrics (5-12) than LiDAR-only models (2-5). Models combining metrics from both datasets resulted in more accurate AGB estimates, regardless of the regression method (RMSE = 57.7 Mg.ha(-1) RMSE% = 31%, R-2 = 0.70, for the best model). The most important LiDAR metrics for estimating AGB were related to the upper canopy cover and tree height percentiles, while the most important HSI metrics were associated with the near infrared and shortwave infrared spectral regions, particularly the leaf/canopy water and lignin-cellulose absorption bands. Finally, an analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that the remote sensing data source (LiDAR, HSI, or their combination) had a greater effect size than the regression algorithms. Thus, no single algorithm outperformed the others, although the LM method was less suitable when applied to the HSI and hybrid datasets. Results show that the synergistic use of LiDAR and hyperspectral data has great potential for improving the accuracy of the biomass estimates in the Brazilian Amazon.

TI  - Novel molecular approaches to combat vectors and vector-borne viruses: Special focus on RNA interference (RNAi) mechanisms
T2  - ACTA TROPICA
AB  - Vector-borne diseases, such as dengue, chikungunya, zika, yellow fever etc pose significant burden among the infectious diseases globally, especially in tropical and sub-tropical regions. Globalization, deforestation, urbanization, climate change, uncontrolled population growth, inadequate waste management and poor vectormanagement infrastructure have all contributed to the expansion of vector habitats and subsequent increase in vector-borne diseases throughout the world. Conventional vector control methods, such as use of insecticides, have significant negative environmental repercussions in addition to developing resistance in vectors. Till date, a very few vaccines or antiviral therapies have been approved for the treatment of vector borne diseases. In this review, we have discussed emerging molecular approaches like CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)/Cas-9, sterile insect technique (SIT), release of insects carrying a dominant lethal (RIDL), Wolbachia (virus transmission blocking) and RNA interference (RNAi) to combat vector and vector-borne viruses. Due to the extensive advancements in RNAi research, a special focus has been given on its types, biogenesis, mechanism of action, delivery and experimental studies evaluating their application as anti-mosquito and antiviral agent. These technologies appear to be highly promising in terms of contributing to vector control and antiviral drug development, and hence can be used to reduce global vector and vector-borne disease burden.

TI  - Prediction of soil organic matter content by combining data from Nix Pro™ color sensor and portable X-ray fluorescence spectrometry in tropical soils
T2  - GEODERMA REGIONAL
AB  - Soil organic matter (SOM) measurement is of great agricultural and environmental importance. Thus, the development of rapid, environmentally-friendly, economical and reliable assessment methods is challenging. Soil proximal sensors have become an important approach for SOM prediction worldwide, but require regional calibration. This work aimed to assess the efficiency of SOM content prediction using the Nix Pro (TM) color sensor and portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) spectrometry, either separately or combined. The type of soil horizon collected (A or B) was used as auxiliary input data. A total of 705 Brazilian variable soil samples were analyzed in the laboratory for SOM content and scanned by Nix Pro (TM) and pXRF. Via Nix Pro (TM), samples were analyzed both dry and moist since moisture changes their color. Prediction models were built using 70% of the data via the stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR), support vector machine with linear kernel (SVM) and random forest (RF). Validation was performed with the remaining 30% of the data through the coefficient of determination (R-2), the root mean square error (RMSE) and the residual prediction deviation (RPD). SOM content was predicted with good accuracy (R-2 = 0.73, RMSE = 1.09% and RPD = 2.00) using the RF algorithm trained with combined data from the Nix Pro (TM) and pXRF sensors. Soil horizons and Ca content were the two most important predictor variables. The combination of data obtained by Nix Pro (TM) and pXRF yielded accurate SOM predictions for a wide variety of Brazilian soils, in addition to being environmentally-friendly, without generating chemical waste.

TI  - Consequences of changing rainfall for fungal pathogen-induced mortality in tropical tree seedlings
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB  - Most general circulation models predict that most tropical forests will experience lower and less frequent rainfall in future as a result of climate change, which may reduce the capacity of fungal pathogens to drive density-dependent tree mortality. This is potentially significant because fungal pathogens are thought to play a key role in promoting and structuring plant diversity in tropical forests through the Janzen-Connell mechanism. Therefore, we hypothesize that the drying of tropical forests will negatively impact species coexistence. To test one prediction of this hypothesis, we imposed experimental watering regimes on the seedlings of a tropical tree, Pleradenophora longicuspis, and measured mortality induced by fungal pathogens under shade house conditions. The frequency of watering had a strong impact on survival. Seedlings watered daily experienced significantly higher mortality than those watered every three or every six days, while increasing the volume of water applied also led to increased mortality, although this relationship was less pronounced. These results suggest that the capacity of fungal pathogens to drive density-dependent mortality may be reduced in drier climates and when rainfall is less frequent, with potential implications for the diversity enhancing Janzen-Connell mechanism.

TI  - Data on ectoparasites infestation on small mammals from different habitats in east-coast Peninsular Malaysia
T2  - DATA IN BRIEF
AB  - This data article presents on the ectoparasites infestation on small mammals in Peninsular Malaysia. The dataset on ectoparasites infestation is important because it raises a major medical concern regarding the spread of potentially zoonotic disease from wildlife to human. Tick and chigger are the primary ectoparasites as reservoirs of vector-borne diseases found on small mammals in Malaysia. These small mammals that are infested with ectoparasites occupy various types of habitats, including human settlements, could be of community health risks as the carriers of potentially zoonotic diseases. Field samplings were conducted from February 2015 to February 2016 in three different ecological habitats of mixed dipterocarp forest, coastal forest and insular forest, in Terengganu, Malaysia. A total of 35 and 22 species of bats and rodents respectively were captured and examined for ectoparasites. Twenty-three species of bats and 16 species of small mammal were recorded as hosts for at least one species of ectoparasites. These findings show that the highest ectoparasite infestation occurred on bat community. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - A New Flavivirus and a New Vector: Characterization of a Novel Flavivirus Isolated from <i>Uranotaenia</i> Mosquitoes from a Tropical Rain Forest
T2  - JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY
AB  - A novel flavivirus was isolated from Uranotaenia mashonaensis, a mosquito genus not previously known to harbor flaviviruses. Mosquitoes were caught in the primary rain forest of the Tai National Park, Cote d'Ivoire. The novel virus, termed nounane virus (NOUV), seemed to grow only on C6/36 insect cells and not on vertebrate cells. Typical enveloped flavivirus-like particles of 60 to 65 nm in diameter were detected by electron microscopy in the cell culture supernatant of infected cells. The full genome was sequenced, and potential cleavage and glycosylation sites and cysteine residues were identified, suggesting that the processing of the NOUV polyprotein is similar to that of other flaviviruses. Phylogenetic analyses of the whole polyprotein and the NS3 protein showed that the virus forms a distinct cluster within the clade of mosquito-borne flaviviruses. Only a distant relationship to other known flaviviruses was found, indicating that NOUV is a novel lineage within the Flaviviridae.

TI  - Assessing the performance of indicators resulting from three-component Freeman-Durden polarimetric SAR interferometry decomposition at P-and L-band in estimating tropical forest aboveground biomass
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Aboveground Biomass (AGB) estimation performance in a dense tropical forest using Polarimetric Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolInSAR) data, at P-and L-band, is evaluated. At high levels of biomass, the backscatter saturation effect leads to a low sensitivity of the backscattered intensity for biomass. This study tries to overcome this problem based on decomposition of PolInSAR data into ground, ground-trunk, and volume components to retrieve the vertical structure information of the forest and polarimetric characteristics of layers. Some sensitive parameters, which extracted from Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) and PolInSAR data are chosen. Then, many sets of these features are used for assessing biomass estimation using Linear Regression (LR) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) regression models. The data analyzed in this paper are from the P-and L-band airborne dataset acquired by Office National d'etudes et de Recherches Aerospatiales (ONERA) over French Guiana in 2009, in the frame of the European Space Agency (ESA) campaign, TropiSAR. The average forest biomass is 374.54 t ha(-1) and goes up to 503 t ha(-1) for the in-situ plots. The results display that the indicator of double-bounce (C-DB) contribution matrix, extracted from PolInSAR data decomposition, is the highest correlated feature to AGB, at both P-and L-band. The combination of PolInSAR indicators improved the Root-Mean-Squared Error (RMSE) values up to 24.76 t ha(-1) at P-band and 18.02 t ha(-1) at L-band. At the best state, AGB estimation RMSE reduces to 40.95 t ha(-1) (12.73%) in simultaneous use of the features derived from PolSAR and PolInSAR data, at P-band. SVM produces a more realistic biomass value than LR. However, cross-validated AGB RMSE of two regression models is close to each other.

TI  - Emergence of Tick-Borne Granulocytic Anaplasmosis Associated with Habitat Type and Forest Change in Northern California
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - An important ecosystem service of intact forests is protection from some emerging infectious diseases. Tick-transmitted disease granulocytic anaplasmosis increasingly occupies second-growth forest. We hypothesized that areas of second growth would have increases in tick and rodent abundance, facilitating emergence of anaplasmosis. We predicted Anaplasma phagocytophilum presence as a function of biocomplexity and forest structure, including vegetation, ticks, and rodents in four sites in California. Significant risk factors for exposure included host species (woodrats with 13% seroprevalence, odds ratio [OR] = 8.3 and chipmunks with 27% seroprevalence, OR = 20.7), and park location (northern parks, OR 25.5-27.7). Exposure to A. phagocytophilum was more likely among chipmunks in redwood sites at one park, but with woodrats and oaks at another. Overall, transects on which small mammals showed greatest A. phagocytophilum exposure had high biodiversity in ticks, rodents, and vegetation, as well as intermediate-sized trees with a high mean and variance in diameter at breast height, findings which suggest that a dilution effect, where increased biodiversity reduces disease risk, does not necessarily apply in this system. Thus, enzootic and potentially emerging anaplasmosis were linked to high biodiversity and mature second-growth forest.

TI  - Land cover affects microclimate and temperature suitability for arbovirus transmission in an urban landscape
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - The emergence of mosquito-transmitted viruses poses a global threat to human health. Combining mechanistic epidemiological models based on temperature-trait relationships with climatological data is a powerful technique for environmental risk assessment. However, a limitation of this approach is that the local microclimates experienced by mosquitoes can differ substantially from macroclimate measurements, particularly in heterogeneous urban environments. To address this scaling mismatch, we modeled spatial variation in microclimate temperatures and the thermal potential for dengue transmission byAedes albopictusacross an urban-to-rural gradient in Athens-Clarke County GA. Microclimate data were collected across gradients of tree cover and impervious surface cover. We developed statistical models to predict daily minimum and maximum microclimate temperatures using coarse-resolution gridded macroclimate data (4000 m) and high-resolution land cover data (30 m). The resulting high-resolution microclimate maps were integrated with temperature-dependent mosquito abundance and vectorial capacity models to generate monthly predictions for the summer and early fall of 2018. The highest vectorial capacities were predicted for patches of trees in urban areas with high cover of impervious surfaces. Vectorial capacity was most sensitive to tree cover during the summer and became more sensitive to impervious surfaces in the early fall. Predictions from the same models using temperature data from a local meteorological station consistently over-predicted vectorial capacity compared to the microclimate-based estimates. This work demonstrates that it is feasible to model variation in mosquito microenvironments across an urban-to-rural gradient using satellite Earth observations. Epidemiological models applied to the microclimate maps revealed localized patterns of temperature suitability for disease transmission that would not be detectable using macroclimate data. Incorporating microclimate data into disease transmission models has the potential to yield more spatially precise and ecologically interpretable metrics of mosquito-borne disease transmission risk in urban landscapes.
   Author summary Predicting the effects of temperature on mosquito abundance and arbovirus transmission cycles is essential for mapping hot spots of disease risk and projecting responses to climate change. In urban landscapes, the built environment and natural features create distinctive environments. Buildings and roads generate warmer conditions through the urban heat island effect, while vegetation can have a cooling effect because of shading and evaporative heat loss. We used land cover data to map microclimate temperature in Athens-Clarke County, GA and applied a temperature-dependent vectorial capacity model to predict the effects of microclimate on dengue transmission byAedes albopictus. The highest vectorial capacity was predicted in patches of trees located in the urbanized portion of the study area. These locations had relatively warm nighttime and cool daytime temperature, which kept temperatures close to the optimum for disease transmission. This work demonstrates the feasibility of predicting variation in mosquito microenvironments in urban landscapes using satellite Earth observations. Incorporating microclimate data into disease transmission models has the potential to yield more spatially precise and ecologically interpretable metrics of mosquito-borne disease transmission risk.

TI  - The Influence of Abiotic Factors on the Occurrence of Jackfruit Dieback Disease
T2  - PERTANIKA JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB  - The jackfruit (Artocarpus heterophyllus) is one of six high-value non-seasonal tropical fruits identified as a target for export fruit products in the Malaysia National Key Economic Area (NKEA) report. It is challenging to sustain the jackfruit crop's productivity and achieve the targets for the growth of premium fruits because of the emergence of plant diseases that can affect yields. This paper discusses the influence of abiotic factors, including landscape and weather, on the occurrence of Erwinia carotovora disease. This paper applied Ordinary Least Square (OLS) and hotspot analysis to understand the occurrence of the disease from the landscape and spatial perspective. The findings suggest that the rate of E. carotovora in jackfruit trees (based on a percentage of the area affected) is significantly affected by the proximity of the trees to roads, rivers, and irrigation. At the same time, the frequency of E. carotovora is substantially dependent on rainfall levels. The Koenker (BP) statistic provides a consistent set of results that explain the relationship between variables that impact the occurrence of dieback jackfruit disease remains the same over the study area. This study helps us understand how specific landscape characteristics and climatic variables influence jackfruit dieback disease. This area of research is essential so that the best land management practices can be adapted to prevent future disease occurrences.

TI  - Impact of climate change in the epidemiology of vector-borne diseases in domestic carnivores
T2  - COMPARATIVE IMMUNOLOGY MICROBIOLOGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB  - Vector-borne diseases are medically important in humans and animals but were long considered tropical and known to first affect production animals. This is no longer true and we can see today that they are common in domestic animals and that they are also present in temperate countries, especially in Europe. In recent years, an increase in the diagnosis of vector borne diseases among humans and animals has been observed, which may partly due to the development of diagnostic tools. Their study requires exchanges and collaborations between the many actors involved, especially since the epidemiology seems to be constantly evolving. The veterinary practitioner is the first one to notice the emergence of cases and to implement prevention measures. He also acts as a sentinel to alert epidemiologists. Many factors can explain the epidemiological changes, i.e. all human factors, such as the increase in commercial transportation, but also owners traveling with their pet during the holidays, the development of "outdoor" activities, the increase of individual housings with gardens; to these human factors must be added the ignorance of the risks, linked to animals in general and to wildlife in particular; then the environmental changes: forest fragmentation, establishment of parks; the increase of wild mammal populations (deer, carnivores, rodents, etc.); finally, climate changes. Climate change is a reality which may explain the increase of density of arthropod vectors, but also of their hosts, changes in periods of activity and variations in geographical distribution. The authors show the proof of the climate modifications and then explain how it has an impact in Europe on ticks, mosquitoes, sandflies and even fleas. They conclude on the practical consequences for veterinary practitioners, especially with the diagnosis of parasitic diseases or diseases in areas where they usually do not occur. However, not any epidemiological modification should be linked to climate change, since many other factors are involved and often even overriding. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The total forest area in Romania has been sustainably managed based on ten years plans for more than 50 years. Tilia sp. (lime tree species) area in Romanian forests covered around 214,000 ha in 1966 (1% of the total forest area) but recent data show that the lime - tree species proportion has easily been increasing in the last decades. From the 40 genera and over 350 species of the Tilliaceae family that are spread especially in the tropical and subtropical regions, in Western Romania the lime tree species are represented by three native species of the same Tilia genus: Tilia cordata Mill., Tilia tomentosa Moench. and Tilia platyphyllos Scop. Data from the national forest inventory, data from succesive forest management plans for the period 1968-2016 and recent field research data from Western Romania were analysed The research studies and official reports from the region present lime-tree species as resistent to abiotic (draught, pollution) and biotic stress (no important parasite or disease of Tilia sp. has been reported in the Western part of Romania). An interesting situation is presented in Caransebes area, in the same region. Recent data analysis shows that in this area, the lime-tree species have maintained or even increased their total area in spite of all silvicultural management measures which were performed in the last decades in accordance with the management plans stipulations and which have favoured the beech, oak or coniferous species against the lime trees. The lime tree ecological demands and also its reproductive systems (both vegetative and sexuate) seem to be a competitive advantage in the present-day climate change local context. The future forest management planning activities should consider adequate measures to use the lime-tree species competitive advantage in order to promote a sustainable forest management in the region. The aesthetic species wood qualities and their numerous uses in wood industry are also very important arguments in this respect.

TI  - Scrub typhus islands in the Taiwan area and the association between scrub typhus disease and forest land use and farmer population density: geographically weighted regression
T2  - BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB  - Background: The Taiwan area comprises the main island of Taiwan and several small islands located off the coast of the Southern China. The eastern two-thirds of Taiwan are characterized by rugged mountains covered with tropical and subtropical vegetation. The western region of Taiwan is characterized by flat or gently rolling plains. Geographically, the Taiwan area is diverse in ecology and environment, although scrub typhus threatens local human populations. In this study, we investigate the effects of seasonal and meteorological factors on the incidence of scrub typhus infection among 10 local climate regions. The correlation between the spatial distribution of scrub typhus and cultivated forests in Taiwan, as well as the relationship between scrub typhus incidence and the population density of farm workers is examined.
   Methods: We applied Pearson's product moment correlation to calculate the correlation between the incidence of scrub typhus and meteorological factors among 10 local climate regions. We used the geographically weighted regression (GWR) method, a type of spatial regression that generates parameters disaggregated by the spatial units of analysis, to detail and map each regression point for the response variables of the standardized incidence ratio (SIR)-district scrub typhus. We also applied the GWR to examine the explanatory variables of types of forest-land use and farm worker density in Taiwan in 2005.
   Results: In the Taiwan Area, scrub typhus endemic areas are located in the southeastern regions and mountainous townships of Taiwan, as well as the Pescadore, Kinmen, and Matou Islands. Among these islands and low-incidence areas in the central western and southwestern regions of Taiwan, we observed a significant correlation between scrub typhus incidence and surface temperature. No similar significant correlation was found in the endemic areas (e.g., the southeastern region and the mountainous area of Taiwan). Precipitation correlates positively with scrub typhus incidence in 3 local climate regions (i.e., Taiwan's central western and southwestern regions, and the Kinmen Islands). Relative humidity correlates positively with incidence in Southwestern Taiwan and the Kinmen Islands. The number of wet days correlates positively with incidence in Southwestern Taiwan. The duration of sunshine correlates positively with incidence in Central Western Taiwan, as well as the Kinmen and Matou Islands. In addition, the 10 local climatic regions can be classified into the following 3 groups, based on the warm-cold seasonal fluctuations in scrub typhus incidence: (a) Type 1, evident in 5 local climate regions (Taiwan's northern, northwestern, northeastern, and southeastern regions, as well as the mountainous area); (b) Type 2 (Taiwan's central western and southwestern regions, and the Pescadore Islands); and (c) Type 3 (the Kinmen and Matou Islands). In the GWR models, the response variable of the SIR-district scrub typhus has a statistically significantly positive association with 2 explanatory variables (farm worker population density and timber management). In addition, other explanatory variables (recreational forests, natural reserves, and "other purpose" areas) show positive or negative signs for parameter estimates in various locations in Taiwan. Negative signs of parameter estimates occurred only for the explanatory variables of national protectorates, plantations, and clear-cut areas.
   Conclusion: The results of this study show that scrub typhus in Taiwan can be classified into 3 types. Type 1 exhibits no climatic effect, whereas the incidence of Type 2 correlates positively with higher temperatures during the warm season, and the incidence of Type 3 correlates positively with higher surface temperatures and longer hours of sunshine. The results also show that in the mountainous township areas of Taiwan's central and southern regions, as well as in Southeastern Taiwan, higher SIR values for scrub typhus are associated with the following variables: farm worker population density, timber management, and area type (i.e., recreational forest, natural reserve, or other purpose).

TI  - Temporal modelling of Lymnaea natalensis (Krauss, 1848) in tropical aquatic habitats
T2  - ONDERSTEPOORT JOURNAL OF VETERINARY RESEARCH
AB  - Lymnaea natalensis is the only snail intermediate host of Fasciola gigantica, the causative agent of fascioliasis, in Nigeria. The species also serves as intermediate host for many other African trematode species of medical and veterinary importance, and it is found throughout the country. However, there is no detailed information on the factors that influence its distribution and seasonal abundance in the tropical aquatic habitats in Nigeria. This study used the geographic information system and remotely sensed data to develop models for predicting the distribution of L. natalensis in South-Western Nigeria. Both land surface temperature (LST) and normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) were extracted from Landsat satellite imagery; other variables (slope and elevation) were extracted from a digital elevation model (DEM) while rainfall data were retrieved from the European Meteorology Research Programme (EMRP). These environmental variables were integrated into a geographic information system (GIS) to predict suitable habitats of L. natalensis using exploratory regression. A total of 1410 L. natalensis snails were collected vis-a-vis 22 sampling sites. Builtup areas recorded more L. natalensis compared with farmlands. There was no significant difference in the abundance of snails with season (p > 0.05). The regression models showed that rainfall, NDVI, and slope were predictors of L. natalensis distribution. The habitats suitable for L. natalensis were central areas, while areas to the north and south were not suitable for L. natalensis.

TI  - Transmission and Control of <i>Plasmodium knowlesi</i>: A Mathematical Modelling Study
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Introduction: Plasmodium knowlesi is now recognised as a leading cause of malaria in Malaysia. As humans come into increasing contact with the reservoir host (long-tailed macaques) as a consequence of deforestation, assessing the potential for a shift from zoonotic to sustained P. knowlesi transmission between humans is critical.
   Methods: A multi-host, multi-site transmission model was developed, taking into account the three areas (forest, farm, and village) where transmission is thought to occur. Latin hypercube sampling of model parameters was used to identify parameter sets consistent with possible prevalence in macaques and humans inferred from observed data. We then explore the consequences of increasing human-macaque contact in the farm, the likely impact of rapid treatment, and the use of long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs) in preventing wider spread of this emerging infection.
   Results: Identified model parameters were consistent with transmission being sustained by themacaques with spill over infections into the human population and with high overall basic reproduction numbers (up to 2267). The extent to which macaques forage in the farms had a non-linear relationship with human infection prevalence, the highest prevalence occurring when macaques forage in the farms but return frequently to the forest where they experience higher contact with vectors and hence sustain transmission. Only one of 1,046 parameter sets was consistent with sustained human-to-human transmission in the absence of macaques, although with a low human reproduction number (R-0H = 1.04). Simulations showed LLINs and rapid treatment provide personal protection to humans with maximal estimated reductions in human prevalence of 42% and 95%, respectively.
   Conclusion: This model simulates conditions where P. knowlesi transmission may occur and the potential impact of control measures. Predictions suggest that conventional control measures are sufficient at reducing the risk of infection in humans, but they must be actively implemented if P. knowlesi is to be controlled.

TI  - Malignant Snare Traps Threaten an Irreplaceable Megafauna Community
T2  - TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE
AB  - Tropical forests are under severe threat from over-hunting. Subsistence harvests and poaching have decimated wildlife populations to the extent that nearly 50% of Earth's tropical forests are partially or fully devoid of large mammals. Declines are particularly acute in Southeast Asia where ongoing defaunation, largely attributable to indiscriminate snare trapping, is widespread. Using the extensively forested Aceh province in northern Sumatra as a case study, we document rampant snaring, which threatens Earth's last sympatric population of tigers, rhinoceros, elephants, and orangutans. To prevent catastrophic hunting-induced impacts already experienced in mainland Southeast Asia, we call for more comprehensive conservation planning assessments that strengthen wildlife law enforcement, promote collaborative anti-poaching, and research species-specific snaring impacts, particularly in the context of human-wildlife conflict. We conclude with a discussion of the important linkages between poaching, wildlife trade, and zoonotic disease risk.

TI  - Status of Insecticide Resistance and Its Mechanisms in <i>Anopheles gambiae</i> and <i>Anopheles coluzzii</i> Populations from Forest Settings in South Cameroon
T2  - GENES
AB  - A key factor affecting malaria vector control efforts in Cameroon is the rapid expansion of insecticide resistance in Anopheles gambiae s.l (An. gambiae) populations; however, mechanisms involved in insecticide resistance in forest mosquito populations are still not well documented yet. The present study was conducted to screen molecular mechanisms conferring insecticide resistance in An. gambiae s.l. populations from the South Cameroon forest region. WHO bioassays were conducted with F0 An. gambiae females aged three to four days from forest (Sangmelima, Nyabessan, and Mbandjock) and urban sites (Yaounde (Bastos and Nkolondom)), against pyrethroids (permethrin 0.75% and deltamethrin 0.05%) and carbamates (bendiocarb 0.1%). Members of the An. Gambiae s.l. species complex were identified using molecular diagnostic tools. TaqMan assays were used to screen for target site mutations. The expression profiles of eight genes implicated in insecticide resistance were assessed using RT-qPCR. Cuticle hydrocarbon lipids were measured to assess their potential implication in insecticide resistance. Both An. Gambiae and An. coluzzii were detected. An. gambiae was highly prevalent in Sangmelima, Nyabessan, Mbandjock, and Nkolondom. An. coluzzii was the only species found in the Yaounde city center (Bastos). Low mortality rate to both pyrethroids and bendiocarb was recorded in all sites. High frequency of L1014F allele (75.32-95.82%) and low frequencies of L1014S (1.71-23.05%) and N1575Y (5.28-12.87%) were recorded. The G119S mutation (14.22-35.5%) was detected for the first time in An. gambiae populations from Cameroon. This mutation was rather absent from An. coluzzii populations. The detoxification genes Cyp6m2, Cyp9k1, Cyp6p4, Cyp6z1, as well as Cyp4g16 which catalyzes epicuticular hydrocarbon biosynthesis, were found to be overexpressed in at least one population. The total cuticular hydrocarvbon content, a proxy of cuticular resistance, did not show a pattern associated with pyrethroid resistance in these populations. The rapid emergence of multiple resistance mechanisms in An. Gambiae s.l. population from the South Cameroon forest region is of big concern and could deeply affect the sustainability of insecticide-based interventions strategies in this region.

TI  - Rehabilitation of degraded dryland ecosystems - review
T2  - SILVA FENNICA
AB  - Land degradation is widespread and a serious threat affecting the livelihoods of 1.5 billion people worldwide of which one sixth or 250 million people reside in drylands. Globally, it is estimated that 10-20% of drylands are already degraded and about 12 million ha are degraded each year. Driven by unsustainable land use practices, adverse climatic conditions and population increase, land degradation has led to decline in provision of ecosystem services, food insecurity, social and political instability and reduction in the ecosystem's resilience to natural climate variability. Several global initiatives have been launched to combat land degradation, including rehabilitation of degraded drylands. This review aimed at collating the current state-of-knowledge about rehabilitation of degraded drylands. It was found that the prospect of restoring degraded drylands is technically promising using a suite of passive (e.g. area exclosure, assisted natural regeneration, rotational grazing) and active (e.g. mixed-species planting, framework species, maximum diversity, and use of nurse tree) rehabilitation measures. Advances in soil reclamation using biological, chemical and physical measures have been made. Despite technical advances, the scale of rehabilitation intervention is small and lacks holistic approach. Development of process-based models that forecast outcomes of the various rehabilitation activities will be useful tools for researchers and practitioners. The concept of forest landscape restoration approach, which operates at landscape-level, could also be adopted as the overarching framework for rehabilitation of degraded dryland ecosystems. The review identified a data gap in cost-benefit analysis of rehabilitation interventions. However, the cost of rehabilitation and sustainable management of drylands is opined to be lower than the losses that accrue from inaction, depending on the degree of degradation. Thus, local communities' participation, incorporation of traditional ecological knowledge, clear division of tasks and benefits, strengthening local institutions are crucial not only for cost-sharing, but also for the long-term success of rehabilitation activities.

TI  - Lens on Tropical Sericulture Development in Indonesia: Recent Status and Future Directions for Industry and Social Forestry
T2  - INSECTS
AB  - Simple Summary Sericulture is a labor-intensive agro-industry business that can increase the community's welfare and support environmental improvement. In Indonesia, silk, as the final product of sericulture, is a potential non-timber forest product (NTFP) that provides benefits to livelihoods and the forest ecosystem. Silk is a fiber produced by the domestic silkworm or mulberry silk moth, Bombyx mori L., belonging to the Lepidopteran order, Bombycidae family, probably providing more than 99% of the world's silk. However, there are many challenges to its development at both upstream and downstream levels, including the availability of quality eggs, optimal and efficient cultivation, pest and disease control, a lack of policy support, unsustainable production, low product quality, and competition with imported products. This paper discusses the recent status and future directions of sericulture development in Indonesia. Improvements in technical and social-economic aspects can support the development of sericulture in Indonesia through increasing productivity in the upstream sector along with conducive downstream policies and governance. The domestic silkworm or mulberry silk moth, B. mori L., provides more than 99% of the world's silk. Silk, as a sericulture product, was first introduced in Indonesia through a trade mechanism and began to develop in 1953. Several factors (economic, ecological, market, and cultural) support sericulture and make it become one of the non-timber forest product priorities. However, the competitive advantages alone have not encouraged the development of prospective sericulture industry in Indonesia yet. This paper is a review of tropical sericulture development in Indonesia. The literature on the development of sericulture in Indonesia between 1989 and 2022 is used to describe conditions related to mulberry cultivation (moriculture), and silkworm rearing (sericulture), as well as the state of socio-economic development, culture, and institutions. Moriculture and sericulture techniques, socio-economic aspects, institutional arrangements, and community motivations are intertwined, creating a challenging atmosphere for sericulture development. There are potential resources, such as exploring quality mulberry production and quality silkworm production through research and development, valuable cultural aspects, and potential stakeholders to build network engagement. Commitment, cooperation, and action from all stakeholders are needed to enhance the development of sericulture in Indonesia. In this context, the central government can play an important role in facilitating multi-stakeholder partnerships in the development of integrated sericulture in Indonesia.

TI  - Investigation about the Occurrence of Transmission Cycles of Arbovirus in the Tropical Forest, Amazon Region
T2  - VIRUSES-BASEL
AB  - Because of its ecological characteristics, the Caxiuana National Forest (FLONA) is a potential area of arbovirus circulation. The present study aimed to investigate the occurrence of arbovirus transmission cycles at FLONA de Caxiuana. Five field trips were performed to capture mosquitoes and sylvatic vertebrates. For these vertebrates, we attempted viral isolation by cell monolayer inoculation from blood, and hemagglutination inhibition and further seroneutralization assays from sera. For mosquitoes, we performed tests of viral genome detection. A total of 338 vertebrates were captured, and the greatest representative was birds (251/74.26%). A total of 16,725 mosquitoes were captured, distributed among 56 species. There were no viruses isolated by newborn mouse inoculation. Among birds, antibodies against Ilheus virus were the most prevalent. Catu virus, Caraparu virus, and Mucambo virus were the most prevalent among mammals and reptiles. Fragments of Mucambo virus, Ilheus virus, Bussuquara virus, and Rocio virus genome were detected in a pool of mosquito samples. These results of the study suggest the occurrence of arbovirus transmission cycles in the FLONA of Caxiuana. The proximity of human populations with elements, involved in transmission cycles, makes surveillance necessary in this population to avoid dispersion of arboviruses to naive locations.

TI  - Chytrid fungus in amphibians from the lowland Brazilian Amazon
T2  - DISEASES OF AQUATIC ORGANISMS
AB  - Infectious diseases are one of the main threats to biodiversity. The fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) is associated with several amphibian losses around the globe, and environmental conditions may dictate the success of pathogen spread. The Brazilian Amazon has been considered climatically unsuitable for chytrid fungus, but additional information on Bd dynamics in this ecoregion is still lacking. We sampled 462 amphibians (449 anurans, 4 caudatans and 9 caecilians), representing 57 species from the Brazilian Amazon, and quantified Bd infections using qPCR. We tested whether abiotic variables predicted the risk of Bd infections, and tested for relationships between biotic variables and Bd. Finally, we experimentally tested the effects of Bd strains CLFT 156 and CLFT 102 (from the southern and northern Atlantic Forest, respectively) on Atelopus manauensis. We detected higher Bd prevalence than those previously reported for the Brazilian Amazon, and positive individuals in all 3 orders of amphibians sampled. Both biotic and abiotic predictors were related to prevalence, and no variable explained infection load. Moreover, we detected higher Bd prevalence in forested than open areas, while the host's reproductive biology was not a factor. We detected higher mortality in the experimental group infected with CLFT 156, probably because this strain was isolated from a region characterized by discrepant climatic conditions (latitudinally more distant) when compared with the host's sampling site in Amazon. The lowland Brazilian Amazon is still underexplored and future studies targeting all amphibian orders are essential to better understand Bd infection dynamics in this region.

TI  - Intensity prediction of tropical cyclone using multilayer multi-block local binary pattern and tree-based classifiers over North Indian Ocean
T2  - COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES
AB  - Local binary pattern (LBP) is an extensively used method in image analysis and pattern recognition related works across various domains. In this paper, we explore cyclone cloud evolution patterns using a modified LBP. The multilayer multi-block local binary pattern (MMLBP) is an extended version of Completed LBP (CLBP) with multiple blocks and many layers. A tropical cyclone (TC) image is converted into 3 x 3 identical blocks to generate central pixels using CLBP magnitude descriptor block-wise (CLBP_MB). These central pixels are used to find the next layer, which is further divided into 3 x 3 blocks to generate central pixels by CLBP_MB descriptor. This technique will iterate until the dimension of the final layer reached to 1 x 1. These central pixels are extracted from each layer and gather in a vector called a feature vector. The proposed method is applied to 600 tropical cyclone (TC) images and each image generates one feature vector. Hence, 600 vectors are passed through tree-based classifiers to classify cyclone images of various classes. The proposed method of feature extraction and classification reaches a maximum of 84.66% accuracy using Random Forest (RF) classifier. The root mean squared error (RMSE) of the MMLBP method is 9.27 kt, which is better than the LBP and MBLBP approaches. Finally, the size of the original feature vector is reduced to 97.4% using correlation based feature subset selection method.

TI  - Sympatric occurrence of forest and savannah morphotypes of<i>Simulium damnosum</i>complex (Diptera: Simuliidae) in Osun State, Nigeria
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TROPICAL INSECT SCIENCE
AB  - Simulium damnosumTheobald complex is a group of black flies which vector filarial worms that cause onchocerciasis in Africa. Studies were conducted to investigate the morphological composition of adultS. damnosumcomplex in three ecological zones of Osun State, Nigeria. Adult black flies were sampled between October 2014 and September 2016, and the wing tufts, antennae, fore coxae and other morphotaxonomic characters were observed and classified following standard methods. The results revealed a sympatric occurrence of both forest- and savannah-dwelling groups (morphotypes) of black flies at each zone with the Guinea savannah zone (Iwo) having significantly higher abundance of forest than savannah black flies. The derived savannah (Ede) had higher abundance of savannah than forest black flies while the rainforest (Obokun) had more forest than savannah black flies but there was no significant difference between them. In Iwo, the highest abundance of forest flies was obtained in October and June while savannah flies were highest in November. The monthly abundance of each morphotype of black flies was significantly different in Ede but not in Obokun. Wing tuft colours among forest flies varied significantly in Iwo and Ede. This study indicates that there is substantial morphological diversity among sibling species of black flies which is useful for identification and could be exploited in black fly control. The presence of savannah flies in the three zones calls for surveillance for potential incursion of blinding parasite strain which migrant savannah flies could introduce to the communities.

AB  - Amphibian chytridiomycosis (caused by Batrachochytrium dendrobatis; Bd) was first identified in 1998 and has since been implicated in numerous amphibian declines worldwide. Most researchers have since investigated broad-scale geographic and taxonomic occurrences of the pathogen in tropical lotic or cool montane systems. In this study, we analyzed how environmental factors, land use practices, and landscape structure may affect the dynamics of the pathogen's distribution in a landscape dominated by lentic systems within a region of Mediterranean climate. We quantified the occurrence of Bd testing the six resident amphibian species that occur in 54 isolated perennial and ephemeral ponds in central California between May and June annually from 2004 to 2007. The geographic distribution of Bd within the landscape varied markedly between years. Inter-annual variation in climate affected the pond landscape structure indicating that climate conditions indirectly influence the distribution of the pathogen. Fourteen ponds, 12 perennial and 2 ephemeral, were positive for Bd >= 3 yr of the study and were treated as Bd hotpots for comparative purposes. Occurrences of Bd within the landscape were spatially autocorrelated and ponds within similar to 1000-1500 m of Bd hotspots were more likely to test positive. Local land use, (presence/absence of grazing or recreational activity and developed lands), did not influence Bd status of a pond, indicating that the most likely means of Bd transmission between ponds may be waterfowl and/or amphibians.

TI  - Modeling risk of mangroves to tropical cyclones: A case study of Hurricane Irma
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
AB  - Mangrove forests are productive ecosystems but are vulnerable to tropical cyclones. In this study, we quantified the damage of mangroves from Hurricane Irma at a large-scale using Landsat data, and modeled the risk of mangroves to hurricanes using three internal/physical metrics (a vegetation index, canopy height, and distance to open ocean) and two external/hurricane-related metrics (hurricane track and storm surge inundation). Four machine learning techniques including Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) were examined and compared with the Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) method to identify the best risk model for damage projection from future hurricanes. The models were calibrated and validated using data before and after Hurricane Irma. Machine learning algorithms had a better performance than the linear model, and RF achieved the best result with a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.84 in predicting mangrove damages. The model also produced an encouraging result to hindcast mangrove damages from Hurricane Wilma. We applied object-based modeling and mapping techniques and produced mangrove damage maps from Irma and a worst-case scenario hurricane with an intensity of Category 5 and a track along the mangrove distribution. A total of 332 km(2) of mangroves were severely damaged from Irma, and 635 km(2) would be devastated from the modeled scenario. The techniques developed here can be used for other mangrove forests exposed to tropical cyclones.

TI  - A Machine Learning (ML)-Based Approach to Improve Tropical Cyclone Intensity Prediction of NCMRWF Ensemble Prediction System
T2  - PURE AND APPLIED GEOPHYSICS
AB  - Global numerical weather prediction (NWP) models, including ensemble prediction systems (EPS), are routinely used by the forecasters to predict tropical cyclone (TC) tracks and intensity. However, due to computational restrictions, the EPSs are usually of coarse resolution, which results in poor prediction of TC intensity. The bias in the model predicting maximum sustained winds (MSW) and central pressure (CP) is large when TCs are intense. This article describes the suitability of machine learning (ML) techniques to reduce errors in TC intensity forecasts obtained from the National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (NCMRWF) Ensemble Prediction System (NEPS) over the North Indian Ocean (NIO). Four different ML techniques, namely, Multivariate Linear Regression (MLR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest (RF), and eXtreme Gradient Boost (XGB), have been used for the bias correction (BC) of mean MSW and CP, while the spread of ensemble members has been retained. The study is based on 20 TC cases formed over the NIO during 2018-21. The best track (BT) information from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has been used for training the ML models and verifying them. The results show that XGB (for CP) and RF (for MSW) ML techniques are superior to MLR and SVR methods. The statistically significant reduction (at 99% CI) in mean absolute error (MAE) (root mean square error (RMSE) of mean MSW and CP while using the best algorithm are 30 (33)% and 63 (55)%, respectively. The correlation coefficient for CP increases from 0.58 to 0.93 and that for MSW from 0.60 to 0.75. The probabilistic verification of bias-corrected ensemble members also suggests that the RF- and XGB-based models have better reliability and ROC compared to the raw and other models for MSW and CP, respectively.

TI  - Global characterization and monitoring of forest cover using Landsat data: opportunities and challenges
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
AB  - The compilation of global Landsat data-sets and the ever-lowering costs of computing now make it feasible to monitor the Earth's land cover at Landsat resolutions of 30 m. In this article, we describe the methods to create global products of forest cover and cover change at Landsat resolutions. Nevertheless, there are many challenges in ensuring the creation of high-quality products. And we propose various ways in which the challenges can be overcome. Among the challenges are the need for atmospheric correction, incorrect calibration coefficients in some of the data-sets, the different phenologies between compilations, the need for terrain correction, the lack of consistent reference data for training and accuracy assessment, and the need for highly automated characterization and change detection. We propose and evaluate the creation and use of surface reflectance products, improved selection of scenes to reduce phenological differences, terrain illumination correction, automated training selection, and the use of information extraction procedures robust to errors in training data along with several other issues. At several stages we use Moderate Resolution Spectro-radiometer data and products to assist our analysis. A global working prototype product of forest cover and forest cover change is included.

TI  - Water pollution and distribution of the black fly (Diptera: Simuliidae) in the Atlantic Forest, Brazil
T2  - REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL
AB  - Black flies have medical importance because some species are vectors of the Onchocerciasis and Mansonelosis, nevertheless, their ecology and potential use as bioindicators is still poorly studied in the Neotropical Region. In Brazil, bioindicators use is strongly focused in a multimetrical ecological index approach; this way, we investigated the black fly spatial distribution, in relation to abiotic factors correlated to water quality, to provide baseline information for their utilization as standalone indicators of lotic systems integrity. We have tested the hypothesis that environmental changes related to urbanization, lead to decreased abundance and loss in the number of species of the black fly fauna. The sampling was conducted in 10 urban and 10 preserved streams during the dry season (August-September) of 2012, in the mountainous region of Teresopolis, State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The streams were characterized for their environmental integrity conditions and physico-chemical properties of water. In each stream, five different rapid points were sampled in a section of 50 meters, 10 meters apart from each other. The black flies were sampled with a kick-net sampler on rocky substrates. The material was separated and the larvae were sorted in morphotypes, and later, the final instar specimens were dissected and identified with the help of taxonomical literature at species level. A total abundance of 488 larvae from nine species were collected, 5 (1.02 %) in extremely impacted streams, 470 (96.31 %) in intermediate streams and 13 (2.66 %) in preserved streams. The visual evaluation (HIT) differed in relation to the water physico-chemical evaluation, in which more variation in the characterization of the sampling sites was observed. In Canonical Correspondence Analysis Simulium subpallidum, S. inscrustatum and S. pertinax were significantly associated with intermediate values of most of the variables, and then to intermediate impacted sites. On the other hand, Lutzsimulium hirticosta, S. subnigrum and Simulium sp. A were associated to low values of chemical variables, and then to more preserved sites. Most studies on the bioindicator potential of Simuliidae have suggested an approach to agricultural impacts, while our results, on the other hand, showed that Shnuliidae species were present in streams with intermediate urban pollution impacts, but absent in heavily impacted sites. Thus, our data suggested that some species are associated to more pristine breeding sites, such as L. hirticosta and Simulium sp. A, while others may be good bioindicators of moderately impacted streams, such as S. pertinax, S. subnigrum and S. subpallidum.

TI  - Genetic Evidence of Contemporary Dispersal of the Intermediate Snail Host of <i>Schistosoma japonicum</i>: Movement of an NTD Host Is Facilitated by Land Use and Landscape Connectivity
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   While the dispersal of hosts and vectors D through active or passive movement D is known to facilitate the spread and re-emergence of certain infectious diseases, little is known about the movement ecology of Oncomelania spp., intermediate snail host of the parasite Schistosoma japonicum, and its consequences for the spread of schistosomiasis in East and Southeast Asia. In China, despite intense control programs aimed at preventing schistosomiasis transmission, there is evidence in recent years of re-emergence and persistence of infection in some areas, as well as an increase in the spatial extent of the snail host. A quantitative understanding of the dispersal characteristics of the intermediate host can provide new insights into the spatial dynamics of transmission, and can assist public health officials in limiting the geographic spread of infection.
   Methodology/Principal findings
   Oncomelania hupensis robertsoni snails (n = 833) were sampled from 29 sites in Sichuan, China, genotyped, and analyzed using Bayesian assignment to estimate the rate of recent snail migration across sites. Landscape connectivity between each site pair was estimated using the geographic distance distributions derived from nine environmental models: Euclidean, topography, incline, wetness, land use, watershed, stream use, streams and channels, and stream velocity. Among sites, 14.4% to 32.8% of sampled snails were identified as recent migrants, with 20 sites comprising >20% migrants. Migration rates were generally low between sites, but at 8 sites, over 10% of the overall host population originated from one proximal site. Greater landscape connectivity was significantly associated with increased odds of migration, with the minimum path distance (as opposed to median or first quartile) emerging as the strongest predictor across all environmental models. Models accounting for land use explained the largest proportion of the variance in migration rates between sites. A greater number of irrigation channels leading into a site was associated with an increase in the site's propensity to both attract and retain snails.
   Conclusions/Significance
   Our findings have important implications for controlling the geographic spread of schistosomiasis in China, through improved understanding of the dispersal capacity of the parasite's intermediate host.

TI  - Phytomedicinal potential of tropical cloudforest plants from Monteverde, Costa Rica
T2  - REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL
AB  - A pharmacological survey of plants from Monteverde, Costa Rica, including 165 species representing 61 families has been carried out. Crude plant extracts have been tested for in-vitro bactericidal and fungicidal activity as well as cytotoxic and anti-herpes activity. Of these, 123 extracts exhibited notable cytotoxicity, 62 showed antibacterial activity, 4 showed antifungal activity, and 8 showed promising antiviral activity. Thus, 101 of the plant species examined in this work, or 62%, showed marked bioactivity in one or more bioassays. These results underscore the phytomedicinal potential of Neotropical cloud forests.

TI  - Anthrax kills wild chimpanzees in a tropical rainforest
T2  - NATURE
AB  - Infectious disease has joined habitat loss and hunting as threats to the survival of the remaining wild populations of great apes. Nevertheless, relatively little is known about the causative agents(1-3). We investigated an unusually high number of sudden deaths observed over nine months in three communities of wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) in the Tai National Park, Ivory Coast. Here we report combined pathological, cytological and molecular investigations that identified Bacillus anthracis as the cause of death for at least six individuals. We show that anthrax can be found in wild non-human primates living in a tropical rainforest, a habitat not previously known to harbour B. anthracis. Anthrax is an acute disease that infects ruminants(4,5), but other mammals, including humans, can be infected through contacting or inhaling high doses of spores or by consuming meat from infected animals(6). Respiratory and gastrointestinal anthrax are characterized by rapid onset, fever, septicaemia and a high fatality rate without early antibiotic treatment(6,7). Our results suggest that epidemic diseases represent substantial threats to wild ape populations, and through bushmeat consumption also pose a hazard to human health.

TI  - The use of drones for mosquito surveillance and control
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
AB  - In recent years, global health security has been threatened by the geographical expansion of vector-borne infectious diseases such as malaria, dengue, yellow fever, Zika and chikungunya. For a range of these vector-borne diseases, an increase in residual (exophagic) transmission together with ecological heterogeneity in everything from weather to local human migration and housing to mosquito species' behaviours presents many challenges to effective mosquito control. The novel use of drones (or uncrewed aerial vehicles) may play a major role in the success of mosquito surveillance and control programmes in the coming decades since the global landscape of mosquito-borne diseases and disease dynamics fluctuates frequently and there could be serious public health consequences if the issues of insecticide resistance and outdoor transmission are not adequately addressed. For controlling both aquatic and adult stages, for several years now remote sensing data have been used together with predictive modelling for risk, incidence and detection of transmission hot spots and landscape profiles in relation to mosquito-borne pathogens. The field of drone-based remote sensing is under continuous change due to new technology development, operation regulations and innovative applications. In this review we outline the opportunities and challenges for integrating drones into vector surveillance (i.e. identification of breeding sites or mapping micro-environmental composition) and control strategies (i.e. applying larval source management activities or deploying genetically modified agents) across the mosquito life-cycle. We present a five-step systematic environmental mapping strategy that we recommend be undertaken in locations where a drone is expected to be used, outline the key considerations for incorporating drone or other Earth Observation data into vector surveillance and provide two case studies of the advantages of using drones equipped with multispectral cameras. In conclusion, recent developments mean that drones can be effective for accurately conducting surveillance, assessing habitat suitability for larval and/or adult mosquitoes and implementing interventions. In addition, we briefly discuss the need to consider permissions, costs, safety/privacy perceptions and community acceptance for deploying drone activities.

TI  - CONSERVATION OF NEOTROPICAL HERPETOFAUNA: RESEARCH TRENDS AND CHALLENGES
T2  - TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE
AB  - The Neotropics harbor between 30-50% of the world's herpetofauna. However, little is known about the ecology and natural history of many species, making conservation strategies difficult to plan. After reviewing published papers on world herpetofauna conservation, it was shown that conservation biology has a low impact factor in scientific journals in comparison with other related disciplines such as evolutionary biology and ecology. Moreover, herpetology has one of the lowest impact factors within the biological sciences journals. The number of publications on amphibian and reptile conservation has increased in recent years; however, only 31% of the papers on herpetofaunal conservation have been published in high impact journals. There are many challenges to overcome in the conservation of the Neotropical herpetofauna. Uniform and stable taxonomic nomenclature is critical to avoid overestimation of species richness and diversity for conservation assessments, and in the context of legal proceedings. Herpetofaunal research needs to be conducted within the appropriate socio-political and economic framework, in order to effectively implement conservation area networks. It is important to reevaluate the role of protected area systems in ensuring the persistence of communities and populations, and to identify strategies and future conservation priorities, based on climate-change scenarios. Population and community studies at different spatial and temporal scales are necessary to understand herpetofauna responses to anthropogenic disturbances, habitat loss and fragmentation, edge and matrix effects, and their synergy with micro-climatic gradients, emergent diseases and shifting patterns of genetic diversity. One of the biggest challenges for herpetofaunal conservation science in the neotropics is to control habitat loss and increase landscape connectivity along altitudinal gradients, while at the same time control species invasion that alter native species' interactions and spread emergent diseases (e.g. Chytridiomycosis) facilitated by climate change.

TI  - Amazonian Forest Peoples' Perceptions of Malaria on the Upper Rio Negro, Brazil, are Shaped by Both Local and Scientific Knowledge
T2  - JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY
AB  - Malaria is endemic in Brazilian Amazonia, accounting for 99% of national cases. Amazonian forest peoples (both Indigenous and traditional) understand and treat the disease based on their knowledge, rituals, and religion. In recent decades, biomedical health coverage has expanded in the region, with implications for local perceptions and practices to prevent, treat, and recover from malaria. This paper attempts to understand how the expansion of biomedical healthcare among forest peoples interacts with their ethnomedicinal knowledge. Our results clearly indicate that most of our research participants in rural northwest Amazonia believe that malaria has a variety of causes, forms of prevention, and treatment. We also found that these beliefs are shaped by both local knowledge (including Indigenous) and some technical concepts of biomedicine. Consequently, new approaches and practices in healthcare need to be developed which consider forest peoples' perceptions and understanding.

TI  - Prediction of river water temperature using machine learning algorithms: a tropical river system of India
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROINFORMATICS
AB  - Machine learning (ML) has been increasingly adopted due to its ability to model complex and non-linearities between river water temperature (RWT) and its predictors (e.g., Air Temperature, AT). Most of these ML approaches have been applied using average AT without any detailed sensitivity analysis of other forms of AT (e.g., maximum and minimum). The present study demonstrates how new ML approaches, such as ridge regression (RR), K-nearest neighbors (KNN) regressor, random forest (RF) regressor, and support vector regression (SVR), can be coupled with Sobol' global sensitivity analysis (GSA) to predict accurate RWT estimates with the most appropriate form of AT. Furthermore, the proposed ML approaches have been combined with the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF), a data assimilation (DA) technique to improve the predicted values based on the measured data. The proposed modelling framework's effectiveness is demonstrated with a tropical river system of India, Tunga-Bhadra River, as a case study. The SVR has been noted as the most robust ML model to predict RWT at a monthly time scale compared with daily and seasonal. The study demonstrates how ML methods can be coupled with a global sensitivity algorithm and DA techniques to generate accurate RWT predictions in river water quality modelling.

TI  - Eco-epidemiological analysis of rickettsial seropositivity in rural areas of Colombia: A multilevel approach
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Rickettsiosis is a re-emergent infectious disease without epidemiological surveillance in Colombia. This disease is generally undiagnosed and several deadly outbreaks have been reported in the country in the last decade. The aim of this study is to analyze the eco-epidemiological aspects of rickettsial seropositivity in rural areas of Colombia where outbreaks of the disease were previously reported. A cross-sectional study, which included 597 people living in 246 households from nine hamlets in two municipalities of Colombia, was conducted from November 2015 to January 2016. The survey was conducted to collect sociodemographic and household characteristics (exposure) data. Blood samples were collected to determine the rickettsial seropositivity in humans, horses and dogs (IFA, cut-off = 1/128). In addition, infections by rickettsiae were detected in ticks from humans and animals by real-time PCR targeting gltA and ompA genes. Data was analyzed by weighted multilevel cloglog regression model using three levels (person, household and hamlets) and rickettsial seropositivity in humans was the main outcome. Overall prevalence of rickettsial seropositivity in humans was 25.62% (95% CI 22.11-29.12). Age in years (PR = 1.01 95% CI 1.01-1.02) and male sex (PR = 1.65 95% CI 1.43-1.90) were risk markers for rickettsial seropositivity. Working outdoors (PR = 1.20 95% CI 1.02-1.41), deforestation and forest fragmentation for agriculture use (PR = 1.75 95% CI 1.51-2.02), opossum in peridomiciliary area (PR = 1.56 95% CI 1.37-1.79) and a high proportion of seropositive domestic animals in the home (PR20-40% vs (<20%) = 2.28 95% CI 1.59-3.23 and PR>40% vs (<20%) = 3.14 95% CI 2.43-4.04) were associated with rickettsial seropositivity in humans. This study showed the presence of Rickettsia antibodies in human populations and domestic animals. In addition, different species of rickettsiae were detected in ticks collected from humans and animals. Our results at risk of transmission, and the importance of preventive measures aimed at curtailing deforestation and the fragmentation of forests as a way of reducing the risk of transmission of emergent and re-emergent pathogens.

TI  - Ecology of Phlebotomines (Diptera: Psychodidae) in a Transitional Area Between the Amazon and the Cerrado in the State of Maranhao, Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - The Amazon rainforest and the Brazilian Cerrado both possess high phlebotomine diversity. The fragmentation of these habitats has resulted in the appearance of human cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis. In one altered area of mixed primary vegetation (forest and Cerrado) and its adjacent settlement in the northeast state of Maranhao, Brazil, evidence exists for the active transmission of cutaneous leishmaniasis. Accordingly, an entomological investigation was performed in both the forest and the settlement to compare the phlebotomine vector fauna in each environment. The study was conducted from September 2009 to August 2010 in the municipality of Itapecuru Mirim in the state of Maranhao, Brazil. The phlebotomine species were captured using 24 light Center for Disease Control and Prevention traps that were placed in the forest and the settlement (peridomicile and intradomicile). The similarity between the phlebotomine compositions in the forest and those in the settlement was determined using a Principal Coordinate Analysis based on a dissimilarity matrix that was calculated using the Bray-Curtis index (relative abundance) and the Jaccard index (presence and absence of species). In total, 29 Lutzomyia species and one Brumptomyia species were collected. The phlebotomines were diverse and abundant in both the forest fragment (27 species, 4,606 specimens) and the settlement (22 species, 753 specimens). The most abundant species were L. infraspinosa (25%), L. davisi (21%), L. antunesi (21%), L. longipalpis (9%), L. saulensis (6%), L. flaviscutellata (5%), and L. wellcomei (4%). Some species were found strictly in the forest, other species were exclusive to the anthropic environment, and some species colonized both of the studied environments. The phlebotomines adaptation to these modified environments explains the autochthonous outbreak of cutaneous leishmaniasis.

TI  - Directions in tropical agroforestry research: Past, present, and future
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
CP  - Symposium on Tropical Agroforestry at the Annual Meeting of the American-Society-of-Agronomy
AB  - Reflections on the past two decades of organized research in tropical agroforestry raise several issues. Research efforts started with an inductive and experiential approach but have subsequently followed a deductive and experimental approach that includes hypothesis testing and the development of predictive capability; agroforestry research is thus being transformed into a rigorous scientific activity. The research agenda, so far, has given high priority to soil fertility and other biophysical interactions, less priority to anthropological and sociological aspects, and little priority to evaluating costs and returns, pests and diseases, and the so-called non-timber forest (tree) products. Moreover, larger-spatial-scale issues, such as carbon sequestration, water quality, and biodiversity conservation, have been neglected because of the emphasis on field- and farm-scale studies.
   Overall, the high expectations that were raised about the role and potential of agroforestry as a development vehicle have not been fulfilled. In order to overcome this, it is imperative that research be focused on the generation of appropriate, science-based technologies of wide applicability, especially under resource-poor conditions and in smallholder farming systems. Future research agendas should entail a judicious blending of science and technology. Applied research should build upon the findings of basic research to generate technologies for application at the farm, regional and global levels. Such research should place increased focus on previously neglected subjects, for example, the exploitation of indigenous fruit-producing trees, the agronomic components of agroforestry systems, and the global issues mentioned above. Furthermore, an appropriate methodology that embodies economic, social, and environmental costs and benefits needs to be developed to realistically assess the impacts of agroforestry, and an enabling policy environment that will facilitate agroforestry adoption needs to be made available.
   Agroforestry research of the 21st century should strive to build bridges from the inductive phase of the past, through the deductive phase of the present, to the future phase of harnessing science and generating technologies for the benefit of the land and its present and future users.

TI  - Seedling density dependence promotes coexistence of Bornean rain forest trees
T2  - ECOLOGY
AB  - Density-dependent processes may occur at various spatial scales and may be generated by, and influence, various life stages in a population. When evaluating evidence for density dependence relevant to species coexistence, the nature of forest communities leads logically to a focus on particular scales and life stages. We assessed evidence for the dependence of seedling survival on the abundance of conspecific trees and seedlings over both wide (150-ha) and local (0.16-ha and 1-m(2)) scales, in a species-rich Bornean rain forest. At the 150-ha scale, we identified a community-level compensatory trend in seedling survival (i.e., more abundant species had higher seedling mortality). There were parallel trends at the population level and on a local scale; seedling survival was inversely related to conspecific seedling density (in 1-m(2) quadrats) and tree basal area (in the surrounding 0.16 ha), for five out of 15 abundant species and for all species combined. As expected, seedlings of species with the highest adult abundance in 150 ha experienced the highest local densities of both conspecific seedlings and trees. Local density dependence in single-species analyses confirmed a dynamic interpretation of the community compensatory trend, i.e., that wide-scale seedling survival tends to decrease as a species' adult abundance increases. Taken together, our findings constitute strong evidence that density-dependent processes contribute to coexistence in this diverse rain forest community.

TI  - Optimal sampling frequency and timing of threatened tropical bird populations: A modeling approach
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
AB  - Conservation of threatened or endangered species relies critically on accurate population counts over time. In practice, many population censuses are conducted by non-governmental organizations or volunteer citizen scientists who are constrained by fiscal and temporal resources. Less than optimal sampling regimens (characterized by infrequent and/or irregular schedules) for conducting population censuses can result in woefully misleading population estimates and thus have dire consequences for management and conservation. We illustrate this using an East African case study in which 14 years of bird data was collected in the Arabuko-Sokoke Forest in coastal Kenya. We first estimate life history parameters in a discrete matrix model. Desiring a data collection protocol which would lessen observation error and lend to a deeper understanding of population projections and dynamics of a threatened species, we carry out mathematical and statistical modeling efforts with an adaptation of a Leslie model for simulated population estimates stemming from different population sampling schemes. We illustrate how resource managers might take a strategic approach, using simple quantitative models, to develop an optimal sampling scheme that considers important species traits, such as breeding season, and balances the tradeoff between resources and accuracy.

TI  - Optimal Combination of Predictors and Algorithms for Forest Above-Ground Biomass Mapping from Sentinel and SRTM Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Accurate forest above-ground biomass (AGB) mapping is crucial for sustaining forest management and carbon cycle tracking. The Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) and Sentinel satellite series offer opportunities for forest AGB monitoring. In this study, predictors filtered from 121 variables from Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR), Sentinal-2 multispectral instrument (MSI) and SRTM digital elevation model (DEM) data were composed into four groups and evaluated for their effectiveness in prediction of AGB. Five evaluated algorithms include linear regression such as stepwise regression (SWR) and geographically weighted regression (GWR); machine learning (ML) such as artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine for regression (SVR), and random forest (RF). The results showed that the RF model used predictors from both the Sentinel series and SRTM DEM performed the best, based on the independent validation set. The RF model achieved accuracy with the mean error, mean absolute error, root mean square error, and correlation coefficient in 1.39, 25.48, 61.11 Mgha(-1) and 0.9769, respectively. Texture characteristics, reflectance, vegetation indices, elevation, stream power index, topographic wetness index and surface roughness were recommended predictors for AGB prediction. Predictor variables were more important than algorithms for improving the accuracy of AGB estimates. The study demonstrated encouraging results in the optimal combination of predictors and algorithms for forest AGB mapping, using openly accessible and fine-resolution data based on RF algorithms.

TI  - Genetic structure of <i>Trypanosoma congolense</i> "forest type" circulating in domestic animals and tsetse flies in the South-West region of Cameroon
T2  - PARASITE
AB  - Despite the economic impact of trypanosome infections, few investigations have been undertaken on the population genetics and transmission dynamics of animal trypanosomes. In this study, microsatellite markers were used to investigate the population genetics of Trypanosoma congolense "forest type", with the ultimate goal of understanding its transmission dynamics between tsetse flies and domestic animals. Blood samples were collected from pigs, sheep, goats and dogs in five villages in Fontem, South-West region of Cameroon. In these villages, tsetse were captured, dissected and their mid-guts collected. DNA was extracted from blood and tsetse mid-guts and specific primers were used to identify T. congolense "forest type". All positive samples were genetically characterized with seven microsatellite markers. Genetic analyses were performed on samples showing single infections of T. congolense "forest type". Of the 299 blood samples, 137 (46%) were infected by T. congolense "forest type". About 3% (54/1596) of tsetse fly mid-guts were infected by T. congolense "forest type". Of 182 samples with T. congolense "forest type", 52 were excluded from the genetic analysis. The genetic analysis on the 130 remaining samples revealed polymorphism within and between subpopulations of the target trypanosome. The dendrogram of genetic similarities was subdivided into two clusters and three sub-clusters, indicating one major and several minor genotypes of T. congolense "forest type" in tsetse and domestic animals. The low FSTvalues suggest low genetic differentiation and no sub-structuration within subpopulations. The same T. congolense genotypes appear to circulate in tsetse and domestic animals.

TI  - Pathogen-associated selection on innate immunity genes (TLR4, TLR7) in a neotropical rodent in landscapes differing in anthropogenic disturbance
T2  - HEREDITY
AB  - Toll-like receptors (TLRs) form part of the innate immune system and can recognize structurally conserved pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) molecules. Their functional importance in the resistance to pathogens has been documented in laboratory experimental settings and in humans. TLR diversity, however, has been rarely investigated in wildlife species. How the genetic diversity of TLRs is associated with various pathogens and how it is shaped by habitat disturbance are understudied. Therefore, we investigated the role of genetic diversity in the functionally important parts of TLR4 and TLR7 genes in resistance towards gastrointestinal nematodes andHepacivirusinfection. We chose a generalist study species, the rodentProechimys semispinosus, because it is highly abundant in three Panamanian landscapes that differ in their degree of anthropogenic modification. We detected only two TLR7 haplotypes that differed by one synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) position. The TLR4 variability was higher, and we detected four TLR4 haplotypes that differed at one synonymous SNP and at three amino acid positions within the leucine-rich repeat region. Only TLR4 haplotypes had different frequencies in each landscape. Using generalized linear models, we found evidence that nematode loads and virus prevalence were influenced by both specific TLR4 haplotypes and landscape. Here, the variable "landscape" served as a surrogate for the important influential ecological factors distinguishing landscapes in our study, i.e. species diversity and host population density. Individuals carrying the common TLR4_Ht1 haplotype were less intensely infected by the most abundant strongyle nematode. Individuals carrying the rare TLR4_Ht3 haplotype were allHepacivirus-positive, where those carrying the rare haplotype TLR4_Ht4 were less often infected byHepacivirusthan individuals with other haplotypes. Our study highlights the role of TLR diversity in pathogen resistance and the importance of considering immune genetic as well as ecological factors in order to understand the effects of anthropogenic changes on wildlife health.

TI  - Dynamics of <i>Leishmania chagasi</i> infection in small mammals of the undisturbed and degraded tropical dry forests of northern Colombia
T2  - TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - The infection rate with Leishmania chagasi and the population dynamics of small mammals were studied in an undisturbed forest reserve (Coloso) and an area of highly degraded forest (San Andres de Sotavento [SAS]) in northern Colombia, both endemic for visceral leishmaniasis. Live trapping of mammals was done every month, and species, age, sex and reproductive status determined. L. chagasi was detected in samples of skin or spleen by the polymerase chain reaction, after extraction of deoxyribonucleic acid using specific primers (DB8/AJS3), and dot blood hybridization. Didelphis marsupialis was found to be infected in Coloso (3/21, 14 3%) and SAS (13/137, 9.5%); its relative abundance was higher in SAS (93/113, 82% of the captures). Although Proechimys canicollis was also found to be infected in Coloso (3/34, 8.8%) and SAS (2/4), its relative abundance was much lower (4%) in SAS than in Coloso (56% of 77 animals captured). Sciurus granatensis, Marmosa robinsoni, Heteromys a?anomalus, Zygodontomys brevicauda and Metachirus nudicaudatus were less common, and no L. chagasi infection was detected in them.

TI  - Cross-Sectional Survey of Rift Valley Fever Virus Exposure in Bodhei Village Located in a Transitional Coastal Forest Habitat in Lamu County, Kenya
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Few studies have focused on Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) transmission in less arid, transitional landscapes surrounding known high-risk regions. The objective of this study was to identify evidence of RVFV exposure in Bodhei Village in a forested area at the edge of the RVFV-epidemic Garissa region. In a household cluster-based survey conducted between epidemics in early 2006, 211 participants were enrolled. Overall seroprevalence for anti-RVFV was high (18%) and comparable with rates in the more arid, dense brush regions farther north. Seroprevalence of adults was 28%, whereas that of children was significantly lower (3%; P < 0.001); the youngest positive child was age 3 years. Males were more likely to be seropositive than females (25% versus 11%; P < 0.01), and animal husbandry activities (birthing, sheltering, and butchering) were strongly associated with seropositivity. The results confirm that significant RVFV transmission occurs outside of recognized high-risk areas and independent of known epidemic periods.

TI  - Fleas associated with sigmodontine rodents and marsupials from the Paranaense Forest in Northeastern Argentina
T2  - ACTA TROPICA
AB  - Fleas from the Paranaense Forest in northeastern Argentina are studied. Herein we provided a list of specimens identified, which includes host species and geographical distribution for each taxa, as well as some comments on the morphology, distribution and epidemiological importance when available. The following eight species and subspecies of fleas belonging to four families were identified: Ctenocephalides felis felis (Pulicidae), Craneopsylla minerva minerva (Stephanocircidae), Polygenis (Polygenis) platensis, Polygenis (Polygenis) roberti beebei, Polygenis (Neopolygenis) pradoi, Polygenis (Neopolygenis) pygaerus (Rhopalopsyllidae), Adoratopsylla (Adoratopsylla) antiquorum antiquorum, and Adoratopsylla (Tritopsylla) intermedia intermedia (Ctenophthalmidae). The results obtained increase to eleven the known diversity of fleas in the Argentinean Paranaense Forest area. Seven new flea host associations are reported for the first time. In addition, all the species and subspecies are mentioned for the first time for the province of Misiones. Besides, the results contribute to the knowledge of mammal ectoparasites and to their biodiversity of the Province, necessary to a better understanding of their role as parasites themselves and vectors of zoonotic importance.

TI  - Assessment of ALOS PALSAR 50 m Orthorectified FBD Data for Regional Land Cover Classification by Support Vector Machines
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
AB  - From its launch in 2006, the phased array L-band synthetic aperture radar (PALSAR) onboard the advanced land observing satellite (ALOS) has acquired many dual-polarized (FBD) images with a 70-km swath width, aiming to produce spatially consistent coverage over tropical rainforest. This paper investigates the relevancy of PALSAR orthorectified FBD product at 50-m resolution for regional land cover classification by the support vector machines (SVM). Our test site is the Riau province, Sumatra island, Indonesia, known to hold vast area of natural peatland forest with an extreme biodiversity threatened by industrial deforestation. Since it is demonstrated the radiometric information (HH and HV channels) cannot be solely used to achieve a good classification, the spatial information in these orthorectified data is investigated. A new tool using the recursive feature elimination SVM-based process and the textural Haralick's parameters is introduced. The real contribution of textures within the land cover classification can be understood. A small set of textural parameters is determined at local scale while being optimal for the land cover discrimination. The SVM-based classifier is carried out across the whole Riau province and its results are compared with a Landsat-based estimation. The agreement is over 70% with six classes and 86% for the natural forest map. These results are remarkable since only one PALSAR FBD product is used and this assessment is performed on more than 40 million pixels. The results confirm the high potential of the PALSAR sensor for forest monitoring at regional, if not global scale.

TI  - Virome of Three Termite Species from Southern Vietnam
T2  - VIRUSES-BASEL
AB  - Modern metagenomic approaches enable the effective discovery of novel viruses in previously unexplored organisms. Termites are significant ecosystem converters and influencers. As with the majority of tropical forest insects, termites are studied insufficiently, and termite virome remains especially understudied. Here, we studied the virome of lichenophagous and mycophagous termites (Hospitalitermes bicolor, Macrotermes carbonarius and Odontotermes wallonensis) collected in the Cat Tien National Park (Vietnam). We assembled four full genomes of novel viruses related to Solemoviridae, Lispiviridae, Polycipiviridae and Kolmioviridae. We also found several contigs with relation to Chuviridae and Deltaflexiviridae that did not correspond to complete virus genomes. All the novel viruses clustered phylogenetically with previously identified viruses of the termites. Deltaflexi-like contigs were identified in the fungi-cultivating M. carbonarius and showed homology with viruses recently discovered in the edible basidiomycete mushrooms.

TI  - Mosquito Fauna and Spatial Distribution in an Atlantic Forest Area in Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil, Reveal a High Risk of Transmission of Yellow Fever and Other Arboviruses
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE
AB  - In 2017-2019, Brazil recorded its most severe outbreak of yellow fever due to the spread of the virus (YFV) in the country's southeast. Here, we investigated mosquito fauna and the spatial distribution of species in a primatology center in the Atlantic Forest bioregion in Rio de Janeiro state to evaluate the risk of YFV transmission in distinct environments. Fortnightly mosquito collections were performed from December 2018 to December 2019 at 12 sites along a disturbance gradient from a modified environment to 400 m inside the forest. We used ovitraps, BG-Sentinel, and protected human attraction (PHA). A total of 9349 mosquitoes of 21 species were collected. The collection method strongly influenced the captured fauna, with species such as Anopheles cruzii, Psorophora ferox, Runchomyia cerqueirai, Wyeomyia incaudata, Wy. theobaldi, Sabethes chloropterus, and Sa. albiprivus only collected via PHA. Collections with ovitraps resulted in low diversity and richness, with Haemagogus leucocelaenus and Hg. janthinomys/capricornii predominating. The diverse local fauna and the abundance and ubiquity of the latter species, which are the primary vectors of YFV, indicated that this area was highly vulnerable to arbovirus transmission, especially yellow fever, highlighting the need for improved surveillance and vaccination coverage in human and captive endangered non-human primates.

TI  - BoHV-4-Based Vector Single Heterologous Antigen Delivery Protects STAT1<SUP>(-/-)</SUP> Mice from Monkeypoxvirus Lethal Challenge
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Monkeypox virus (MPXV) is the etiological agent of human (MPX). It is an emerging orthopox-virus zoonosis in the tropical rain forest of Africa and is endemic in the Congo-basin and sporadic in West Africa; it remains a tropical neglected disease of persons in impoverished rural areas. Interaction of the human population with wildlife increases human infection with MPX virus (MPXV), and infection from human to human is possible. Smallpox vaccination provides good cross-protection against MPX; however, the vaccination campaign ended in Africa in 1980, meaning that a large proportion of the population is currently unprotected against MPXV infection. Disease control hinges on deterring zoonotic exposure to the virus and, barring that, interrupting person-to-person spread. However, there are no FDA-approved therapies against MPX, and current vaccines are limited due to safety concerns. For this reason, new studies on pathogenesis, prophylaxis and therapeutics are still of great interest, not only for the scientific community but also for the governments concerned that MPXV could be used as a bioterror agent. In the present study, a new vaccination strategy approach based on three recombinant bovine herpesvirus 4 (BoHV-4) vectors, each expressing different MPXV glycoproteins, A29L, M1R and B6R were investigated in terms of protection from a lethal MPXV challenge in STAT1 knockout mice. BoHV-4-A-CMV-A29LgD(106)Delta TK, BoHV-4A-EF1 alpha-M1RgD(106)Delta TK and BoHV-4-A-EF1 alpha-B6RgD(106)Delta TK were successfully constructed by recombineering, and their capacity to express their transgene was demonstrated. A small challenge study was performed, and all three recombinant BoHV-4 appeared safe (no weight-loss or obvious adverse events) following intraperitoneal administration. Further, BoHV-4-AEF1 alpha-M1RgD(106)Delta TK alone or in combination with BoHV-4-A-CMV-A29LgD(106)Delta TK and BoHV-4-A-EF1 alpha-B6RgD(106)Delta TK, was shown to be able to protect, 100% alone and 80% in combination, STAT1((-/-)) mice against mortality and morbidity. This work demonstrated the efficacy of BoHV-4 based vectors and the use of BoHV-4 as a vaccine-vector platform.

TI  - Mapping of the Susceptibility of Colombian Musaceae Lands to a Deadly Disease: <i>Fusarium oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>cubense</i> Tropical Race 4
T2  - HORTICULTURAE
AB  - Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense Tropical Race 4 (Foc TR4) (Syn. Fusarium odoratissimum) is a devastating soil-borne pathogen that infects the roots of banana plants and causes Fusarium wilt disease. Colombia is one of the world's leading banana producers; therefore, new uncontrolled outbreaks could have serious consequences. Despite this, little is known about the susceptibility of Musaceae lands in Colombia to Foc TR4. This work presents a pioneering study on the susceptibility of Colombian soils to Foc TR4. For this, a study was carried out to characterize climatic, edaphic, and density factors of Musaceae productive systems at the Colombian level, articulated with expert criteria to map and define areas with different levels of susceptibility to Foc R4T. These criteria are typically selected based on the existing scientific literature, consultation with domain experts, and consideration of established methods for assessing soil health and disease susceptibility in Musaceae plantations. By joining the analyzed susceptibility factors, differentiated areas were generated that imply a greater or lesser predisposition to the disease. Subsequently, a validation of the classification was made with Random Forest. The results indicate that at the level of climate, soil, and farm density as a fit factor, practically 50% of the cultivated territory of Musaceae are areas high and very highly susceptible to the pathogen (572,000 km(2)). The results showed that from the total Musaceae area, Antioquia, Bolivar, Choco, and Santander turned out to be the departments with the highest proportion of very high susceptibility class of the production farms. The analysis of Random Forest classification performance shows that the model has a relatively low out-of-bag (OOB) error rate (0.023). The study on the susceptibility is highly novel and original, as it represents the first systematic investigation of Foc TR4 susceptibility in Colombian soils. This paper provides important insights into the susceptibility of Musaceae lands in Colombia to Foc TR4. The study highlights the need for ongoing monitoring, containment, and control measures to prevent the spread of this deadly pathogen and protect Colombia's important banana industry.

TI  - A Legacy of Low-Impact Logging does not Elevate Prevalence of Potentially Pathogenic Protozoa in Free-Ranging Gorillas and Chimpanzees in the Republic of Congo: Logging and Parasitism in African Apes
T2  - ECOHEALTH
AB  - Many studies have examined the long-term effects of selective logging on the abundance and diversity of free-ranging primates. Logging is known to reduce the abundance of some primate species through associated hunting and the loss of food trees for frugivores; however, the potential role of pathogens in such primate population declines is largely unexplored. Selective logging results in a suite of alterations in host ecology and forest structure that may alter pathogen dynamics in resident wildlife populations. In addition, environmental pollution with human fecal material may present a risk for wildlife infections with zoonotic protozoa, such as Cryptosporidium and Giardia. To better understand this interplay, we compared patterns of infection with these potentially pathogenic protozoa in sympatric western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) and chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) in the undisturbed Goualougo Triangle of Nouabal,-Ndoki National Park and the adjacent previously logged Kabo Concession in northern Republic of Congo. No Cryptosporidium infections were detected in any of the apes examined and prevalence of infection with Giardia was low (3.73% overall) and did not differ between logged and undisturbed forest for chimpanzees or gorillas. These results provide a baseline for prevalence of these protozoa in forest-dwelling African apes and suggest that low-intensity logging may not result in long-term elevated prevalence of potentially pathogenic protozoa.

TI  - Multilevel decomposition of spatial and environmental effects on nearshore fish assemblages in tropical semi-enclosed ecosystems
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
AB  - We investigated the effects of local- and landscape-scale environmental variables and spatial structure at three hierarchical levels (i.e. type of system, individual systems, and zones within each system) on the fish species composition and abundance in bays and coastal lagoons in southeastern Brazil. The effects were assessed at the assemblage level, and between and within habitat use groups. Exclusive and shared effects of environmental, hierarchical, and spatial variable sets were quantified by variation partitioning, and individual environmental effects were assessed by partial canonical correspondence analyses. The hierarchical and spatial structures were more relevant for habitat use groups less widespread due to the lower dependence on estuarine areas, and influenced primarily the landscape-scale environmental differences between individual systems. At the assemblage level, the exclusively environmental effects were primarily indicative of the marine (e.g., higher depth, pH, and transparency) versus continental (e.g., greater distance from the ocean and mangrove cover) influence. Estuarine, marine migrant, and marine straggler species were more widespread across these gradients, but the former species were primarily associated with greater mangrove cover and the marine stragglers with a higher marine influence. Semi-diadromous and freshwater species were less associated with greater mangrove cover and primarily restricted to coastal lagoons. The different multi-scale environmental effects within each group reinforced the relevance of intra- and inter-specific differences in environmental tolerances and requirements, and evidenced the relevance of the connectivity between alternative habitats in maintaining the structure of fish assemblages. Disentangling multilevel spatial and environmental effects, this study evidenced the critical roles of the maintenance of the environmental heterogeneity in nearby estuarine habitats for nearshore fish assemblages in different types of tropical semi-enclosed estuarine ecosystems.

TI  - Estimation and Mapping of Forest Structure Parameters from Open Access Satellite Images: Development of a Generic Method with a Study Case on Coniferous Plantation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Temperate forests are under climatic and economic pressures. Public bodies, NGOs and the wood industry are looking for accurate, current and affordable data driven solutions to intensify wood production while maintaining or improving long term sustainability of the production, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. Free tools and open access data have already been exploited to produce accurate quantitative forest parameters maps suitable for policy and operational purposes. These efforts have relied on different data sources, tools, and methods that are tailored for specific forest types and climatic conditions. We hypothesized we could build on these efforts in order to produce a generic method suitable to perform as well or better in a larger range of settings. In this study we focus on building a generic approach to create forest parameters maps and confirm its performance on a test site: a maritime pine (Pinus pinaster) forest located in south west of France. We investigated and assessed options related with the integration of multiple data sources (SAR L- and C-band, optical indexes and spatial texture indexes from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and ALOS-PALSAR-2), feature extraction, feature selection and machine learning techniques. On our test case, we found that the combination of multiple open access data sources has synergistic benefits on the forest parameters estimates. The sensibility analysis shows that all the data participate to the improvements, that reach up to 13.7% when compared to single source estimates. Accuracy of the estimates is as follows: aboveground biomass (AGB) 28% relative RMSE, basal area (BA) 27%, diameter at breast height (DBH) 20%, age 17%, tree density 24%, and height 13%. Forward feature selection and SVR provided the best estimates. Future work will focus on validating this generic approach in different settings. It may prove beneficial to package the method, the tools, and the integration of open access data in order to make spatially accurate and regularly updated forest structure parameters maps effortlessly available to national bodies and forest organizations.

TI  - Evaluation of RISAT-1 SAR data for tropical forestry applications
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
AB  - India launched C band (5.35 GEL) RISAT-1 (Radar Imaging Satellite-1) on 26th April, 2012, equipped with the capability to image the Earth at multiple-resolutions and-polarizations. In this study the potential of Fine Resolution Strip (FRS) modes of RISAT-1 was evaluated for characterization and classification forests and estimation of biomass of early growth stages. The study was carried out at the two sites located in the foothills of western Himalaya, India. The pre-processing and classification of FRS-1 SAR data was performed using PolSAR Pro ver. 5.0 software. The scattering mechanisms derived from m-chi decomposition of FRS-1 RH/RV data were found physically meaningful for the characterization of various surface features types. The forest and land use type classification of the study area was developed applying Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm on FRS-1 derived appropriate polarimetric features. The biomass of early growth stages of Eucalyptus (up to 60 ton/ha) was estimated developing a multi-linear regression model using C band a HV and sigma(0) HH backscatter information. The study outcomes has promise for wider application of RISAT-1 data for forest cover monitoring, especially for the tropical regions. (C) 2016 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Post-lockdown spread of COVID-19 from cities to vulnerable forest-fringe villages in Central India
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
AB  - Seasonal migration to cities is a common livelihood strategy for forest-fringe households in central India. Based on a previously collected household survey of 5000 villages across 500 forest-fringe villages in 32 districts of central India, we identify migration patterns over the last 5 years. Villages with seasonal workers are widely dispersed (75% of surveyed villages) and 81% of destination cities had reported COVID-19 cases at the beginning of the lockdown. Using a disease spread model to assess distancing strategies if returning migrants carry the virus to villages, we find that lenient restrictions for people within a village combined with maximal restrictions between villages could reduce the number of people exposed compared with moderate restrictions both within and between villages. Such a 'village bubble' strategy could reduce the risk of spread among vulnerable populations and requires that essential goods reach villages.

TI  - Detection of <i>Leptospira interrogans</i> in Wild Sambar Deer (<i>Rusa unicolor</i>), Brazil
T2  - ECOHEALTH
AB  - Leptospirosis is an emerging zoonotic disease caused by bacteria of the genus Leptospira. Wild animals may present acute disease or become chronic hosts. The present study aimed to identify Leptospira spp. infection and determine circulating serogroups in free-ranging sambar deer (Rusa unicolor) in a fragment of peri-urban tropical forest in northeastern Brazil. Blood samples were collected and subjected to microscopic agglutination testing (MAT) and PCR analysis (genes lipL32 and secY). Anti-Leptospira antibodies were detected in 60% of the animals tested, with serogroups Cynopteri (33.4%), Hebdomadis (22.2%) and Grippotyphosa (22.2%) identified as most prevalent. DNA corresponding to the pathogenic species Leptospira interrogans was detected in 2/15 (13.3%) of the samples tested. Sambar deer experience a high level of exposure to Leptospira spp. in our epidemiological setting. It is important to emphasize the implementation of effective measures (i.e., maintaining habitats and reducing human contact) for the conservation of endangered species.

TI  - Mating system and early viability resistance to habitat fragmentation in a bird-pollinated eucalypt
T2  - HEREDITY
AB  - Habitat fragmentation has been shown to disrupt ecosystem processes such as plant-pollinator mutualisms. Consequently, mating patterns in remnant tree populations are expected to shift towards increased inbreeding and reduced pollen diversity, with fitness consequences for future generations. However, mating patterns and phenotypic assessments of open-pollinated progeny have rarely been combined in a single study. Here, we collected seeds from 37 Eucalyptus incrassata trees from contrasting stand densities following recent clearance in a single South Australian population (intact woodland = 12.6 trees ha(-1); isolated pasture = 1.7 trees ha(-1); population area = 10 km(2)). 649 progeny from these trees were genotyped at eight microsatellite loci. We estimated genetic diversity, spatial genetic structure, indirect contemporary pollen flow and mating patterns for adults older than the clearance events and open-pollinated progeny sired post-clearance. A proxy of early stage progeny viability was assessed in a common garden experiment. Density had no impact on mating patterns, adult and progeny genetic diversity or progeny growth, but was associated with increased mean pollen dispersal. Weak spatial genetic structure among adults suggests high historical gene flow. We observed preliminary evidence for inbreeding depression related to stress caused by fungal infection, but which was not associated with density. Higher observed heterozygosities in adults compared with progeny may relate to weak selection on progeny and lifetime-accumulated mortality of inbred adults. E. incrassata appears to be resistant to the negative mating pattern and fitness changes expected within fragmented landscapes. This pattern is likely explained by strong outcrossing and regular long-distance pollen flow.

TI  - Toward Causal Inference for Spatio-Temporal Data: Conflict and Forest Loss in Colombia
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION
AB  - How does armed conflict influence tropical forest loss? For Colombia, both enhancing and reducing effect estimates have been reported. However, a lack of causal methodology has prevented establishing clear causal links between these two variables. In this work, we propose a class of causal models for spatio-temporal stochastic processes which allows us to formally define and quantify the causal effect of a vector of covariates X on a real-valued response Y. We introduce a procedure for estimating causal effects and a nonparametric hypothesis test for these effects being zero. Our application is based on geospatial information on conflict events and remote-sensing-based data on forest loss between 2000 and 2018 in Colombia. Across the entire country, we estimate the effect to be slightly negative (conflict reduces forest loss) but insignificant (P = 0.578), while at the provincial level, we find both positive effects (e.g., La Guajira, P = 0.047) and negative effects (e.g., Magdalena, P = 0.004). The proposed methods do not make strong distributional assumptions, and allow for arbitrarily many latent confounders, given that these confounders do not vary across time. Our theoretical findings are supported by simulations, and code is available online.

TI  - Reducing Uncertainty for Acute Febrile Illness in Resource-Limited Settings: The Current Diagnostic Landscape
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Diagnosing the cause of acute febrile illness in resource-limited settings is important-to give the correct antimicrobials to patients who need them, to prevent unnecessary antimicrobial use, to detect emerging infectious diseases early, and to guide vaccine deployment. A variety of approaches are yielding more rapid and accurate tests that can detect more pathogens in a wider variety of settings. After decades of slow progress in diagnostics for acute febrile illness in resource-limited settings, a wave of converging advancements will enable clinicians in resource-limited settings to reduce uncertainty for the diagnosis of acute febrile illness.

TI  - Tick Microbiomes in Neotropical Forest Fragments Are Best Explained by Tick-Associated and Environmental Factors Rather than Host Blood Source
T2  - APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - The composition of tick microbiomes varies both within and among tick species. Whether this variation is intrinsic (related to tick characteristics) or extrinsic (related to vertebrate host and habitat) is poorly understood but important, as microbiota can influence the reproductive success and vector competence of ticks. We aimed to uncover what intrinsic and extrinsic factors best explain the microbial composition and taxon richness of 11 species of neotropical ticks collected from eight species of small mammals in 18 forest fragments across central Panama. Microbial richness varied among tick species, life stages, and collection sites but was not related to host blood source. Microbiome composition was best explained by tick life stage, with bacterial assemblages of larvae being a subset of those of nymphs. Collection site explained most of the bacterial taxa with differential abundance across intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Francisella and Rickettsia were highly prevalent, but their proportional abundance differed greatly among tick species, and we found both positive and negative cooccurrence between members of these two genera. Other tick endosymbionts (e.g., Coxiella and Rickettsiella) were associated with specific tick species. In addition, we detected Anaplasma and Bartonella in several tick species. Our results indicate that the microbial composition and richness of neotropical ticks are principally related to intrinsic factors (tick species and life stage) and collection site. Taken together, our analysis informs how tick microbiomes are structured and can help anchor our understanding of tick microbiomes from tropical environments more broadly.
   IMPORTANCE Blood-feeding arthropod microbiomes often play important roles in disease transmission, yet the factors that structure tick microbial communities in the Neotropics are unknown. Utilizing ticks collected from live animals in neotropical forest fragments, this study teases apart the contributions of intrinsic and extrinsic tick-associated factors on tick microbial composition as well as which specific microbes contribute to differences across tick species, tick life stages, the mammals they fed on, and the locations from where they were sampled. Furthermore, this study provides revelations of how notable tick-associated bacterial genera are interacting with other tick-associated microbes as well as the forest animals they encounter.

TI  - Satellite and Machine Learning Monitoring of Optically Inactive Water Quality Variability in a Tropical River
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Large-scale monitoring of water quality parameters (WQPs) is one of the most critical issues for protecting and managing water resources. However, monitoring optically inactive WQPs, such as total nitrogen (TN), ammoniacal nitrogen (AN), and total phosphorus (TP) in inland waters, is still challenging. This study constructed retrieval models to explore the spatiotemporal evolution of TN, AN, and TP by Landsat 8 images, water quality sampling, and five machine learning algorithms (support vector regression, SVR; random forest regression, RFR; artificial neural networks, ANN; regression tree, RT; and gradient boosting machine, GBM) in the Nandu River downstream (NRD), a tropical river in China. The results indicated that these models can effectively monitor TN, AN, and TP concentrations at in situ sites. In particular, TN by RFR as well as AN and TP by ANN had better accuracy, in which the R-2 value ranged between 0.44 and 0.67, and the RMSE was 0.03-0.33 mg/L in the testing dataset. The spatial distribution of TN, AN, and TP was seasonal in NRD from 2013-2022. TN and AN should be paid more attention to in normal wet seasons of urban and agricultural zones, respectively. TP, however, should be focus on in the normal season of agricultural zones. Temporally, AN decreased significantly in the normal and wet seasons while the others showed little change. These results could provide a large-scale spatial overview of the water quality, find the sensitive areas and periods of water pollution, and assist in identifying and controlling the non-point source pollution in the NRD. This study demonstrated that multispectral remote sensing and machine learning algorithms have great potential for monitoring optically inactive WQPs in tropical large-scale inland rivers.

TI  - A novel approach to the classification of regional-scale radar mosaics for tropical vegetation mapping
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
AB  - The Global Rain Forest Mapping (GRFM) radar mosaics, generated from L-band Japanese Earth Resources Satellite 1 imagery downsampled to 100-m pixel size, provide a two-season spatially continuous coverage of the humid tropical ecosystems of the world. This paper presents a novel classification approach suitable for regional-scale vegetation mapping using the GRFM datasets. The mapping system consists of: 1) an application-dependent wavelet-based edge-preserving smoothing algorithm and 2) a two-stage per-pixel hybrid learning nearest multiple-prototype (NMP) classifier, whose unsupervised first stage is a per-pixel-near-optimal vector quantizer, called enhanced Linde-Buzo-Gray (ELBG), recently proposed in pattern recognition literature. Identified as ENMP (NMP with ELBG), this novel classification approach is compared against two alternative systems in the classification of forest cover disturbances located across an area in the Amazon Basin. Surface classes of interest are primary forest, degraded forest, nonforest, and water bodies. Reference maps, derived from 30-m resolution Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery, are provided by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Abundant quantitative and qualitative evidence shows that: 1) in a forest/nonforest data-mapping task, ENMP provides a testing accuracy of 87%, in line with training accuracies, i.e., the proposed method seems capable of generalizing well over the GRIM South America dataset and 2) among three competing approaches, ENMP provides the best compromise between ease of use, mapping accuracy, and computational time. Starting from these results, ENMP is employed to generate a swamp forest map of the whole Amazon Basin from the two-season GRFM radar mosaic of South America, in the context of the Global Land Cover project (GLC 2000).

TI  - An ecological niche model to predict the geographic distribution of <i>Haemagogus janthinomys</i>, Dyar, 1921 a yellow fever and Mayaro virus vector, in South America
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Yellow fever virus (YFV) has a long history of impacting human health in South America. Mayaro virus (MAYV) is an emerging arbovirus of public health concern in the Neotropics and its full impact is yet unknown. Both YFV and MAYV are primarily maintained via a sylvatic transmission cycle but can be opportunistically transmitted to humans by the bites of infected forest dwelling Haemagogus janthinomys Dyar, 1921. To better understand the potential risk of YFV and MAYV transmission to humans, a more detailed understanding of this vector species' distribution is critical. This study compiled a comprehensive database of 177 unique Hg. janthinomys collection sites retrieved from the published literature, digitized museum specimens and publicly accessible mosquito surveillance data. Covariate analysis was performed to optimize a selection of environmental (topographic and bioclimatic) variables associated with predicting habitat suitability, and species distributions modelled across South America using a maximum entropy (MaxEnt) approach. Our results indicate that suitable habitat for Hg. janthinomys can be found across forested regions of South America including the Atlantic forests and interior Amazon.
   Author summary
   Mayaro virus is a neglected tropical disease and there is insufficient evidence to define its geographic range. The mosquito Haemagogus janthinomys is a primary vector of Mayaro and its distribution is largely unknown at a sub-country scale. Building compendiums of collection data and creating ecological niche models provides a more precise estimation of vector species potential habitat. Our dataset stands as one of the most expansive existing for collection data of this species combining data published in literature, publicly available data repositories and digitized museum specimen records. Comparing results of niche models with near real time environmental data can give even better predictions of areas where Mayaro virus exposure could occur. The methods and results of this study can be replicated for any disease/vector of interest so long as there is data discoverable through the scientific literature, public repositories, or other civilian and governmental agencies willing to share.

TI  - Phlebotomine sand fly species co-occurrence at the local scale: Differences between agricultural and forested areas
T2  - BOLETIN DE MALARIOLOGIA Y SALUD AMBIENTAL
AB  - Phlebotomine sand flies (Diptera: Psychodidae: Phlebotominae) are vectors of Leishmania parasites, etiological agents of leishmaniases in humans and other mammals worldwide. A previous study showed that at large biogeographical scales sand fly patterns of co-occurrence are segregated, indicating that sand fly communities at such scales are likely shaped by environmental factors and interspecific interactions. However, no study has addressed co-occurrence patterns at the local scale of disease transmission. Here, a null-model analysis of species co-occurrence patterns is presented, showing that at the local scale patterns of sand fly species co-occurrence shift from a segregated structure to random when comparing a forest to a farmland. These patterns may explain the ecological fitting of sand flies with regard to the choice of diurnal resting sites in transformed landscapes, which may impact the transmission of Leishmania parasites by disrupting patterns of blood foraging across vertebrate hosts.

TI  - Signatures of functional bacteriome structure in a tropical direct-developing amphibian species
T2  - ANIMAL MICROBIOME
AB  - Background Host microbiomes may differ under the same environmental conditions and these differences may influence susceptibility to infection. Amphibians are ideal for comparing microbiomes in the context of disease defense because hundreds of species face infection with the skin-invading microbe Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), and species richness of host communities, including their skin bacteria (bacteriome), may be exceptionally high. We conducted a landscape-scale Bd survey of six co-occurring amphibian species in Brazil's Atlantic Forest. To test the bacteriome as a driver of differential Bd prevalence, we compared bacteriome composition and co-occurrence network structure among the six focal host species. Results Intensive sampling yielded divergent Bd prevalence in two ecologically similar terrestrial-breeding species, a group with historically low Bd resistance. Specifically, we detected the highest Bd prevalence in Ischnocnema henselii but no Bd detections in Haddadus binotatus. Haddadus binotatus carried the highest bacteriome alpha and common core diversity, and a modular network partitioned by negative co-occurrences, characteristics associated with community stability and competitive interactions that could inhibit Bd colonization. Conclusions Our findings suggest that community structure of the bacteriome might drive Bd resistance in H. binotatus, which could guide microbiome manipulation as a conservation strategy to protect diverse radiations of direct-developing species from Bd-induced population collapses.

TI  - Mange epizootic in white-nosed coatis in western Mexico
T2  - JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE DISEASES
AB  - From November of 1994 to June of 1996 an epizootic of mange, probably caused by the mite Notoedres cati, occurred in white-nosed coatis (Nasua narica) in the tropical dry forests of the Chamela-Cuixmala Biosphere Reserve in western Mexico. A monitoring scheme to deter-mine the extent and severity of the epizootic within coatis was implemented. Trapping periods and transects were conducted for 2 yr. To control the spread of the disease, all captured infected coatis were either euthanized or treated with acaricides such as Butox(R) and Ivomec-F(R), depending on the severity of their infection. Four other species of wild mammals and feral cats had skin conditions resembling mange A more severe problem with the disease of predicted. results indicate that epizootics may be more prone to occur in areas with greater fragmentation and less isolation from anthropogenic influence. interestingly, although there was an apparently severe impact of the mange epizootic in the coati population, the long-term impact of the disease is unknown but appears to be negligible. So in order to understand the role of diseases in wildlife populations, long-term experimental studies are required.

TI  - Landscape-scale survey of non-native fishes near ornamental aquaculture facilities in Florida, USA
T2  - BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS
AB  - The Tampa Bay region of Florida exhibits the highest concentration of ornamental aquaculture facilities in the USA. Because of the diversity of aquaculture products (similar to 800 species and varieties) and extensive production history (began in the 1930s and 1940s), this region could be a hotspot for escaped ornamental fish. We evaluated the scope of ornamental fish invasions in this region by examining (1) escape vectors and (2) the distribution of escaped fish. We investigated potential pathways of fish escape including theft/vandalism, fish transport, bird carry-off, and through effluent discharge. Fish were sampled at the effluent discharge and continued into the surrounding environment. The dominant escape vector was through farm effluents; there was no evidence that theft/vandalism, fish transport, or bird carry-off contributed to fish escape. Most captured fish were natives, especially the ubiquitous Eastern Mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki). Ornamental species and varieties were also captured, especially cichlids and poeciliids such as the Green Swordtail (Xiphophorus hellerii) and Southern Platyfish (Xiphophorus maculatus). Ornamental fish were often found in the immediate vicinity of fish farms but were rarely captured in the surrounding environment. Catch per unit effort and ornamental fish diversity declined when moving away from the aquaculture facility effluent and was reduced at sites with a detention pond. The observed fish distribution might be due to relatively cold water in sub-tropical Florida, predatory fish in the environment, and additional factors related to the physical or biological habitat. Ultimately, few ornamental fishes have established in this region despite a long period of extensive culture.

TI  - Plant Growth Promotion and Biocontrol by Endophytic and Rhizospheric Microorganisms From the Tropics: A Review and Perspectives
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
AB  - Currently, the tropics harbor a wide variety of crops to feed the global population. Rapid population expansion and the consequent major demand for food and agriculture-based products generate initiatives for tropical forest deforestation, which contributes to land degradation and the loss of macro and micronative biodiversity of ecosystems. Likewise, the entire dependence on fertilizers and pesticides also contributes to negative impacts on environmental and human health. To guarantee current and future food safety, as well as natural resource preservation, systems for sustainable crops in the tropics have attracted substantial attention worldwide. Therefore, the use of beneficial plant-associated microorganisms is a promising sustainable way to solve issues concerning modern agriculture and the environment. Efficient strains of bacteria and fungi are a rich source of natural products that might improve crop yield in numerous biological ways, such as nitrogen fixation, hormone production, mobilization of insoluble nutrients, and mechanisms related to plant biotic and abiotic stress alleviation. Additionally, these microorganisms also exhibit great potential for the biocontrol of phytopathogens and pest insects. This review addresses research regarding endophytic and rhizospheric microorganisms associated with tropical plants as a sustainable alternative to control diseases and enhance food production to minimize ecological damage in tropical ecosystems.

TI  - Spatio-temporal Patterns and Landscape-Associated Risk of Buruli Ulcer in Akonolinga, Cameroon
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background: Buruli ulcer (BU) is an extensively damaging skin infection caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans, whose transmission mode is still unknown. The focal distribution of BU and the absence of interpersonal transmission suggest a major role of environmental factors, which remain unidentified. This study provides the first description of the spatio-temporal variations of BU in an endemic African region, in Akonolinga, Cameroon. We quantify landscape-associated risk of BU, and reveal local patterns of endemicity.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: From January 2002 to May 2012, 787 new BU cases were recorded in 154 villages of the district of Akonolinga. Incidence per village ranged from 0 (n = 59 villages) to 10.4 cases/1000 person. years (py); median incidence was 0.4 cases/1,000py. Villages neighbouring the Nyong River flood plain near Akonolinga town were identified as the highest risk zone using the SPODT algorithm. We found a decreasing risk with increasing distance to the Nyong and identified 4 time phases with changes in spatial distribution. We classified the villages into 8 groups according to landscape characteristics using principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering. We estimated the incidence ratio (IR) associated with each landscape using a generalised linear model. BU risk was highest in landscapes with abundant wetlands, especially cultivated ones (IR = 15.7, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 15.7[4.2-59.2]), and lowest in reference landscape where primary and secondary forest cover was abundant. In intermediate-risk landscapes, risk decreased with agriculture pressure (from IR[95% CI] = 7.9[2.2-28.8] to 2.0[0.6-6.6]). We identified landscapes where endemicity was stable and landscapes where incidence increased with time.
   Conclusion/Significance: Our study on the largest series of BU cases recorded in a single endemic region illustrates the local evolution of BU and identifies the Nyong River as the major driver of BU incidence. Local differences along the river are explained by wetland abundance and human modification of the environment.

TI  - Evolution of Nipah Virus Infection: Past, Present, and Future Considerations
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE
AB  - Nipah virus (NiV) is a zoonotic paramyxovirus of the Henipavirus genus first identified in Malaysia in 1998. Henipaviruses have bat reservoir hosts and have been isolated from fruit bats found across Oceania, Asia, and Africa. Bat-to-human transmission is thought to be the primary mode of human NiV infection, although multiple intermediate hosts are described. Human infections with NiV were originally described as a syndrome of fever and rapid neurological decline following contact with swine. More recent outbreaks describe a syndrome with prominent respiratory symptoms and human-to-human transmission. Nearly annual outbreaks have been described since 1998 with case fatality rates reaching greater than 90%. The ubiquitous nature of the reservoir host, increasing deforestation, multiple mode of transmission, high case fatality rate, and lack of effective therapy or vaccines make NiV's pandemic potential increasingly significant. Here we review the epidemiology and microbiology of NiV as well as the therapeutic agents and vaccines in development.

TI  - Landscape Ecology of Sylvatic Chikungunya Virus and Mosquito Vectors in Southeastern Senegal
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - The risk of human infection with sylvatic chikungunya (CHIKV) virus was assessed in a focus of sylvatic arbovirus circulation in Senegal by investigating distribution and abundance of anthropophilic Aedes mosquitoes, as well as the abundance and distribution of CHIKV in these mosquitoes. A 1650 km(2) area was classified into five land cover classes: forest, barren, savanna, agriculture and village. A total of 39,799 mosquitoes was sampled from all classes using human landing collections between June 2009 and January 2010. Mosquito diversity was extremely high, and overall vector abundance peaked at the start of the rainy season. CHIKV was detected in 42 mosquito pools. Our data suggest that Aedes furcifer, which occurred abundantly in all land cover classes and landed frequently on humans in villages outside of houses, is probably the major bridge vector responsible for the spillover of sylvatic CHIKV to humans.

TI  - Data Mining-Aided Automatic Landslide Detection Using Airborne Laser Scanning Data in Densely Forested Tropical Areas
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Landslide is a natural hazard that threats lives and properties in many areas around the world. Landslides are difficult to recognize, particularly in rainforest regions. Thus, an accurate, detailed, and updated inventory map is required for landslide susceptibility, hazard, and risk analyses. The inconsistency in the results obtained using different features selection techniques in the literature has highlighted the importance of evaluating these techniques. Thus, in this study, six techniques of features selection were evaluated. Very-high-resolution LiDAR point clouds and orthophotos were acquired simultaneously in a rainforest area of Cameron Highlands, Malaysia by airborne laser scanning (LiDAR). A fuzzy-based segmentation parameter (FbSP optimizer) was used to optimize the segmentation parameters. Training samples were evaluated using a stratified random sampling method and set to 70% training samples. Two machine-learning algorithms, namely, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF), were used to evaluate the performance of each features selection algorithm. The overall accuracies of the SVM and RF models revealed that three of the six algorithms exhibited higher ranks in landslide detection. Results indicated that the classification accuracies of the RF classifier were higher than the SVM classifier using either all features or only the optimal features. The proposed techniques performed well in detecting the landslides in a rainforest area of Malaysia, and these techniques can be easily extended to similar regions.

TI  - Plant Species Discrimination in a Tropical Wetland Using <i>In Situ</i> Hyperspectral Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - We investigated the use of full-range (400-2,500 nm) hyperspectral data obtained by sampling foliar reflectances to discriminate 46 plant species in a tropical wetland in Jamaica. A total of 47 spectral variables, including derivative spectra, spectral vegetation indices, spectral position variables, normalized spectra and spectral absorption features, were used for classifying the 46 species. The Mann-Whitney U-test, paired one-way ANOVA, principal component analysis (PCA), random forest (RF) and a wrapper approach with a support vector machine were used as feature selection methods. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA), an artificial neural network (ANN) and a generalized linear model fitted with elastic net penalties (GLMnet) were then used for species separation. For comparison, the RF classifier (denoted as RFa) was also used to separate the species by using all reflectance spectra and spectral indices, respectively, without applying any feature selection. The RFa classifier was able to achieve 91.8% and 84.8% accuracy with importance-ranked spectral indices and reflectance spectra, respectively. The GLMnet classifier produced the lowest overall accuracies for feature-selected reflectance spectra data (52-77%) when compared with the LDA and ANN methods. However, when feature-selected spectral indices were used, the GLMnet produced overall accuracies ranging from 79 to 88%, which were the highest among the three classifiers that used feature-selected data. A total of 12 species recorded a 100% producer accuracy, but with spectral indices, and an additional 8 species had perfect producer accuracies, regardless of the input features. The results of this study suggest that the GLMnet classifier can be used, particularly on feature-selected spectral indices, to discern vegetation in wetlands. However, it might be more efficient to use RFa without feature-selected variables, especially for spectral indices.

TI  - After the epizootic: Host-pathogen dynamics in montane tropical amphibian communities with high prevalence of chytridiomycosis
T2  - BIOTROPICA
AB  - The amphibian fungal disease chytridiomycosis, caused byBatrachochytrium dendrobatidis(Bd), poses a great threat to global amphibian biodiversity. In Peruvian cloud forests of the Kosnipata Valley of Manu National Park where chytrid infection is highly prevalent, we have monitored species-rich amphibian communities since 1996. An epizootic of chytridiomycosis is thought to have caused the disappearance of 35% of species richness in the early 2000s. We investigated the post-epizooticBdprevalence and infection intensity within the remnant amphibian community from 2008 to 2015, and modeledBddynamics as a function of species, season, reproductive mode, life stage, and elevation. Prevalence was higher in 2012-2015 than in 2008-2009, but overall prevalence has remained fairly constant (similar to 50%) post-epizootic. We also found that while prevalence decreased with elevation during the wet season, it generally increased with elevation during the dry season, potentially due to seasonal changes in temperature and precipitation. In aquatic habitats,Bdis likely maintained through a single, stream-breeding, putative reservoir species (which survived epizootics, in contrast to other aquatic-breeding species). The now-dominant terrestrial-breeding species allowBdto persist and spread in terrestrial habitats, possibly through individual dispersal into naive areas. We conclude thatBdprevalence in the Kosnipata Valley has stabilized over time, suggesting thatBdis now enzootic. Long-term monitoring of host infection is important because temporal changes in prevalence and infection intensity can cause changes in host species richness and abundance, which in turn may alter the trajectory of host-pathogen dynamics. in Spanish is available with online material.

TI  - Community Attitudes toward Mass Drug Administration for Control and Elimination of Neglected Tropical Diseases after the 2014 Outbreak of Ebola Virus Disease in Lofa County, Liberia
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - The recent outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) interrupted mass drug administration (MDA) programs to control and eliminate neglected tropical diseases in Liberia. MDA programs treat entire communities with medication regardless of infection status to interrupt transmission and eliminate lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis. Following reports of hostilities toward health workers and fear that they might be spreading EVD, it was important to determine whether attitudes toward MDA might have changed after the outbreak. We surveyed 140 community leaders from 32 villages in Lofa County, Liberia, that had previously participated in MDA and are located in an area that was an early epicenter of the EVD outbreak. Survey respondents reported a high degree of community trust in the MDA program, and 97% thought their communities were ready to resume MDA. However, respondents predicted that fewer people would comply with MDA after the EVD epidemic than before. The survey also uncovered fears in the community that EVD and MDA might be linked. Respondents suggested that MDA programs emphasize to people that the medications are identical to those previously distributed and that MDA programs have nothing to do with EVD.

TI  - The contribution of competition to tree mortality in old-growth coniferous forests
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Competition is a well-documented contributor to tree mortality in temperate forests, with numerous studies documenting a relationship between tree death and the competitive environment. Models frequently rely on competition as the only non-random mechanism affecting tree mortality. However, for mature forests, competition may cease to be the primary driver of mortality.
   We use a large, long-term dataset to study the importance of competition in determining tree mortality in old-growth forests on the western slope of the Sierra Nevada of California, U.S.A. We make use of the comparative spatial configuration of dead and live trees, changes in tree spatial pattern through time, and field assessments of contributors to an individual tree's death to quantify competitive effects.
   Competition was apparently a significant contributor to tree mortality in these forests. Trees that died tended to be in more competitive environments than trees that survived, and suppression frequently appeared as a factor contributing to mortality. On the other hand, based on spatial pattern analyses, only three of 14 plots demonstrated compelling evidence that competition was dominating mortality. Most of the rest of the plots fell within the expectation for random mortality, and three fit neither the random nor the competition model. These results suggest that while competition is often playing a significant role in tree mortality processes in these forests it only infrequently governs those processes. In addition, the field assessments indicated a substantial presence of biotic mortality agents in trees that died.
   While competition is almost certainly important, demographics in these forests cannot accurately be characterized without a better grasp of other mortality processes. In particular, we likely need a better understanding of biotic agents and their interactions with one another and with competition. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - First description of sarcoptic mange in a wild coati (<i>Nasua narica</i>), in Ecuador, and cooccurrence of canine distemper virus
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE PARASITOLOGIA VETERINARIA
AB  - We present a case of Sarcoptes and canine distemper virus (CDV) infection in a white-nosed coati (Nasua narica) that was trapped in the dry tropical forest of Cerro Blanco reserve, located in the coastal region of Ecuador. Sarcoptic mange is a highly contagious and zoonotic disease with worldwide distribution that causes epidemics. Mange is produced by Sarcoptes mites that causes severe epidermal damage. Secondary infections and physiological constrictions without treatment can lead to death of the host. In addition, cooccurrence of canine distemper virus was detected via iiRT-PCR from serum samples. Physical analyses showed that 90% of the skin was affected by severe alopecia due to the sarcoptic mange infection. The presence of mites and histopathological analyses confirmed the diagnosis of infection. This coati was taken to a veterinary clinic and was fed every day, but it died after four days. This is the first report of sarcoptic mange and the first report of CDV in white-nosed coatis in South America. Further studies are needed in this region, to seek out other suspected cases, given the high capacity for disease transmission. Preventive actions to avoid epidemic and zoonotic episodes are needed.

TI  - Incidence of avian malaria in hummingbirds in humid premontane forests of Pichincha Province, Ecuador: A pilot study
T2  - VETERINARY WORLD
AB  - Background and Aim: Avian malaria is a tropical disease caused by protozoans of the genera Plasmodium and Haemoproteus. As a nonlethal disease, avian malaria can affect the lifespan and reproductive rate of birds. If there is a differential effect depending on bird species, then this disease might have a significant effect on avian biodiversity. The current study aimed to determine the incidence of Plasmodium in hummingbirds in humid premontane forest areas.
   Materials and Methods: Blood samples (n=60) were collected from hummingbirds from two areas (Santuario de Aves Milpe and Hacienda Puyucunapi) of Pichincha Province, Ecuador. Prevalence and parasitemia were determined by microscopic examination of blood smears stained with Giemsa reagent. Both study sites are part of a 1000 m elevational gradient; hence, elevation was used as a predictor variable for prevalence and parasitemia levels in a Mann-Whitney U-test. This test was also used to test for a sex bias.
   Results: This study reports on a total of 12 bird species that inhabit both study sites. At Milpe, the lower elevation site, a prevalence of 100% was recorded, whereas at Puyucunapi, the prevalence was 96%. The combined prevalence was 97%. Elevation and sex did not influence prevalence nor parasitemia in hummingbirds.
   Conclusion: This study does not suggest a significant elevation or sex bias on prevalence and parasitemia in hummingbirds.

TI  - Phylogenetic relationships and evolutionary patterns of the genus <i>Psammolestes</i> Bergroth, 1911 (Hemiptera: Reduviidae: Triatominae)
T2  - BMC ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB  - Background The evolutionary history of biodiversity in South America has been poorly studied in the seasonal dry tropical forest (SDTF). Species diversification in this ecosystem may have a twofold explanation. First, intermittent connections in the middle and late Pleistocene promoted species dispersal and/or genetic connectivity between lineages isolated in disjunct patches of forest. Second, allopatric speciation proceeded immediately after the formation and colonization of the SDTF in the Neogene. Here we studied the diversification of Psammolestes, a genus endemic of the SDTF and naturally infected with Trypanosoma cruzi (agent of Chagas disease), using a combination of phylogenetic, population genetics and niche model methods, and evaluated the reliability of the three morphospecies currently recognized. Results Our multilocus analyses recovered P. coreodes and P. tertius in a monophyletic clade sister to P. arthuri. Species delimitation tests recovered these lineages as different species despite the shared genetic variation observed between P. coreodes and P. tertius in five genes. Also, genetic variation of the genus clustered in three groups that were consistent with the three morphospecies. Our demographic model predicted a scenario of divergence in absence of gene flow, suggesting that mixed haplotypes may be the result of shared ancestral variation since the divergence of the subtropical-temperate species P. coreodes and P. tertius. In contrast, the tropical species P. arthuri was highly differentiated from the other two in all tests of genetic structure, and consistently, the Monmonier's algorithm identified a clear geographical barrier that separates this species from P. coreodes and P. tertius. Conclusions We found three genetically structured lineages within Psammolestes that diverged in absence of gene flow in the late Miocene. This result supports a scenario of species formation driven by geographical isolation rather than by divergence in the face of gene flow associated with climatic oscillations in the Pleistocene. Also, we identified the Amazon basin as a climatic barrier that separates tropical from subtropical-temperate species, thus promoting allopatric speciation after long range dispersion. Finally, each species of Psammolestes occupies different climatic niches suggesting that niche conservatism is not crucial for species differentiation. These findings influence the current vector surveillance programs of Chagas disease in the region.

Models such as k-nearest neighbour (kNN), support vector machines (SVM), artificial neural networks (ANN), and random forests (RF) have been used effectively to classify LULC types at a range of geographical scales. However, ML models have not been widely applied in African tropical regions due to methodological challenges that arise from relying on the coarse-resolution satellite images available for these areas. In this study, we compared the performance of four ML algorithms (kNN, SVM, ANN and RF) applied to LULC monitoring within the Mayo Rey department, North Province, Cameroon. We used satellite data from the Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) combined with 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images of northern Cameroon for November 2000 and November 2020. Our results showed that all four classification algorithms produced relatively high accuracy (overall classification accuracy >80%), with the RF model (> 90% classification accuracy) outperforming the kNN, SVM, and ANN models. We found that approximately 7% of all forested areas (dense forest and woody savanna) were converted to other land cover types between 2000 and 2020; this forest loss is particularly associated with an expansion of both croplands and built-up areas. Our study represents a novel application and comparison of statistical and ML approaches to LULC monitoring using coarse-resolution satellite images in an African tropical forest and savanna setting. The resulting land cover maps serve as an important baseline that will be useful to the Cameroon government for policy development, conservation planning, urban planning, and deforestation and agricultural monitoring.

TI  - Seedling fate across different habitats: The effects of herbivory and soil fertility
T2  - BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - The impact of extinction of predators and subsequent herbivore release on ecosystem functioning has been well studied in temperate ecosystems, yet we have very little information on threatened tropical rainforests. Herbivore overbrowsing can have profound effects on ecosystem processes through overconsumption or by altering organic inputs of leaves and roots as well as changing soil physical and chemical properties. We evaluated the fate of transplanted seedlings of four tropical tree species and nutrient availability in open control plots and enclosed plots that permitted free access by insects and excluded vertebrates and collected soil samples in old-fields, early secondary forests and old-growth forests. Seedling damage predominantly occurred in the dry season and produced an overall seedling mortality of 72%, with values of 43% and 86% in the plots that prohibited and permitted vertebrate access, respectively. Except for Myrsine coriacea in the old-fields and Syagrus romanzoffiana in the early secondary forest, seedlings suffered greater rates of damage and mortality in the open plots, showing that the aboveground large herbivores, such as capybaras (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris), might prevent or at least delay plant recruitment in tropical areas supporting elevated densities. However, delayed deaths from disease by soil fertility-related factors were observed in late summer in the old-field seedlings, suggesting that previous activities in these areas had led to profound changes in the soil properties. Herbivores may have important consequences for tropical forest regeneration, as overconsumption may slow down nutrient cycling, promote cascading bottom-up effects on consumers, and ultimately lead to ecological meltdown. These consequences provide insight into the ecological effects of faunal change on human-altered tropical habitats.

TI  - Human monkeypox
T2  - PATHOLOGIE BIOLOGIE
AB  - Unlike other recent viral emergences, which were in majority caused by RNA viruses, the monkeypox results from infection by a DNA virus, an orthopoxvirus closely related to both vaccine and smallpox viruses and whose two genomic variants are known. Unexpectedly isolated from captive Asiatic monkeys and first considered as an laboratory curiosity, this virus was recognised in 1970 as an human pathogen in tropical Africa. Here it was responsible for sporadie cases following intrusions (for hunting) into tropical rain forests or rare outbreak with human-to-human transmission as observed in 1996 in Democratic Republic of Congo. As monkeypox in humans not distinguishable from smallpox (a disease globally eradicated in 1977) it was only subjected to vigilant epidemiological surveillance and not considered as a potential threat outside Africa. This point of view radically changed in 2003 when monkeypox was introduced in USA by African wild rodents and spread to 11 different states of this country. Responsible for 82 infections in American children and adults, this outbreak led to realize the sanitary hazards resulting from international trade of exotic animals and scientific investigations increasing extensively our knowledge of this zoonosis.

TI  - Deep Learning Based Retrieval of Forest Aboveground Biomass from Combined LiDAR and Landsat 8 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Estimation of forest aboveground biomass (AGB) is crucial for various technical and scientific applications, ranging from regional carbon and bioenergy policies to sustainable forest management. However, passive optical remote sensing, which is the most widely used remote sensing data for retrieving vegetation parameters, is constrained by spectral saturation problems and cloud cover. On the other hand, LiDAR data, which have been extensively used to estimate forest structure attributes, cannot provide sufficient spectral information of vegetation canopies. Thus, this study aimed to develop a novel synergistic approach to estimating biomass by integrating LiDAR data with Landsat 8 imagery through a deep learning-based workflow. First the relationships between biomass and spectral vegetation indices (SVIs) and LiDAR metrics were separately investigated. Next, two groups of combined optical and LiDAR indices (i.e., COLI1 and COLI2) were designed and explored to identify their performances in biomass estimation. Finally, five prediction models, including K-nearest Neighbor, Random Forest, Support Vector Regression, the deep learning model, i.e., Stacked Sparse Autoencoder network (SSAE), and multiple stepwise linear regressions, were individually used to estimate biomass with input variables of different scenarios, i.e., (i) all the COLI1 (ACOLI1), (ii) all the COLI2 (ACOLI2), (iii) ACOLI1 and all the optical (AO) and LiDAR variables (AL), and (iv) ACOLI2, AO and AL. Results showed that univariate models with the combined optical and LiDAR indices as explanatory variables presented better modeling performance than those with either optical or LiDAR data alone, regardless of the combination mode. The SSAE model obtained the best performance compared to the other tested prediction algorithms for the forest biomass estimation. The best predictive accuracy was achieved by the SSAE model with inputs of combined optical and LiDAR variables (i.e., ACOLI1, AO and AL) that yielded an R-2 of 0.935, root mean squared error (RMSE) of 15.67 Mg/ha, and relative root mean squared error (RMSEr) of 11.407%. It was concluded that the presented combined indices were simple and effective by integrating LiDAR-derived structure information with Landsat 8 spectral data for estimating forest biomass. Overall, the SSAE model with inputs of Landsat 8 and LiDAR integrated information resulted in accurate estimation of forest biomass. The presented modeling workflow will greatly facilitate future forest biomass estimation and carbon stock assessments.

TI  - Infection and co-infection by the amphibian chytrid fungus and ranavirus in wild Costa Rican frogs
T2  - DISEASES OF AQUATIC ORGANISMS
AB  - Amphibian populations are globally threatened by emerging infectious diseases, and 2 pathogens in particular are recognized as major threats: the amphibian chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) and ranaviruses. Here, we evaluated the prevalence of infection by Bd and ranavirus in an assemblage of frogs from a lowland wet forest in Costa Rica. We found an overall prevalence of 21.3% for Bd and 16.6% for ranavirus, and detected both pathogens widely among our 20 sampled species. We found a positive association between ranavirus and Bd infection in one of our 4 most commonly sampled species. We also found a positive but non-significant association be tween infection by ranavirus and infection by Bd among species overall. Our study is among the first detailed evaluations of ranavirus prevalence in the American tropics, and to our knowledge is the first to detect a positive association between Bd and ranavirus in any species. Considerable research attention has focused on the ecology of Bd in tropical regions, yet we argue that greater research focus is necessary to understand the ecology and conservation impact of ranaviruses on amphibian populations already decimated by the emergence of Bd.

TI  - Levers for the agroecological transition of tropical agriculture
T2  - AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB  - To promote greater sustainability in agriculture, development of agroecology is increasingly being invoked. What are the conditions for establishing agroecological production in tropical regions? Based upon case studies in several tropical areas, we provide here some answers to this question. We review the "pillars" (i.e. principles) and the "implementation levers" (i.e., tools) for the development of agroecology. We identify three main pillars: (1) the mobilization and management of ecological processes for the sustainable production and the resilience of agroecosystems; (2) the development of interactions between technical, social, environmental, and institutional components of agroecosystems for a holistic approach to agroecology; and (3) the scaling up of agroecology that takes place with a plurality of actions and pathways at different organization levels rather than an increase in resources and a replication of standardized technical processes. To implement these three pillars, we identify 11 main bio-technical, cognitive, socio-political, and organizational levers. Bio-technical levers include those for (1) mobilizing complementarity between crop species to optimize natural resources use, (2) mobilizing functional biodiversity at the plot scale to optimize natural regulation of pests and diseases, (3) managing biodiversity at landscape and territorial scales, (4) increasing the efficiency of biogeochemical cycles, and (5) renewing targets for genetic improvement. Cognitive, socio-political, and organizational levers include those for (6) political and institutional action at the national and global level, (7) action at the local level to support producers, (8) political and organizational action at the territorial level, (9) the marketing and the development of new agri-chains, (10) the development of new methods for evaluating production systems, and (11) the recognition of the values of gender and generation within families and other organisational levels. This paper provides an overall orientation for the agroecological transition in tropical agriculture and also considers the socio-political context that underlies this transition.

TI  - Development and polymorphism of simple sequence repeat DNA markers for <i>Shorea curtisii</i> and other Dipterocarpaceae species
T2  - HEREDITY
AB  - Nine simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were developed from Shorea curtisii using two different methods. One SSR locus was isolated by the commonly used method of screening by colony hybridization, and the other eight loci were isolated by a vectorette PCR method. Primer pairs were designed based on the sequences of all these SSR loci. Analysis of 40 individuals of S. curtisii from natural forest in Malaysia revealed that all SSR loci were polymorphic. Four SSR markers, Shc01, Shc04, Shc07 and Shc09, were highly polymorphic. We have also tested the applicability of these SSR printers to other species of Dipterocarpaceae using PCR amplification. Because the flanking region sequences of the S. curtisii SSRs were well conserved within this family, the SSR primers for S. curtisii can be applied to almost all species of Dipterocarpaceae.

TI  - Clinical management of canine leishmaniosis versus human leishmaniasis due to <i>Leishmania infantum</i>: Putting "One Health" principles into practice
T2  - VETERINARY PARASITOLOGY
AB  - The initiative One World, "One Health" tries to rapidly detect emerging or reemerging human and animal infectious diseases and prevent epidemiological situations such as deforestation, some agricultural practices or the appearance of new foci of leishmaniosis due to Leishmania infantum with alternative reservoirs.
   With this objective in mind, we here consider leishmaniosis in the Mediterranean basin and compare its current clinical management from two perspectives: that of a veterinarian specialized in infectious and parasitic diseases, and that of a physician specialized in infectious tropical diseases. We thus prepared a list of 10 key questions from epidemiology to control of the disease in both species: dogs and humans. This issue requires a concise and clear response to help animal and human health clinicians to improve their clinical management and understanding of this important zoonosis. Our ultimate aim is to update and bring together the information available backed by sound scientific evidence.

TI  - Importance of Genetic Engineering and Gene Therapy in the Management of Viral Diseases and Outbreaks
T2  - JOURNAL OF EVOLUTION OF MEDICAL AND DENTAL SCIENCES-JEMDS
AB  - Emerging globalisation over the years has brought a lot of opportunities in every corner of the world. The economy is now evolving, and things are getting easier for the public. But with all these affirmations, the spread of diseases all around the world has become easier and harder to contain. Epidemics usually result in pandemics due to the constant movement of the people from one part of the world to other. With the recent rapid onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the world has come to realise the inadvertent and unequal nature of the severity, and spread in the region of the disease. Hence, it is fair to say that such outbreaks carry the potential to cause a catastrophe on the global economy and livelihood. A changing environment and landscape, as we know, can cater to the fitness and development of new and accomplished viral diseases, and in today's era, with factors such as increasing population, tropical deforestation and rapid industrialisation, the viruses tend to adapt and exploit the replication of their genomes. Hence, leading to severe conditions in the human body. Some of the notable viral outbreaks include severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), HIV-AIDS, Ebola and the ongoing COVID-19. Genetic therapy is an extensively specific and elaborate stream which deals with manipulation of the human genes and is being considered as a form of a promising alternate medicine. The management of infectious diseases demands the introduction of specifically designed genes to either inhibit or block the gene expression to manoeuvre the functioning of the infectious agents. The following review discusses some of the most recent and notable outbreaks, their symptoms and the how advancements in genetic therapy came into play in treating, nullifying and managing them along with the rationale of the prospects and problems faced by the scientists over the years in developing vaccinations, treatment modalities and new controlled procedures in regulations of such outbreaks all over the world.

TI  - Serologic Evidence of Zoonotic Alphaviruses in Humans from an Indigenous Community in the Peruvian Amazon
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Alphaviruses (Togaviridae, Alphavirus) are arthropod-borne single-stranded RNA pathogens that cause febrile and neurologic disease in much of Latin America. However, many features of Alphavirus epidemiology remain unknown. In 2011, we undertook a cross-sectional study in Nueva Esperanza, an indigenous community in the Peruvian Amazon. Here, we present the first serologic evidence of Mayaro (MAYV), Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) complex alphavirus, Una (UNAV), and Madariaga (MADV) viruses reported in humans (24%, 16%, 13%, and 1.5%, respectively) from an Amazonian indigenous community in Peru. Hunting activity and cohabiting with hunters were the main risk factors for Mayaro seroconversion, but only hunting was associated with UNAV seropositivity. Our results suggest that alphavirus infection in this region is common, but we highlight the high UNAV seroprevalence found and corroborate the low MADV prevalence reported in this region. Furthermore, MAYV-neutralizing antibodies were also detected in stored samples from wild animals (18%) hunted by Nueva Esperanza inhabitants and another mestizo community located close to Iquitos. Further serological surveys of VEE complex alphaviruses, UNAV, and MADV in wild animals and assessing the ability of the MAYV seropositive species to transmit the virus will be relevant.

TI  - "Spider Monkey Cotton": Bridging Waiwai and Scientific Ontologies to Characterize Spider Monkey (<i>Ateles paniscus</i>) Filariasis in the Konashen Community Owned Conservation Area, Guyana
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY
AB  - Zoonotic disease risk is greatly influenced by cultural practices and belief systems. Yet, few studies have investigated how different ways of knowing are commensurate with one another in the context of zoonotic disease. By stressing methodological pluralism and explicitly challenging the nature-culture dichotomy, an ethnoprimatological approach is particularly well suited to bridging different ontologies for understanding zoonotic transmission. We seek to integrate molecular phylogenetics, histopathology, and ethnography to characterize a filarial nematode found within the abdominal cavity of spider monkeys (Ateles paniscus). The filarid is recognized as "spider monkey cotton" by Indigenous Waiwai in the Konashen Community Owned Conservation Area, Guyana. Ethnographic data revealed that the Waiwai perceive of "spider monkey cotton" as a normal characteristic within the "spider monkey person." Furthermore, the Waiwai indicated that "cotton" was ubiquitous with spider monkeys and is not understood to be infectious nor zoonotic. This distinction is in contrast to other internal parasites found within spider monkeys that the Waiwai believe cause disease in both monkeys and humans. Our morphological and molecular characterization support the classification of the filarid as Dipetalonema caudispina, a minimally studied, nonzoonotic parasite. While this identification contrasts with Waiwai understanding of the filarid as a component of the spider monkey itself, the ubiquity of the filarid in spider monkeys in the region and its nonzoonotic nature suggest scientific knowledge and Waiwai ontology are commensurate. More broadly, this work highlights the importance of integrating multiple knowledge systems and leveraging advanced genomics to better understand and prevent emerging zoonotic diseases.

TI  - Asparagus in tropical Australia - the first fifteen years
T2  - AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH
AB  - Location, climate, soil, crop establishment, cultural practice, and harvest information are given from 13 commercial plantings and 11 replicated trials of asparagus grown in tropical Australia since 1985. Both commercial plantings and trials have had a short life and low yields compared with plantings in subtropical and temperate parts of Australia. The unsuccessful outcomes to date are primarily because of the lack of experience in growing a perennial temperate vegetable crop in a tropical climate with high humidity during the wet season. After carefully considering poor results to date (attributed particularly to unsuitable soil type, insufficient disease control in the wet season, and inadequate carbohydrate reserves at harvest time) and reviewing current practices in relevant places elsewhere (especially the use of drought-induced dormancy), the chances of boosting average yields and having a prosperous industry in tropical Australia are considered good.

TI  - Integrating airborne laser scanning data, space-borne radar data and digital aerial imagery to estimate aboveground carbon stock in Hyrcanian forests, Iran
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
AB  - A framework for estimating aboveground forest carbon stock (AFCS) is required for measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV) systems under the United Nations Collaborative Program on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) in Developing Countries. Recently, methods for estimating the spatial distribution of AFCS using remotely sensed datasets and multiple prediction techniques have been found to be useful, particularly given the prohibitive costs of acquiring the necessary sample sizes for sufficiently precise pure field-based estimation of this variable. The objective of the study was to assess and compare the capabilities of airborne laser scanning (ALS) data, L-band radar data and UltraCam images in combination with four commonly used prediction techniques for estimating mean AFCS per unit area: multiple linear regression (MLR) and the nonparametric k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), support vector regression (SVR), and random forest (RF) algorithms. Our study area was a part of Hyrcanian deciduous forests in two managed and unmanaged stands at Shast Kalateh forest. We used a systematic sample consisting of 308 circular field plots of 0.1 ha located at the intersections of a 150 x 200 m grid with a random starting point and remote sensing-derived metrics as auxiliary data. We used 67% of the sample plots for training purposes and the remaining 33% for validation. Also, we used the model-assisted estimators to statistically rigorously estimate mean AFCS per unit area and its standard error (SE).
   Among the remotely sensed datasets, considered singly, the ALS data with R-2* = 0.34, rRMSE = 47.42% and relative efficiency (RE) = 1.51 produced the greatest accuracy and precision for AFCS estimation. RE can be interpreted as the factor by which the sample size for the pure field-based estimator would have to be increased to obtain the same precision as for the model-assisted estimator using auxiliary data. Among the remotely sensed datasets considered in combination, the ALS and PALSAR dataset with R-2* = 0.41, rRMSE = 44.80% and RE = 1.70 produced the greatest prediction accuracy and precision and increased the proportion of variability explained relative to ALS and PALSAR separately by 7% and 36%, respectively. Contrary to our expectation, the combination of PALSAR and UltraCam data decreased the precision of AFCS estimates. All the remotely sensed datasets, singly and in combination, with the most accurate prediction techniques for each combination produced estimates of AFCS that were within the 95% confidence interval for the field-based estimate.

TI  - The global procurement landscape of leishmaniasis medicines
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Ensuring access to essential medicines for leishmaniasis control is challenging, as leishmaniasis is a very small and unattractive market for pharmaceutical industry. Furthermore, control programmes are severely underfunded. We conducted an analysis of global procurement of leishmaniasis medicines for the past 5 years in order to shed light on the current leishmaniasis market landscape and supply and demand dynamics. We estimated global demand of each leishmaniasis medicines, the amount of each medicine required to treat all reported cases, based on the number of cases reported to WHO and the first-line treatment regimen used in each country. Procurement data were obtained from procurement agencies, international organizations, WHO, national leishmaniasis programmes and manufacturers. Expert interviews were conducted to have a better understanding of how medicines were procured and used. The comparison of estimated need and procurement data indicated discrepancies in supply and demand at global level as well as in the most endemic countries. The extent of the gap in supply was up to 80% of the needs for one of the leishmaniasis medicines. Mismatch between supply and demand was much wider for cutaneous leishmaniasis than visceral leishmaniasis. This study presents a current picture of procurement patterns and imbalance in global supply and demand. Addressing improved access and supply barriers requires concerted and coordinated efforts at the global and national levels. Priority actions include setting up a procurement coordination mechanism among major procurers, partners and national programmes where forecasting and supply planning is jointly developed and communicated with manufacturers. In addition, continuous engagement of manufacturers and advocacy is critical to diversify the supplier base and ensure quality-assured and affordable generic medicines for leishmaniasis.
   Author summary
   Even though more than 1 billion people are at the risk of leishmaniasis infection, one of the neglected tropical diseases, there is limited access to essential medicines for the treatment of leishmaniasis. We compared the procurement data collected from major procurers with the global needs estimated from the number of cases reported to WHO and the first-line treatment regimen used in each country for the past 5 years to better understand the market landscape and supply and demand dynamics. The results showed imbalances and mismatches in supply and demand at global and national levels. Improved coordination among national leishmaniasis control programmes, procurers, manufacturers and partners is needed to address access barriers. This should include proactive engagement of manufacturers to secure uninterrupted supply of quality-assured medicines, setting up the procurement coordination mechanism with major procurers for the development of joint forecasting and market shaping interventions, and promoting high-level advocacy.

A customized gene expression microarray of 18,760 transcripts known to target Aedes mosquito genome was used to identify host genes that are differentially regulated during the infectious entry process of CHIKV infection on C6/36 mosquito cells. Several genes such as epsin I (EPN1), epidermal growth factor receptor pathway substrate 15 (EPS15) and Huntingtin interacting protein I (HIP1) were identified to be differentially expressed during CHIKV infection and known to be involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME). Transmission electron microscopy analyses further revealed the presence of CHIKV particles within invaginations of the plasma membrane, resembling clathrin-coated pits. Characterization of vesicles involved in the endocytic trafficking processes of CHIKV revealed the translocation of the virus particles to the early endosomes and subsequently to the late endosomes and lysosomes. Treatment with receptor-mediated endocytosis inhibitor, monodansylcadaverine and clathrin-associated drug inhibitors, chlorpromazine and dynasore inhibited CHIKV entry, whereas no inhibition was observed with caveolin-related drug inhibitors. Inhibition of CHIKV entry upon treatment with low-endosomal pH inhibitors indicated that low pH is essential for viral entry processes. CHIKV entry by clathrin-mediated endocytosis was validated via overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant of Eps15, in which infectious entry was reduced, while siRNA-based knockdown of genes associated with CME, low endosomal pH and RAB trafficking proteins exhibited significant levels of CHIKV inhibition. This study revealed, for the first time, that the infectious entry of CHIKV into mosquito cells is mediated by the clathrin-dependent endocytic pathway.

TI  - Classification of Tree Species in a Diverse African Agroforestry Landscape Using Imaging Spectroscopy and Laser Scanning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Airborne imaging spectroscopy (IS) and laser scanning (ALS) have been explored widely for tree species classification during the past decades. However, African agroforestry areas, where a few exotic tree species are dominant and many native species occur less frequently, have not yet been studied. Obtaining maps of tree species would provide useful information for the characterization of agroforestry systems and detecting invasive species. Our objective was to study tree species classification in a diverse tropical landscape using IS and ALS data at the tree crown level, with primary interest in the exotic tree species. We performed multiple analyses based on different IS and ALS feature sets, identified important features using feature selection, and evaluated the impact of combining the two data sources. Given that a high number of tree species with limited sample size (499 samples for 31 species) was expected to limit the classification accuracy, we tested different approaches to group the species based on the frequency of their occurrence and Jeffries-Matusita (JM) distance. Surface reflectance at wavelengths between 400-450 nm and 750-800 nm, and height to crown width ratio, were identified as important features. Nonetheless, a selection of minimum noise fraction (MNF) transformed reflectance bands showed superior performance. Support vector machine classifier performed slightly better than the random forest classifier, but the improvement was not statistically significant for the best performing feature set. The highest F1-scores were achieved when each of the species was classified separately against a mixed group of all other species, which makes this approach suitable for invasive species detection. Our results are valuable for organizations working on biodiversity conservation and improving agroforestry practices, as we showed how the non-native Eucalyptus spp., Acacia mearnsii and Grevillea robusta (mean F1-scores 76%, 79% and 89%, respectively) trees can be mapped with good accuracy. We also found a group of six fruit bearing trees using JM distance, which was classified with mean F1-score of 65%. This was a useful finding, as these species could not be classified with acceptable accuracy individually, while they all share common economic and ecological importance.

TI  - A Review of the Antimalarial, Antitrypanosomal, and Antileishmanial Activities of Natural Compounds Isolated From Nigerian Flora
T2  - FRONTIERS IN CHEMISTRY
AB  - The West African country Nigeria features highly diverse vegetation and climatic conditions that range from rain forest bordering the Atlantic Ocean in the South to the Desert (Sahara) at the Northern extreme. Based on data from the World Conservation Monitoring Center of the United Nations Environmental Protection, Nigeria, with similar to 5,000 documented vascular plants, ranks amongst the top 50 countries in terms of biodiversity. Such a rich biodiversity implies that the country is rich in diverse secondary metabolites-natural products/unique chemicals produced by the plant kingdom to confer selective advantages to them. Like many tropical countries, Nigeria is also endemic to numerous infectious diseases particularly those caused by parasitic pathogens. These phytochemicals have been exploited for the treatment of diseases and as a result, a new branch of chemistry, natural product chemistry, has evolved, to try to reproduce and improve the therapeutic qualities of particular phytochemicals. In this review, we have compiled a compendium of natural products, isolated from Nigerian flora, that have been reported to be effective against certain protozoan parasites with the aim that it will stimulate interests for further investigations, and give impetus to the development of the natural products into registered drugs. In total 93 structurally characterized natural compounds have been identified with various levels of anti-parasite activity mainly from Nigerian plants. The synthesis protocol and molecular target for some of these natural anti-parasite agents have been established. For instance, the anti-plasmodial compound fagaronine (7), a benzophenanthridine alkaloid from Fagara zanthoxyloides has been successfully synthesized in the laboratory, and the anti-trypanosomal compound azaanthraquinone (55) elicits its effect by inhibiting mitochondrial electron transfer in trypanosomes. This review also discusses the barriers to developing approved drugs from phytochemicals, and the steps that should be taken in order to accelerate the development of new antiparasitics from the highlighted compounds.

TI  - Malaria control in a forest fringe area of Assam, India: a pilot study
T2  - TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - A study was conducted to evaluate the preventive efficacy of insecticide-treated mosquito nets (ITMNs) and mosquito repellent (MR) in a malaria-endemic foothill area of Assam, India, with forest ecosystem. During the first year, a survey was conducted in four demarcated sectors (A-D) to observe the malaria endemicity and vector prevalence patterns before implementing intervention measures. All four sectors were endemic for malaria. The prevalence of established malaria vectors such as Anopheles dims, A. minimus and A. philippinensis was observed. During the second year, intervention measures were implemented in the four sectors as follows: A, ITMN + MR; B, ITMN; C, MR; D, no intervention. The most effective intervention was in sector A, followed by sectors B and C. Sectors A and B exhibited significantly higher (P < 0.001) malaria protective efficacy during both the first and second years of intervention compared with sector D. The total vector population in the three intervention sectors decreased significantly compared with that of the non-intervention one. Information-education-communication activities motivated the residents to participate actively in the intervention programme. The finding could be an effective model for containment of high malaria morbidity in inaccessible forest fringe areas of the northeastern region of India.

TI  - Characterisation of <i>Chrysoporthe cubensis</i> and <i>Chrysoporthe deuterocubensis</i>, the Stem Canker Diseases of <i>Eucalyptus</i> spp. in a Forest Plantation in Malaysia
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Commercial plantations of Eucalyptus species have been established in Malaysia, especially during the past 10 years, with the aim of sustaining the supply of wood and timber products for industrial use in Malaysia. As part of an assessment of fungal diseases affecting Eucalyptus species in four regions in Malaysia, including Kelantan, Pahang, Sabah, and Selangor, stem canker disease was discovered to be a widespread disease infecting Eucalyptus species in Malaysia. This study aimed to identify the fungus-causing stem canker disease, test its pathogenicity in Eucalyptus, and determine the mating type of isolates from the infected trees. The fungi were identified based on morphology and through comparisons of DNA sequence data from the ITS, beta-tubulin 2 gene, and TEF-1 alpha gene regions. Phylogenetic analyses showed that the causal agent of the stem canker was Chrysoporthe cubensis infecting Eucalyptus plantations in Pahang and Chrysoporthe deuterocubensis infecting Eucalyptus plantations in Kelantan, Sabah, and Selangor. We believe this is the first report of Chrysoporthe cubensis-infected Eucalyptus in Malaysia and Southeast Asia, while Chrysoporthe deuterocubensis is the first-reported species infecting Eucalyptus pellita in Malaysia. Moreover, the fact that the mating-type MAT1-1 and MAT1-2 genes and the pheromone genes ppg1, ppg2, pre1, and pre2 were identified in all isolates indicates that Chrysoporthe cubensis and Chrysoporthe deuterocubensis are homothallic mating systems. Pathogenicity was tested on a 3-year-old standing tree, 1-year-old seedling, and detached healthy leaves, which were re-isolated for fulfilling Koch's postulates. In pathogenicity trials, both Chrysoporthe cubensis and Chrysoporthe deuterocubensis gave rise to lesions on wounded Eucalyptus. Both Chrysoporthe spp. were equally pathogenic to Eucalyptus urograndis and Eucalyptus pellita and should be regarded as a biosecurity concern in Malaysia's forest plantation industry.

TI  - Carbon stocks in shaded <i>Theobroma cacao</i> farms and adjacent secondary forests of similar age in Cameroon
T2  - TROPICAL ECOLOGY
AB  - Cacao is an important smallholder crop in West Africa, often grown under a forest canopy. Yields from cacao farms are low so farmers consider removing shade trees, however, the impacts on pest and disease dynamics, soil fertility and thus yield in the longer term are not understood. We estimated carbon stocks in shaded cacao systems in Cameroon using equations that took account of wood densities of individual species. The average C stock in cacao trees was 14.4 Mg C ha(-1), compared with 121.1 Mg C ha(-1) in the upper shade tree canopy, 5.8 Mg C ha(-1) in necromass and 90 Mg ha(-1) in soil. While total stock was comparable to that in secondary forest, only a small proportion was in the cacao per-se. Cutting shade trees would significantly reduce carbon stocks. Impacts of reduced C stock on sustainability are discussed.

TI  - Emerging tropical diseases in Australia. Part 4. Mosquitoborne diseases
T2  - ANNALS OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND PARASITOLOGY
AB  - Mosquito-borne diseases continue to be a serious public-health concern in Australia. Endemic alphaviruses (including Ross River and Barmah Forest viruses) account for the majority of the arboviral notifications, while some flaviviruses (Murray Valley encephalitis, Japanese encephalitis and Kunjin viruses) cause occasional outbreaks of encephalitis. Dengue epidemics are increasing in frequency in northern Queensland, with the largest outbreak in 50 years occurring during the 2008-2009 wet season. Of great concern are the threats posed by the importation of exotic arboviruses, such as West Nile, chikungunya and Rift Valley fever viruses, the introduction of exotic vectors, and the potential range expansion of key Australian vectors. Environmental and anthropogenic influences provide additional uncertainty regarding the future impact of mosquito-borne pathogens in Australia. This review discusses the trends, threats and challenges that face the management of mosquito-borne disease in Australia. Topical mosquito-borne pathogens of biosecurity and public-health concern, and the potential impacts of environmental and global trends, are discussed. Finally, a short overview of the public-health response capability in Australia is provided.

TI  - Buruli ulcer disease prevalence in Benin, West Africa: associations with land use/cover and the identification of disease clusters
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH GEOGRAPHICS
AB  - Background: Buruli ulcer (BU) disease, caused by infection with the environmental mycobacterium M. ulcerans, is an emerging infectious disease in many tropical and sub-tropical countries. Although vectors and modes of transmission remain unknown, it is hypothesized that the transmission of BU disease is associated with human activities in or around aquatic environments, and that characteristics of the landscape (e.g., land use/ cover) play a role in mediating BU disease. Several studies performed at relatively small spatial scales (e.g., within a single village or region of a country) support these hypotheses; however, if BU disease is associated with land use/ cover characteristics, either through spatial constraints on vector-host dynamics or by mediating human activities, then large-scale (i.e., country- wide) associations should also emerge. The objectives of this study were to (1) investigate associations between BU disease prevalence in villages in Benin, West Africa and surrounding land use/ cover patterns and other map-based characteristics, and (2) identify areas with greater and lower than expected prevalence rates (i.e., disease clusters) to assist with the development of prevention and control programs.
   Results: Our landscape-based models identified low elevation, rural villages surrounded by forest land cover, and located in drainage basins with variable wetness patterns as being associated with higher BU disease prevalence rates. We also identified five spatial disease clusters. Three of the five clusters contained villages with greater than expected prevalence rates and two clusters contained villages with lower than expected prevalence rates. Those villages with greater than expected BU disease prevalence rates spanned a fairly narrow region of south-central Benin.
   Conclusion: Our analyses suggest that interactions between natural land cover and human alterations to the landscape likely play a role in the dynamics of BU disease. For example, urbanization, potentially by providing access to protected water sources, may reduce the likelihood of becoming infected with BU disease. Villages located at low elevations may have higher BU disease prevalence rates due to their close spatial proximity to high risk environments. In addition, forest land cover and drainage basins with variable wetness patterns may be important for providing suitable growth conditions for M. ulcerans, influencing the distribution and abundance of vectors, or mediating vector-human interactions. The identification of disease clusters in this study provides direction for future research aimed at better understanding these and other environmental and social determinants involved in BU disease outbreaks.

TI  - Ecology of chytridiomycosis in rainforest stream frog assemblages of tropical Queensland
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
AB  - In the wet tropics of Queensland, Australia, eight species of stream-dwelling frogs have experienced population declines. Some declines were associated with an emerging infectious disease of amphibians (chytridiomycosis) caused by the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. We examined the spatial and temporal pattern of infection prevalence in a sample of frog populations. Infected adults and tadpoles of all species were found, and infections occurred at every site. Infection prevalence varied among species and was always < 10.0% in adults but ranged from 0.75 to 76.0% in tadpoles. In this system tadpoles and adults of some species may act as disease reservoirs, experiencing avirulent infections, whereas other hosts (declining species) experience virulent infections. Infection prevalence was higher during the cool, dry winter season (May to September) and at high elevations (600-800 m), suggesting regulation by environmental conditions, including temperature and precipitation. We found no relationships between infection prevalence and mean body condition, fluctuating asymmetry of hind limbs, population density, or the presence of metamorphosing tadpoles and juvenile frogs. Although it is not certain whether chytridiomycosis was responsible for past frog population declines in the wet tropics of Queensland, the pathogen is now endemic. Our data indicate that at the landscape level, environmental conditions have strong effects on host-pathogen dynamics. These effects interact with species-specific behavior or immune function and may be important underlying determinants of chytridiomycosis epizootics and emergence.

T2  - BULLETIN DE L ACADEMIE NATIONALE DE MEDECINE
AB  - Six great ape species (chimpanzees, bonobos, Western gorillas, Eastern gorillas, Sumatran orangutans and Bornean orangutans) live in tropical forests of Africa and South-East Asia. Their habitat, severely threatened by deforestation, contains a vast chemical and biological diversity. During the last decade, we have isolated and identified novel pharmacologically active compounds from plants used by wild chimpanzees in Kibale National Park, Uganda. Our continuous observations over the last 12 years confirm that chimpanzees, when sick, may ingest plant material that are not generally eaten, supporting the existence of self-medication among great apes. Knowledge of great-ape diseases, and the medicinal resources of tropical forests, may be improved by preserving and studying our closest relatives in their natural habitat.

TI  - Breeding site selection and co-existing patterns of tropical mosquitoes
T2  - MEDICAL AND VETERINARY ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - We investigated the physicochemical properties and the biotic interactions of breeding sites of tropical mosquito species. Field sampling was done in 12 study areas in Sri Lanka covering areas with secondary natural forests and human settlements. A total of 226 breeding sites were investigated to determine the biotic interactions and physiochemical properties of breeding water (pH, Conductivity, Dissolved Oxygen, Total Dissolved Solids and Temperature). A total of 80.5% of breeding sites from both habitats were positive for mosquito larvae of seven genera and 24 species. Orthopodomyia flavithorax (297) and Aedes albopictus (295) were dominated in tree holes of Alstonia macrophylla, Vateria copallifera and Artocarpus nobilis. Diversity indices showed that the diversity of mosquitoes is high in wet zone habitats of Sri Lanka compared to dry and intermediate zone habitats. Aedes albopictus coexisted with 11 different mosquito species while it avoided larvae of Culex fuscanus, Cx. uniformis and Tripteroides affinis. Strong positive associations were reported between Ae. albopictus and Ar. subalbatus while larvae of Or. flavithorax mosquitoes were not co-occurred with the larvae of Ae. vittatus, Ae. aegypti, Cx. sitiens, Ar. subalbatus, Anopheles spp and Tr. affinis. The findings identified the breeding adaptability and tolerance to a wide range of physiochemical properties of tropical mosquito communities.

TI  - Big earth observation time series analysis for monitoring Brazilian agriculture
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
AB  - This paper presents innovative methods for using satellite image time series to produce land use and land cover classification over large areas in Brazil from 2001 to 2016. We used Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) time series data to classify natural and human-transformed land areas in the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil's agricultural frontier. Our hypothesis is that building high-dimensional spaces using all values of the time series, coupled with advanced statistical learning methods, is a robust and efficient approach for land cover classification of large data sets. We used the full depth of satellite image time series to create large dimensional spaces for statistical classification. The data consist of MODIS MOD13Q1 time series with 23 samples per year per pixel, and 4 bands (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), near-infrared (nir) and mid-infrared (mir)). By taking a series of labelled time series, we fed a 92 dimensional attribute space into a support vector machine model. Using a 5-fold cross validation, we obtained an overall accuracy of 94% for discriminating among nine land cover classes: forest, cerrado, pasture, soybean fallow, fallow-cotton, soybean-cotton, soybean-corn, soybean-millet, and soybean-sunflower. Producer and user accuracies for all classes were close to or better than 90%. The results highlight important trends in agricultural intensification in Mato Grosso. Double crop systems are now the most common production system in the state, sparing land from agricultural production. Pasture expansion and intensification has been less studied than crop expansion, although it has a stronger impact on deforestation and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Our results point to a significant increase in the stocking rate in Mato Grosso and to the possible abandonment of pasture areas opened in the state's frontier. The detailed land cover maps contribute to an assessment of the interplay between production and protection in the Brazilian Amazon and Cerrado biomes.

TI  - SOCIOECONOMIC FACTORS AND MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS APPLIED TO NEGLECTED DISEASES RISK PREDICTION. CASE STUDY IN THE MUNICIPALITIES OF THE GOI?S STATE AND FEDERAL DISTRICT, BRAZIL
T2  - FINISTERRA-REVISTA PORTUGUESA DE GEOGRAFIA
AB  - Analyzing the relation between socioeconomic variables and neglected tropical diseases can help managers in the conception of public policies to reduce cases. The obJective of this study was to evaluate, based on machine learning algorithms, which socioe-conomic variables are more important for the risk classification of three neglected diseases: leprosy, cutaneous leishmaniasis, and dengue. Three algorithms based on decision trees were evaluated: Random Forest (RF) , XGBoost , and C5.0. As a study area, the municipalities of the state of Goias and of the Federal District -Brazil, were delimited. For the dengue risk classes, both the RF algorithm and the XGBoost showed accuracy values above 0.6. Both emphasizing the low-income conditions, literacy, and race as the most important predictive variables. In the leprosy risk classes case, the three algorithms presented accuracy results above 0.6, indicating the variables water supply, literacy, race, and housing as important. For the cutaneous leishma-niasis risk classes, the algorithms showed an accuracy lower than 0.4, making the evaluation of possible predictive variables to the model unfeasible. The three evaluated algorithms revealed approximate predictive performance; however, the RF was slightly higher. The most important socioeconomic variables for dengue and leprosy risk classes prediction were similar.

TI  - Impacts of the creation, expansion and management of English wetlands on mosquito presence and abundance - developing strategies for future disease mitigation
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
AB  - The incidence of mosquito-borne diseases is increasing in Europe, partly due to the incursion of a number of invasive species known to be vectors of dengue and chikungunya viruses, but also due to the involvement of native species in the transmission of West Nile virus and malaria. For some of these pathogens, there is a risk of the re-emergence of vector-borne diseases that were once widespread in Europe, but declined partly due to large-scale land-drainage projects. Some mosquito species exploit container habitats as breeding sites in urban areas; an adaptation to human-made micro-habitats resulting from increased urbanisation. However, many species thrive in natural wetland ecosystems. Owing to the impacts of climate change there is an urgent need for environmental adaptation, such as the creation of new wetlands to mitigate coastal and inland flooding. In some cases, these initiatives can be coupled with environmental change strategies to protect a range of endangered flora and fauna species by enhancing and extending wetland landscapes, which may by driven by European legislation, particularly in urban areas. This paper reviews field studies conducted in England to assess the impact of newly created wetlands on mosquito colonisation in a) coastal, b) urban and c) arable reversion habitats. It also considers the impact of wetland management on mosquito populations and explores the implications of various water and vegetation management options on the range of British mosquito species. Understanding the impact of wetland creation and management strategies on mosquito prevalence and the potential risk of increasing the levels of nuisance or disease vector species will be crucial in informing health and well-being risk assessments, guiding targeted control, and anticipating the social effects of extreme weather and climate change. Although new wetlands will certainly extend aquatic habitats for mosquitoes, not all species will become a major nuisance or a vector concern as a result. Understanding how the design and management of wetlands might exacerbate mosquito densities is crucial if we are to manage nuisance mosquitoes and control vector species in the event of a disease outbreak. This entomological evidence-base will ensure that control strategies achieve optimal efficacy at minimal cost.

TI  - Temporal shifts in a <i>Xylaria</i> assemblage (Ascomycota, Xylariaceae) resulting from management activities in a protected cloud forest
T2  - ACTA BOTANICA MEXICANA
AB  - Background and Aims: Tropical montane cloud forest (TMCF) is one of the most threatened ecosystems worldwide. Natural protected areas (NPAs) have been established to prevent further loss of these forests in Mexico. To assess whether management activities temporally impact the biodiversity of NPAs, the use of indicator groups, such as some groups of macromycetes, has been proposed. The aim of this study was to assess the temporal shifts over the last 36 years in the alpha, beta, and gamma diversity of a Xylaria assemblage in a NPA of TMCF as a result of anthropogenic management activities.
   Methods: Collections were performed in a 31 ha NPA of TMCF in Xalapa, Veracruz, Mexico, during three 10 year and one six year sampling periods (1980-2016), taking into account specimens deposited in the herbarium XAL and collections performed by the authors, mainly in the two latter periods. Species number and abundance, compositional similarity, species turnover, and gamma diversity of assemblages were determined and compared among the sampling periods.
   Key results: Of 3480 individuals belonging to 30 Xylaria species, the most abundant species were X. scruposa, X. anisopleura, X. berteroi, X. cubensis, X. feejeensis, X. albocinctoides, and X. arbuscula. The inventory completeness was 99.9%. Species richness varied from six (1990-1999) to 28 species (2010-2016). Jaccard index separated two assemblage clusters. Gamma diversity was more influenced by beta diversity than alpha diversity.
   Conclusions: Xylaria assemblages are a useful bioindicator group and monitoring them over time may provide information about the impacts of management on TMCF ecosystems. Temporal dynamics of these assemblages partly depend on the historically implemented management in the NPA of TMCF. Effective conservation outcomes for TMCF will only be achieved if current management strategies are maintained and integrated into the long-term management framework of NPAs containing TMCF.

TI  - Between Securitisation and Neglect: Managing Ebola at the Borders of Global Health
T2  - MEDICAL HISTORY
AB  - In 2014 the World Health Organization (WHO) was widely criticised for failing to anticipate that an outbreak of Ebola in a remote forested region of south-eastern Guinea would trigger a public health emergency of international concern (pheic). In explaining the WHO's failure, critics have pointed to structural restraints on the United Nations organisation and a leadership vacuum' in Geneva, among other factors. This paper takes a different approach. Drawing on internal WHO documents and interviews with key actors in the epidemic response, I argue that the WHO's failure is better understood as a consequence of Ebola's shifting medical identity and of triage systems for managing emerging infectious disease (EID) risks. Focusing on the discursive and non-discursive practices that produced Ebola as a problem' for global health security, I argue that by 2014 Ebola was no longer regarded as a paradigmatic EID and potential biothreat so much as a neglected tropical disease. The result was to relegate Ebola to the fringes of biosecurity concerns just at the moment when the virus was crossing international borders in West Africa and triggering large urban outbreaks for the first time. Ebola's fluctuating medical identity also helps explain the prominence of fear and rumours during the epidemic and social resistance to Ebola control measures. Contrasting the WHO's delay over declaring a pheic in 2014, with its rapid declaration of pheics in relation to H1N1 swine flu in 2009 and polio in 2014, I conclude that such missed alarms' may be an inescapable consequence of pandemic preparedness systems that seek to rationalise responses to the emergence of new diseases.

TI  - Ecology of phlebotomines (Diptera, Psychodidae) in rural foci of leishmaniasis in tropical Brazil
T2  - REVISTA DA SOCIEDADE BRASILEIRA DE MEDICINA TROPICAL
AB  - Introduction: This work aimed to study the community structure of sandflies, with regard to the richness, constancy, abundance, and monthly frequency of the species with a focus on the transmission of leishmaniasis. Methods: The study was conducted in the rural villages of Bom Jardim and Santa Maria, situated on the edge of a tropical rain forest in the municipality of Sao Jose de Ribamar, Maranhao, Brazil. The phlebotomines were captured in the intradomiciles and peridomiciles of each village, with Centers for Disease Control (CDC) light traps set in 10 homes in each village, for 1 year, once a month, from 18h to 6h. Results: We collected 1,378 individuals of 16 sandfly species. The capture success rate was higher in Bom Jardim (0.61 specimens/hour/trap) than that of Santa Maria (0.35/specimens/hour/trap). The sandflies were more abundant in the peridomiciles (86.1%) and in the rainy season (77%). Five species were considered constants (occurring in more than 50% of samples), 5 accessory (25%-50%), and 6 accidental (<25%). The most abundant species were Lutzomyia longipalpis (59.7%) and L whitmani (28%). The permutation analysis showed differences between the species composition of the villages and no separation between the intradomicile and peridomicile of each village. The species that most contributed to the dissimilarity between the light traps of the 2 villages were L. longipalpis, L. whitmani, and L. evandroi, contributing to 80.8% of the variation among groups. Conclusions: The high level of richness and abundance of species and the presence of competent vectors throughout the year and around houses justify the occurrence of leishmaniasis cases reported in the area.

TI  - Integrating spaceborne LiDAR and Sentinel-2 images to estimate forest aboveground biomass in Northern China
T2  - CARBON BALANCE AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Background Fast and accurate forest aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation and mapping is the basic work of forest management and ecosystem dynamic investigation, which is of great significance to evaluate forest quality, resource assessment, and carbon cycle and management. The Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2), as one of the latest launched spaceborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors, can penetrate the forest canopy and has the potential to obtain accurate forest vertical structure parameters on a large scale. However, the along-track segments of canopy height provided by ICESat-2 cannot be used to obtain comprehensive AGB spatial distribution. To make up for the deficiency of spaceborne LiDAR, the Sentinel-2 images provided by google earth engine (GEE) were used as the medium to integrate with ICESat-2 for continuous AGB mapping in our study. Ensemble learning can summarize the advantages of estimation models and achieve better estimation results. A stacking algorithm consisting of four non-parametric base models which are the backpropagation (BP) neural network, k-nearest neighbor (kNN), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF) was proposed for AGB modeling and estimating in Saihanba forest farm, northern China. Results The results show that stacking achieved the best AGB estimation accuracy among the models, with an R-2 of 0.71 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 45.67 Mg/ha. The stacking resulted in the lowest estimation error with the decreases of RMSE by 22.6%, 27.7%, 23.4%, and 19.0% compared with those from the BP, kNN, SVM, and RF, respectively. Conclusion Compared with using Sentinel-2 alone, the estimation errors of all models have been significantly reduced after adding the LiDAR variables of ICESat-2 in AGB estimation. The research demonstrated that ICESat-2 has the potential to improve the accuracy of AGB estimation and provides a reference for dynamic forest resources management and monitoring.

TI  - Avian Mycobacteriosis in a Rescued Harpy Eagle from Darien Forest, Panama
T2  - ACTA SCIENTIAE VETERINARIAE
AB  - Background: The Harpy eagle (Harpia harpyia) is the largest raptor in the Neotropical region, distributed in low densities within primary forest habitats from southern Mexico to east-central Brazil, including Central America and Panama. Although locally extinct due to habitat degradation, human poaching and reduction of tropical forests in recent decades, some remnant populations are known to be small and isolated. Thus, information on its ecology, including infectious diseases, is critical for conservation efforts and management of populations of this emblematic species in the wild. Avian Mycobacteriosis (AM) is a chronic disease affecting a wide range of birds and mammals and clinical cases have been sporadically reported, although in harpy eagles, has not been documented. In addition, scant information exists on pathologies affecting raptors, therefore, this report expands the knowledge on infectious diseases affecting wild birds. This study describes the first case of AM in an immature harpy eagle rescued from Darien gap and presents details of the clinical manifestation of the disease and its histological findings.
   Case: An immature harpy eagle was presented to a rescue center after being confiscated by Ministry of Environment from a local farm in a remote region of Eastern Panama, in the Darien gap. The raptor had a history of having been kept in captivity for approximately five weeks, cohabiting with backyard poultry and fed corn, raw duck and chicken provided by farm owners. Stagnant water was offered for drinking. The harpy eagle arrived to the facility very lethargic and emaciated. Physical examination revealed damaged plumage, poor body condition and dyspnea. Complete blood count revealed anemia and leukocytosis based on lymphocytosis and eosinophilia. Biochemical profile evidenced an increased level of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), phosphorus and total plasma protein. Most remarkable radiographic findings were splenomegaly, hepatomegaly and increased opacity in kidneys, intestines, and aerial sacs. None of the other diagnostic tests performed were conclusive, like tracheal, esophageal and cloacal cultures for fungal infection and fecal exam. After one week of treatment, it showed a remarkable recovery, but at the end of the second week, declined dramatically, dying in the third week of treatment. Post-mortem examination revealed the presence of diffuse granulomas in multiple organs. Histologic examination with gram and Ziehl Neelsen staining revealed the presence of gram-positive and acid-fast bacteria, compatible with Mycobacterium-like bacilli. PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the hsp65, digested with BstEII and HaEIII restriction enzymes confirmed the presence Mycobacterium avium complex in tissues samples.
   Discussion: This is the first report of AM in a harpy eagle, presenting an extreme emaciation with dyspnea, abnormalities in spleen, liver and air sacs. Biochemical and hematological parameters revealed alterations consistent with infection and organ malfunctions in liver, but Mycobacteriosis was not suspected initially and it was necessary to support the diagnosis with histopathological studies and DNA amplification for a proper identification of the disease. This allowed us to confirm that ante-mortem clinical diagnosis of Avian Mycobacteriosis can be challenging, especially in birds who usually show non-specific signs of the disease and external lesions are not commonly observed. Further studies are requiring to determine the characteristics and clinical signs of this disease in this and other raptors. Also, to determine the source of infection affecting raptors and other protected species in the Neotropical region, especially for diseases with relevance in the conservation of birds and animal health control.

TI  - Soil texture prediction using portable X-ray fluorescence spectrometry and visible near-infrared diffuse reflectance spectroscopy
T2  - GEODERMA
AB  - Portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) spectrometry and visible near-infrared diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (Vis-NIR DRS), used separately or in tandem, have become important techniques for determination and prediction of soil attributes worldwide. However, there is little information available regarding the effectiveness of their combined use in tropical soils. This study aimed to predict soil texture using pXRF and Vis-NIR DRS, evaluating the efficiency of using these proximal sensors separately and in tandem. A total of 315 soil samples were collected from A and B horizons in Brazil. Soil samples were submitted to analyses of texture, pXRF and Vis-NIR DRS. Vis-NIR DRS spectral data pre-processing was evaluated by comparing results delivered by the derivative smoothing methods Savitzky-Golay (WT), Savitzky-Golay with Binning (WB), and data without the pre-processing treatment (WOT). Four algorithms were utilized for predictions: Gaussian Process (Gaussian), Support Vector Machine with linear (SVM-L) and radial (SVM-R) kernels, and Random Forest (RF). In general, models using only pXRF data slightly outperformed models using Vis-NIR DRS (WT, WB, WOT) data alone. Models combining data from both sensors achieved similar results to those obtained by pXRF alone. The best predictions of sand, silt, and clay contents were obtained via pXRF + RF using B horizon data, reaching R2 values of 0.91, 0.81, and 0.83, respectively. Although pXRF alone provided slightly better results, soil texture can be accurately predicted via both pXRF and Vis-NIR DRS data, separately and in tandem. These sensors can contribute to reduce costs and time required for tropical soil texture determination.

TI  - Feeding habits of mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) in an area of sylvatic transmission of yellow fever in the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF VENOMOUS ANIMALS AND TOXINS INCLUDING TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background: The reintroduction of sylvatic yellow fever in the state of Sao Paulo after about six decades was confirmed in the Northwestern region in 2000, where in 2008 there also occurred an important epizootic. The purpose of this study was to investigate the feeding habits of culicids potentially involved in the sylvatic transmission of the virus in this region.
   Methods: Specimens were collected in 24 forested localities at ground level with hand nets and mouth aspirators. Collections were made quarterly between October 2006 and July 2008 during daylight hours. Blood-meal identification was carried out in mosquitoes of the tribes Aedini, Mansoniini and Sabethini. The biotin/avidin sandwich ELISA was employed to determine six source types: bird, bovine, equine, rat, human and monkey.
   Results: A total of 24,879 females of the three tribes were obtained, 245 (0.98%) of which were engorged. The presence of three different blood sources per engorged female was the predominant situation, and included 35.10% of the total of samples processed. Samples with two or four different sources were represented by 25.31% and 25.71%, of the specimens, respectively, while just 9.39% had only one type and 1.22%, five different sources. Aedes scapularis, Ae. serratus (Group), Psorophora albigenu and Ps. ferox were the most abundant species and accounted for about 95% of the engorged specimens. Of the principal vector species, Haemagogus janthinomys/capricornii was found with bird, bovine and primate blood. These sources were predominant and alternated top ranking as the most frequent source according to the mosquito species and collection site. In general, primate blood was the most prevalent source.
   Conclusions: The human population of the region visits this ecotone frequently, which indicates the need for the periodical assessment of vaccination coverage against yellow fever. The frequency of non-human primate blood source in mosquito species that show minor vector importance in yellow fever virus transmission deserves attention. The eclectic feeding habits and some aspects of the interactions between potential vectors and reservoirs of yellow fever may be associated with the habitat fragmentation characteristic of the region. We recommend that further studies on the capacity and vector competence be performed on secondary vectors in extra-Amazonian region.

TI  - Frugivory in Four Sympatric Lemurs: Implications for the Future of Madagascar's Forests
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY
AB  - Although some conservationists accept that not all species can be saved, we illustrate the difficulty in deciding which species are dispensable. In this article, we examine the possibility that the integrity of a forest relies on its entire faunal assemblage. In Madagascar, one faunal group, the lemurs, accounts for the greatest biomass and species richness among frugivores. For example, 7 of the 13 sympatric lemur species in Madagascar's eastern rainforests consume primarily fruit. Because of this, we suggest that some tree species may rely heavily on particular lemur taxa for both seed dispersal and germination. In Ranomafana National Park, the diets for four of the day-active lemur frugivores have been documented during annual cycles over a 5-year period. We predicted that, although the fruit of some plant taxa would be exploited by multiple lemur species, the fruit of others would be eaten by one lemur species alone. Analyses reveal that while lemurs overlap in a number of fruit taxa exploited, 46% (16/35) of families and 56% (29/52) of genera are eaten exclusively by one lemur species. We, therefore, predict local changes in forest composition and structure if certain of these lemur species are eliminated from a forest owing to hunting, disease, or habitat disturbance. We also suggest that this result may be of global significance because carbon sequestration by the tropical forests in Madagascar may be reduced as a result of this predicted change in forest composition.

TI  - Ecological characterization of the aquatic habitats of mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) in enzootic foci of Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus in western Venezuela
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - We studied the aquatic mosquito habitats in and around enzootic foci of Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis virus (VEE) in western Venezuela. Specimens were sampled for 5 mo in three types of vegetation: tall lowland tropical forests, short inundated/secondary growth forests, and pastures/herbaceous vegetation around forests. Ground pools, flooded pastures, swamps, ponds, and canals predominated. We used a multivariate statistical approach to quantitatively assess the relationships of mosquito species with broad categories of the landscape, and with environmental variables within each aquatic habitat. Twenty-four mosquito species in the genera Aedes, Psorophora, Culex, Mansonia, and Uranotaenia were collected. Species richness was higher in the tall forests than in other types of vegetation. Discriminant Function Analysis showed a strong association between landscape category and mosquito species assemblage and identified Culex erraticus Dyar & Knab and Mansonia titillans Walker as indicator species of open areas, and Aedes serratus Theobald as an indicator of tall forests. M. titillans, Uranotaenia geometrica Theobald, Cx. erraticus, and Culex dunni Dyar were associated with unshaded, warm, vegetated waters in flooded pastures and swamps, whereas Ae. serratus, Aedes fulvus (Wiedemann), Psorophora albipes Theobald, Psorophora ferox (Humboldt), Culex caudelli Dyar & Knab, and Culex pedroi Sirivanakarn & Belkin were associated with small, shaded ground pools within the tall forests. Culex coronator Dyar & Knab was associated with partially exposed sites within short forests. These results allowed us to interpret better our previous studies on mosquito adult spread in the study area and their possible role as VEEV disseminators.

TI  - A note on amphibian decline in a central Amazonian lowland forest
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - The massive reductions in amphibian populations taking place across the globe are unprecedented in modern times. Within the Neotropics, the enigmatic decline of amphibians has been considered predominantly a montane phenomenon; however, recent evidence suggests amphibian and reptile populations in lowland forests in Central America are waning as well. Unfortunately, very little baseline data are available for conducting large scale time series studies in order to further investigate and confirm declines in the lowland forests of tropical America. Here we compare leaf litter herpetofauna abundance at sites in the Central Amazon, sampled first in 1984-1985 and again in 2007. We find no evidence for a decline in abundance or biomass of amphibians over a period of 22 years at this site. This conclusion differs markedly from the decline of 75% in amphibian populations over 35 years at a lowland site in Costa Rica. To explore potential declines in lowland Neotropical amphibian populations in detail, we suggest that existing baseline data be comprehensively compiled and analyzed for previously sampled sites and that these sites be re-sampled using comparable methodologies.

TI  - Global risk model for vector-borne transmission of Zika virus reveals the role of El Nino 2015
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
AB  - Zika, a mosquito-borne viral disease that emerged in South America in 2015, was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the WHO in February of 2016. We developed a climate-driven R-0 mathematical model for the transmission risk of Zika virus (ZIKV) that explicitly includes two keymosquito vector species: Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. The model was parameterized and calibrated using the most up to date information from the available literature. It was then driven by observed gridded temperature and rainfall datasets for the period 1950-2015. We find that the transmission risk in South America in 2015 was the highest since 1950. This maximum is related to favoring temperature conditions that caused the simulated biting rates to be largest and mosquito mortality rates and extrinsic incubation periods to be smallest in 2015. This event followed the suspected introduction of ZIKV in Brazil in 2013. The ZIKV outbreak in Latin America has very likely been fueled by the 2015-2016 El Nino climate phenomenon affecting the region. The highest transmission risk globally is in South America and tropical countries where Ae. aegypti is abundant. Transmission risk is strongly seasonal in temperate regions where Ae. albopictus is present, with significant risk of ZIKV transmission in the southeastern states of the United States, in southern China, and to a lesser extent, over southern Europe during the boreal summer season.

TI  - Spatial terrain analysis for matching native tree species to sites: A methodology
T2  - NEW FORESTS
AB  - This methodology has been developed to predict the distribution of preferable biophysical sites for three of the favored plantation species for private land rehabilitation in the Atherton Tablelands of tropical north Queensland: Araucaria cunninghamii, Eucalyptus cloeziana, and Flindersia brayleyana. The site prediction is expressed in a spatial and quantitative form of site classification. The sites (termed 'toposites') are characterized by soil and terrain qualities using spatial analytical techniques afforded by the predictive capacity of DTMs (digital terrain models) and conceptual regolith-terrain relationships in an explicit approach to forest site analysis through a geographic information system (GIS). Knowledge-based relationships and recorded soil-topographic data are used in this methodology to create conceptual models of climatic, terrain and parent material interaction. These guide the algorithms for digital terrain analysis through use of transfer functions and topographic DTM derivatives. Spatial regolith-terrain attribute predictions for potential toposites from DTMs are then combined with modeled climatic surfaces. The spatial arrangement of potentially favorable toposites for each of the selected species can be portrayed in raster format involving fuzzy classification. This form of classification provides multiple membership values for given regolith-terrain attributes for each grid cell. These can then be grouped as desired in an a posteriori classification to produce 'toposite preference' in raster or vector map form.

TI  - The Brazilian cattle sector: Status, prospects and controversies
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS-REVUE CANADIENNE D AGROECONOMIE
AB  - The cattle sector in Brazil (and in other countries of South America) is substantial in terms of size and potential impacts in world markers. Due to the sheer magnitude and potential of the Brazilian cattle sector, it merits out. attention. A trend to more productive cattle systems, new rules for trade in livestock products and more effective control of hoof and mouth disease in some ar eas of Brazil could cause it to become a more formidable beef importer. Brazil also warrants attention because of the controversial practice of deforestation for cattle production in the Amazon rain forest. A vocal environmental lobby has decried cattle production in the Amazon, but this practice continues. This paper reviews the status, prospects and controversies of the beef sector in Brazil, with a special focus on deforestation and cattle production in tropical ecosystems.

The disease has been known in Guinea since 1960 but only anectodical acute cases have been reported to date. In January 2019, a 35-year-old man, a wood merchant from Kissidougou, Forest Guinea, presented himself at several health centers with persistent fever, frequent vomiting and joint pain. He was repeatedly treated for severe malaria, and died three weeks later in Mamou regional hospital. Differential diagnosis identified LASV as the cause of death. No secondary cases were reported. The complete LASV genome was obtained using next-generation sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis showed that this strain, namely the Kissidougou strain, belongs to the clade IV circulating in Guinea and Sierra Leone, and is thought to have emerged some 150 years ago. Due to the similarity of symptoms with malaria, Lassa fever is still a disease that is difficult to recognize and that may remain undiagnosed in health centers in Guinea.

TI  - Effects of logging on gastrointestinal parasite infections and infection risk in African primates
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - 1. The impact of habitat disturbance on biodiversity conservation and animal health is poorly understood. Selective logging results in a suite of alterations that may increase infection risk and susceptibility to infection in resident populations.
   2. The aim of this study was to improve our understanding of this interplay by examining the effects of logging on infection risk and gastrointestinal parasite infections in three primate species whose populations have responded differently to selective logging in Kibale National Park, Uganda. Populations of redtail guenons Cercopithecus ascanius are declining in logged forest; red colobus Piliocolobus tephrosceles populations are in a state of slow recovery; and black-and-white colobus Colobus guereza populations are increasing in logged forest.
   3. We collected faecal samples from these three primate species over a period of 5 years in logged and undisturbed forest, to compare parasite infection prevalence and the magnitude of multiple infections. We also analysed canopy and ground vegetation plots to compare environmental contamination with primate parasites in logged and undisturbed forest.
   4. The prevalence and richness of gastrointestinal helminth and protozoan parasite infections, and the magnitude of multiple infections were greater for redtail guenons in logged than undisturbed forest, but these parameters did not differ between forest types for either colobine. Data from the canopy and ground vegetation plots revealed that infective stages of two representative generalist primate parasites occurred at higher densities in logged compared with undisturbed forest, signifying a greater infection risk for all primate species in logged forest.
   5. Synthesis and applications. This study demonstrates that selective logging can be associated with changes in an important ecological association between hosts and parasites. Our results indicate that anthropogenic habitat change could influence patterns of parasite infection in primates with associated effects on population performance.

TI  - Importance of microenvironment to arbovirus vector distribution in an urban area, Sao Paulo, Brazil
T2  - REVISTA DA SOCIEDADE BRASILEIRA DE MEDICINA TROPICAL
AB  - Introduction: The study of the landscape ecology, biological microhabitat, and epidemiological implications for the distribution of the main vectors Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus contribute to the prevention and control actions regarding the diseases they transmit. Methods: This study sought to assess data on positive properties of the vector control program activities from 1998 to 2010. An entomological survey was also carried out on a sample of buildings collecting larvae and pupae from containers between October and April (spring / summer) from 2002 to 2005. We assessed the physico-chemical data of the water in 20% of positive containers. The vegetation and urbanization were assessed with the aid of satellite images and microenvironments were classified as urbanized, woods, and shrubs. The data were analyzed using statistical and geoprocessing software. Results: Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus colonized all types of microhabitats and microenvironments, predominantly in the urbanized area, in isolation and in coexistence. The microhabitat of Ae. aegypti showed a temperature gradient greater than that of Ae. albopictus, and there was an association with urbanized areas for the first species and wooded areas for the last species. Conclusions: Landscape ecology and intra-urban differences favor different microclimates, which contribute to the coexistence of species in the urban environment in an area close to the forest, raising the risk of other arbovirus infections in urban areas. The ecological niche should be considered for Ae. albopictus. Entomological and virologic monitoring are suggested as arbovirus surveillance actions in urban infested centers near preserved forests.

TI  - Ecology, evolution, and the long-term surveillance of vector-borne Chagas disease: A multi-scale appraisal of the tribe Rhodniini (Triatominae)
T2  - ACTA TROPICA
AB  - Chagas disease incidence has sharply declined over the last decade. Long-term disease control will, however, require extensive, longitudinal surveillance systems capable of detecting (and dealing with) reinvasion-reinfestation of insecticide-treated dwellings by non-domiciliated triatomines. Sound surveillance design calls for reliable data on vector ecology, and these data must cover different spatial scales. We conducted a multi-scale assessment of ecological and evolutionary trends in members of the tribe Rhodniini, including (i) a macroscale analysis of Rhodniini species richness and composition patterns across the Americas, and (ii) a detailed, mesoscale case-study of ecological and behavioural trends in Rhodnius neglectus and R. nasutus. Our macroscale overview provides some comprehensive insights about key mechanisms/processes probably underlying ecological and genetic diversification in the Rhodniini. These insights translate into a series of testable hypotheses about current species distributions and their likely causes. At the landscape scale, we used geometric morphometrics to identify dubious specimens as either R. neglectus or P, nasutus (two near-sibling species), and studied palm tree populations of these two vector taxa in five geographical areas. The data suggest that deforestation and the associated loss of habitat and host diversity might increase the frequency of vector-human contact (and perhaps Trypanosoma cruzi infection rates in vectors). Surveillance in central-northeastern Brazil should prioritise deforested landscapes where large palm trees (e.g., Attalea, Mauritia, Copernicia, Acrocomia or Syagrus) occur near houses. We anticipate that, by helping define the distribution patterns and ecological preferences of each species, multi-scale research will significantly strengthen vector surveillance systems across Latin America.

TI  - Integrating human behavior and snake ecology with agent-based models to predict snakebite in high risk landscapes
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Snakebite causes more than 1.8 million envenoming cases annually and is a major cause of death in the tropics especially for poor farmers. While both social and ecological factors influence the chance encounter between snakes and people, the spatio-temporal processes underlying snakebites remain poorly explored. Previous research has heavily focused on statistical correlates between snakebites and ecological, sociological, or environmental factors, but the human and snake behavioral patterns that drive the spatio-temporal process have not yet been integrated into a single model. Here we use a bottom-up simulation approach using agent-based modelling (ABM) parameterized with datasets from Sri Lanka, a snakebite hotspot, to characterise the mechanisms of snakebite and identify risk factors. Spatio-temporal dynamics of snakebite risks are examined through the model incorporating six snake species and three farmer types (rice, tea, and rubber). We find that snakebites are mainly climatically driven, but the risks also depend on farmer types due to working schedules as well as species present in landscapes. Snake species are differentiated by both distribution and by habitat preference, and farmers are differentiated by working patterns that are climatically driven, and the combination of these factors leads to unique encounter rates for different landcover types as well as locations. Validation using epidemiological studies demonstrated that our model can explain observed patterns, including temporal patterns, and relative contribution of bites by each snake specie. Our predictions can be used to generate hypotheses and inform future studies and decision makers. Additionally, our model is transferable to other locations with high snakebite burden as well.
   Author summary
   Snakebite is a neglected tropical disease affecting millions, and a major cause of death of agricultural workers in the tropics. In this research, the authors have developed a simulation model that includes data for agricultural activity across the days and seasons, as well as snake behavioral patterns, and the times and locations humans and snakes meet. Using this model, they predicted observed seasonal snakebite patterns in Sri Lanka, and they successfully showed how these patterns vary between different agricultural activities, including seasonal rice cultivation, and rubber and tea harvests. The findings arising from this study demonstrate that different combinations of human and snake activity, including species and farming practice differences, are likely to generate differences in snakebite patterns across locations. This model could be applied to analyze and predict snakebite in tropical regions around the globe to help mitigate the problem.

TI  - A brief inventory of sand flies (Diptera, Psychodidae) from the National Forest of the Rio Preto, State of the Espirito Santo, southeastern Brazil
T2  - BIOTA NEOTROPICA
AB  - The inventories on sand flies are usually conducted for a long period in leishmaniasis-endemic regions. Thus, there is little data on the sand fly fauna in areas where no leishmaniasis cases have been reported. Therefore, we conducted an inventory to study the sand fly fauna in the National Forest of Rio Preto (NFRP). We carried out a brief inventory by using four CDC light traps in 2009 during winter and summer. We collected 1,403 sand flies belonging to 11 genera and 22 species. As expected, we did not find in the NFRP region sand flies species that have been reported as vectors of Leishmania. However, we found some species of sand flies with few records and that rarely have been reported in southeastern Brazil. Nevertheless, the diversity and species richness of the sand flies in NFRP were similar to those reported in other Atlantic Forest conservation areas. Hence, we drew the following conclusions: (i) it is necessary to carry out inventories not only in leishmaniasis-endemic areas but also in areas with no records of this disease; and (ii) brief inventories can be useful in describing the sand fly fauna in such areas.

TI  - Epidemiology of malaria transmission in forest and plain ecotype villages in Sundargarh District, Orissa, India
T2  - TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - A study of the epidemiology of malaria transmission was undertaken in 13 tribal villages located in forest and plain areas of Sundargarh District of Orissa state, India, from January 2001 to December 2003. In forest areas, intense transmission of malaria is attributed to the highly anthropophagic vector Anopheles fluviatilis sibling species S and is complemented by A. culicifacies sibling species C. In plain areas, A. culicifacies sibling species C is responsible for malaria transmission. The entomological inoculation rate in the forest and plain areas was 0.311 and 0.014 infective bites/person/night, respectively, during 2003. Malaria transmission is perennial both in forest and plain areas but is markedly tow in the plain area compared with the forest area. Plasmodium falciparum accounted for 85.0% of the total malaria cases during the study period. In forest and plain areas, the number of P falciparum cases per 1000 population per year was 284.1 and 31.2, respectively, whereas the parasite rate was 14.0% and 1.7%, respectively. In forest areas, clinical malaria occurs more frequently in children aged 0-5 years and declines gradually with increasing age. The study showed that villages in forest and plain areas separated by short geographical distances have distinct epidemiology of malaria transmission.

TI  - Patterns of avian haemosporidian infections vary with time, but not habitat, in a fragmented Neotropical landscape
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Habitat loss has the potential to alter vertebrate host populations and their interactions with parasites. Theory predicts a decrease in parasite diversity due to the loss of hosts in such contexts. However, habitat loss could also increase parasite infections as a result of the arrival of new parasites or by decreasing host immune defenses. We investigated the effect of habitat loss and other habitat characteristics on avian haemosporidian infections in a community of birds within a fragmented landscape in northwest Ecuador. We estimated Plasmodium and Haemoproteus parasite infections in 504 individual birds belonging to 8 families and 18 species. We found differences in infection status among bird species, but no relationship between forest fragment characteristics and infection status was observed. We also found a temporal effect, with birds at the end of the five-month study (which ran from the end of the rainy season thru the dry season), being less infected by Plasmodium parasites than individuals sampled at the beginning. Moreover, we found a positive relationship between forest area and Culicoides abundance. Taken as a whole, these findings indicate little effect of fragment characteristics per se on infection, although additional sampling or higher infection rates would have offered more power to detect potential relationships.

TI  - Using Molecular Epidemiology to Track <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> from Terrestrial Carnivores to Marine Hosts: Implications for Public Health and Conservation
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background: Environmental transmission of the zoonotic parasite Toxoplasma gondii, which is shed only by felids, poses risks to human and animal health in temperate and tropical ecosystems. Atypical T. gondii genotypes have been linked to severe disease in people and the threatened population of California sea otters. To investigate land-to-sea parasite transmission, we screened 373 carnivores (feral domestic cats, mountain lions, bobcats, foxes, and coyotes) for T. gondii infection and examined the distribution of genotypes in 85 infected animals sampled near the sea otter range.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Nested PCR-RFLP analyses and direct DNA sequencing at six independent polymorphic genetic loci (B1, SAG1, SAG3, GRA6, L358, and Apico) were used to characterize T. gondii strains in infected animals. Strains consistent with Type X, a novel genotype previously identified in over 70% of infected sea otters and four terrestrial wild carnivores along the California coast, were detected in all sampled species, including domestic cats. However, odds of Type X infection were 14 times higher (95% CI: 1.3-148.6) for wild felids than feral domestic cats. Type X infection was also linked to undeveloped lands (OR = 22, 95% CI: 2.3-250.7). A spatial cluster of terrestrial Type II infection (P = 0.04) was identified in developed lands bordering an area of increased risk for sea otter Type II infection. Two spatial clusters of animals infected with strains consistent with Type X (P <= 0.01) were detected in less developed landscapes.
   Conclusions: Differences in T. gondii genotype prevalence among domestic and wild felids, as well as the spatial distribution of genotypes, suggest co-existing domestic and wild T. gondii transmission cycles that likely overlap at the interface of developed and undeveloped lands. Anthropogenic development driving contact between these cycles may increase atypical T. gondii genotypes in domestic cats and facilitate transmission of potentially more pathogenic genotypes to humans, domestic animals, and wildlife.

TI  - Scented at day and night: diel variation in the floral scent chemistry of the threatened tree<i> Amburana</i><i> cearensis</i> (Leguminosae) and effects of this variation on its pollinators
T2  - FLORA
AB  - The reproductive success of most angiosperms depends on pollinators. A combination of floral traits, including olfactory cues, are involved in attracting these animals. The emission and chemical composition of floral volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is often associated with the sensory preferences of the most frequent floral visitors. However, the relationship between VOCs and nocturnal and diurnal pollinators is poorly known in tropical dry forests. Our study describes the dynamics of floral scent chemistry throughout the anthesis of Amburana cearensis (Leguminosae) and its association with floral visitors in the Caatinga dry forest, one of the largest expanses of seasonally dry tropical forest (SDTF) in the world. The species is a threatened tree with high socioeconomic importance in the Caatinga and other SDTFs of South America (exploited for timber and medicinal uses). Its flowers emit an intense, pleasant and sweet fragrance throughout anthesis, starting at-16:00 h and ending at-15:00 h of the following day (lasting 23 h). We used dynamic headspace sampling and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to collect and analyze the floral scent within a natural population. The fragrance of A. cearensis was characterized by the dominant presence of monoterpenes, especially linalool and (Z)-linalool oxide (furanoid) and (Z)-linalool oxide (pyranoid), as well as (E,E)-alpha-farnesene and an aromatic benzenoid, benzyl alcohol. The relative proportions of floral VOCs emitted by A. cearensis changed during anthesis, with a marked presence of linalool in daytime samples (day: 45% / night: 27%) and furanoid (Z)-linalool oxide at night (day: 12% / night: 29%). The dominance of benzyl alcohol, linalool and its oxides in the floral scent of A. cearensis is possibly related to the attraction of nocturnal and diurnal Lepidoptera as pollen vectors. Indeed, we observed six species of butterflies and seven species of moths pollinating the flowers of A. cearensis in 41 h of observations. However, other terpenoids in the fragrant blend possibly contribute to the attraction of additional diurnal floral visitors, including bees, which are also effective pollinators. The continuous scent production throughout anthesis, and the changes in floral scent with a peak of linalool production during the day, may be related to the wide spectrum of pollinators of A. cearensis. This association between floral visitors and dynamics of VOCs presentation may therefore increase the reproductive success of the species, which only blooms every two years and is strictly self-incompatible.

TI  - Small mammals from the Caatinga: A dataset for the Brazilian semiarid biome
T2  - ECOLOGY
AB  - The Caatinga is an exclusively Brazilian biome, and is the largest and most biodiverse Seasonal Tropical Dry Forest in the world. Despite that, the mammalian fauna, especially small mammals, is the least studied of all Brazilian biomes. In order to fill gaps and provide detailed information on small mammals (Didelphimorphia, Rodentia) in the Caatinga biome, we compiled reliable records focusing on richness, composition and some biometric data. These records came from mammal collections, papers, theses, books, and unpublished data, prioritizing records with vouchers housed in scientific collections. We compiled a total of 3133 records from 816 locations, resulting in a richness of 47 native species (12 marsupials and 35 rodents, plus three exotic rodents, Rattus rattus, Rattus norvegicus, and Mus musculus). This dataset includes records of three new species for the biome and its transition zone: the rodents Calomys mattevii, Holochilus oxe, and Nectomys squamipes. Of the total number of records, 1808 (57.71%) are from consulting activities, 95 (3.03%) are from zoonoses studies and 104 (3.32%) are from the National Plague Service (SNP). All nine Brazilian states with territory in the Caatinga have sampling data for small mammals, but the number of records and localities are unevenly distributed, with the state of Rio Grande do Norte having the lowest number of records and locations sampled. Our dataset is the first of its kind for the Caatinga biome and has considerable potential value for studies of habitat use, landscape ecology, macroecology, biogeography, and conservation. There are no copyright restrictions on the data. Please cite this data paper when the data are used in publications. We also request that researchers and teachers inform us of how they are using the data.

TI  - Landscape Pattern Analysis and Bayesian Modeling for Predicting <i>Oncomelania hupensis</i> Distribution in Eryuan County, People's Republic of China
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Detailed knowledge of how local landscape patterns influence the distribution of Oncomelania hupensis, the intermediate host snail of Schistosoma japonicum, might facilitate more effective schistosomiasis control. We selected 12 villages in a mountainous area of Eryuan County, Yunnan Province, People's Republic of China, and developed Bayesian geostatistical models to explore heterogeneities of landscape composition in relation to distribution of O. hapensis. The best-fitting spatio-temporal model indicated that the snail density was significantly correlated with environmental factors. Specifically, snail density was positively correlated with wetness and inversely correlated with the normalized difference vegetation index and mollusciciding, and snail density decreased as landscape patterns became more uniform. However, the distribution of infected snails was not significantly correlated with any of the investigated environmental factors and landscape metrics. Our enhanced understanding of O. hupensis ecology is important for spatial targeting of schistosomiasis control interventions.

TI  - Ecologic Features of Plague Outbreak Areas, Democratic Republic of the Congo, 2004-2014
T2  - EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB  - During 2004-2014, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) declared 54% of plague cases worldwide. Using national data, we characterized the epidemiology of human plague in DRC for this period. All 4,630 suspected human plague cases and 349 deaths recorded in DRC came from Orientale Province. Pneumonic plague cases (8.8% of total) occurred during 2 major outbreaks in mining camps in the equatorial forest, and some limited outbreaks occurred in the Ituri highlands. Epidemics originated in 5 health zones clustered in Ituri, where sporadic bubonic cases were recorded throughout every year. Classification and regression tree characterized this cluster by the dominance of ecosystem 40 (mountain tropical climate). In conclusion, a small, stable, endemic focus of plague in the highlands of the Ituri tropical region persisted, acting as a source of outbreaks in DRC.

TI  - Fine-scale variation in microclimate across an urban landscape shapes variation in mosquito population dynamics and the potential of <i>Aedes albopictus</i> to transmit arboviral disease
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Most statistical and mechanistic models used to predict mosquito borne disease transmission incorporate climate drivers of disease transmission by utilizing environmental data collected at geographic scales that are potentially coarser than what mosquito populations may actually experience. Temperature and relative humidity can vary greatly between indoor and outdoor environments, and can be influenced strongly by variation in landscape features. In the Aedes albopictus system, we conducted a proof-of-concept study in the vicinity of the University of Georgia to explore the effects of fine-scale microclimate variation on mosquito life history and vectorial capacity (VC). We placed Ae. albopictus larvae in artificial pots distributed across three replicate sites within three different land uses-urban, suburban, and rural, which were characterized by high, intermediate, and low proportions of impervious surfaces. Data loggers were placed into each larval environment and in nearby vegetation to record daily variation in water and ambient temperature and relative humidity. The number of adults emerging from each pot and their body size and sex were recorded daily. We found mosquito microclimate to significantly vary across the season as well as with land use. Urban sites were in general warmer and less humid than suburban and rural sites, translating into decreased larval survival, smaller body sizes, and lower per capita growth rates of mosquitoes on urban sites. Dengue transmission potential was predicted to be higher in the summer than the fall. Additionally, the effects of land use on dengue transmission potential varied by season. Warm summers resulted in a higher predicted VC on the cooler, rural sites, while warmer, urban sites had a higher predicted VC during the cooler fall season.

TI  - Scenarios for Resilient Shrimp Aquaculture in Tropical Coastal Areas
T2  - ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
AB  - We contend there are currently two competing scenarios for the sustainable development of shrimp aquaculture in coastal areas of Southeast Asia. First, a landscape approach, where farming techniques for small-scale producers are integrated into intertidal areas in a way that the ecological functions of mangroves are maintained and shrimp farming diseases are controlled. Second, a closed system approach, where problems of disease and effluent are eliminated in closed recirculation ponds behind the intertidal zone controlled by industrial-scale producers. We use these scenarios as two ends of a spectrum of possible interactions at a range of scales between the ecological, social, and political dynamics that underlie the threat to the resilience of mangrove forested coastal ecosystems. We discuss how the analytical concepts of resilience, uncertainty, risk, and the organizing heuristic of scale can assist us to understand decision making over shrimp production, and in doing so, explore their use in the empirical research areas of coastal ecology, shrimp health management and epidemiology, livelihoods, and governance in response to the two scenarios. Our conclusion focuses on a series of questions that map out a new interdisciplinary research agenda for sustainable shrimp aquaculture in coastal areas.

TI  - Two novel species of <i>Calonectria</i> isolated from soil in a natural forest in China
T2  - MYCOKEYS
AB  - Species of Calonectria include important pathogens of numerous agronomic and forestry crops worldwide, and they are commonly distributed in soils of tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Previous research results indicated that species diversity of Calonectria in China is relatively high. Most Calonectria spp. reported and described from China were obtained from diseased Eucalyptus tissues or soils in Eucalyptus plantations established in tropical and subtropical areas in southern China. Recently, a number of Calonectria isolates were isolated from soils in a natural forest in the temperate region of central China. These isolates were identified by DNA sequence comparisons for the translation elongation factor 1-alpha (tef1), histone H3 (his3), calmodulin (cmdA) and beta-tubulin (tub2) gene regions, combined with morphological characteristics. Two novel species of Calonectria were identified and described, and are named here as Calonectria lichi and Ca. montana, which reside in the Prolate Group and Sphaero-Naviculate Group, respectively. This study revealed that more species of Calonectria may occur in natural forests in central China than previously suspected.

TI  - Transforming Palmyra Atoll to native-tree dominance will increase net carbon storage and reduce dissolved organic carbon reef runoff
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Native forests on tropical islands have been displaced by non-native species, leading to calls for their transformation. Simultaneously, there is increasing recognition that tropical forests can help sequester carbon that would otherwise enter the atmosphere. However, it is unclear if native forests sequester more or less carbon than human-altered landscapes. At Palmyra Atoll, efforts are underway to transform the rainforest composition from coconut palm (Cocos nucifera) dominated to native mixed-species. To better understand how this landscape-level change will alter the atoll's carbon dynamics, we used field sampling, remote sensing, and parameter estimates from the literature to model the total carbon accumulation potential of Palmyra's forest before and after transformation. The model predicted that replacing the C. nucifera plantation with native species would reduce aboveground biomass from 692.6 to 433.3 Mg C. However, expansion of the native Pisonia grandis and Heliotropium foertherianum forest community projected an increase in soil carbon to at least 13,590.8 Mg C, thereby increasing the atoll's overall terrestrial carbon storage potential by 11.6%. Nearshore sites adjacent to C. nucifera canopy had a higher dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration (110.0 mu MC) than sites adjacent to native forest (81.5 mu MC), suggesting that, in conjunction with an increase in terrestrial carbon storage, replacing C. nucifera with native forest will reduce the DOC exported from the forest into in nearshore marine habitats. Lower DOC levels have potential benefits for corals and coral dependent communities. For tropical islands like Palmyra, reverting from C. nucifera dominance to native tree dominance could buffer projected climate change impacts by increasing carbon storage and reducing coral disease.

TI  - Cacao boom and bust: sustainability of agroforests and opportunities for biodiversity conservation
T2  - CONSERVATION LETTERS
AB  - Cacao cultivation holds a sweet promise, not only for chocolate consumers and cacao farmers but also for conservationists who argue that diverse cacao agroforests may be used to sustain both livelihoods of smallholders and ecological benefits such as the conservation of biodiversity within human-dominated tropical landscapes. However, regional boom-and-bust cycles are the rule in global cacao production: after initial forest conversion to cacao agroforests, sustaining production is difficult due to dwindling yields as trees age and pest and disease pressure increases. The failure to revitalize plantations often leads to a shift of cacao production to other regions. Shade removal dynamics within these cycles substantially reduce most of the biodiversity benefits. We investigate the conservation implications of these processes. Using examples from the current cacao crisis in Indonesia, we show that until now commitments to sustainability by the cacao-chocolate sector have not been successful, which endangers remaining forests. Conservation can be combined with smallholder cacao production, but if this is to be achieved, greater quantitative and qualitative efforts to halt cacao cycles are needed on the part of the industry by making use of existing opportunities to combine sustainability, carbon storage, and biodiversity conservation.

TI  - Sustainable access to deworming drugs in a changing landscape
T2  - LANCET INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB  - The global effort to control and eliminate soil-transmitted helminthiasis (STH) currently depends on donations of albendazole and mebendazole, which reached more than 530 million children in 2016. As we approach 2020, the WHO goal of eliminating STH as a public health problem will not be met in most endemic countries, and ongoing treatment will be necessary. Additionally, the volume of drugs required might increase because global strategies for STH aim to interrupt transmission. Under the 2012 London Declaration on Neglected Tropical Diseases, pharmaceutical company commitments to donate drugs to control or eliminate neglected tropical diseases extend to 2020. We are approaching a period of uncertainty regarding different strategies for control and elimination of STH, the size and target populations for future donations, and optimum drugs and drug combinations. Long-term reliance on large-scale donation of deworming drugs is not sustainable. The global STH community need to develop a strategy to secure a sustainable global supply of affordable and effective anthelmintic drugs. This strategy should include improvement of the quality of generic drugs through innovative technical partnerships.

TI  - Sandflies (Diptera, Psychodidae) from forest areas in Botucatu municipality, central western Sao Paulo State, Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF VENOMOUS ANIMALS AND TOXINS INCLUDING TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background: The study of the distribution and ecology of sandfly species is essential for epidemiological surveillance and estimation of the transmission risk of Leishmania spp. infection.
   Findings: In the present study, sandflies were captured in native fragmented forest areas in Rubiao Junior district, Botucatu municipality, Sao Paulo state, Brazil, between September 2001 and January 2005. A minimum of two automatic light traps were installed per night from 6 pm to 8 am, in different months, resulting in approximately 900 collecting hours. During this period, 216 sandfly specimens of sixteen species were captured. Pintomyia monticola and Brumptomyia guimaraesi were the most abundant with 56 specimens (25.93%) captured per species, followed by Pintomyia fischeri 28 (12.96%) and Psathyromyia pascalei 18 (8.33%). Other captured species were Lutzomyia amarali, Sciopemyia sordellii, Psathyromyia aragaoi, Nyssomyia whitmani, Migonemyia migonei, Pintomyia bianchigalatiae, Pintomyia misionensis, Brumptomyia carvalheiroi, Brumptomyia cardosoi, Brumptomyia cunhai, Brumptomyia nitzulescui, Brumptomyia brumpti and Brumptomyia spp. represented by 58 (26.85%) specimens.
   Conclusions: Although less frequently found, the presence of Pintomyia fischeri, Nyssomyia whitmani and Migonemyia migonei, known vectors of Leishmania braziliensis, indicates risk of American cutaneous leishmaniasis occurrence. Moreover, the absence of Lutzomyia longipalpis-the main vector of Leishmania infantum chagasi, which is the agent of American visceral leishmaniasis-suggests that there is no risk of introduction and establishment of this disease in the studied area.

TI  - A New Machine Learning Approach in Detecting the Oil Palm Plantations Using Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - The rapid expansion of oil palm is a major driver of deforestation and other associated damage to the climate and ecosystem in tropical regions, especially Southeast Asia. It is therefore necessary to precisely detect and monitor oil palm plantations to safeguard the ecosystem services and biodiversity of tropical forests. Compared with optical data, which are vulnerable to cloud cover, the Sentinel-1 dual-polarization C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) acquires global observations under all weather conditions and times of day and shows good performance for oil palm detection in the humid tropics. However, because accurately distinguishing mature and young oil palm trees by using optical and SAR data is difficult and considering the strong dependence on the input parameter values when detecting oil palm plantations by employing existing classification algorithms, we propose an innovative method to improve the accuracy of classifying the oil palm type (mature or young) and detecting the oil palm planting area in Sumatra by fusing Landsat-8 and Sentinel-1 images. We extract multitemporal spectral characteristics, SAR backscattering values, vegetation indices, and texture features to establish different feature combinations. Then, we use the random forest algorithm based on improved grid search optimization (IGSO-RF) and select optimal feature subsets to establish a classification model and detect oil palm plantations. Based on the IGSO-RF classifier and optimal features, our method improved the oil palm detection accuracy and obtained the best model performance (OA = 96.08% and kappa = 0.9462). Moreover, the contributions of different features to oil palm detection are different; nevertheless, the optimal feature subset performed the best and demonstrated good potential for the detection of oil palm plantations.

TI  - Participatory monitoring reveals village-centered gradients of mammalian defaunation in central Africa
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Tropical areas are facing a bushmeat crisis involving the systematic over-exploitation of large-bodied mammals for both subsistence and commercial purposes. We hypothesize that because hunting generally originates from villages, it will create "halos of defaunation" where abundances of large mammals increase with distance away from villages. Whilst such patterns have been well characterized at the landscape scale, examining how de-faunation halos vary between different villages has received considerably less attention. Forests immediately surrounding villages are of considerable importance to the people residing within them and the factors hypothesized to influence local defaunation halos (e.g. village size, hunting practices and access to local markets) may affect local livelihoods and the ecological integrity of nearby forests. To address this, we adopted a participatory approach to establish and monitor sixty transects across ten village-distance gradients (1-8 km) in Gabon. Trained paraecologists, recruited from local villages, walked each transect twice monthly to determine the encounter rates of medium and large mammals across the village distance gradient and monitored village level bushmeat availability.
   We found that overall rates of mammal observation and estimated species richness were constant across the village-distance gradient, however the total number of individuals encountered and bushmeat biomass were lower close to villages consistent with local depletion of wildlife. These general trends were underpinned by depleted mammal species diversity with increasing proximity to villages and a marked shift in mammal community composition: small, non-hunted species were encountered most frequently near villages, whereas large, hunted species were encountered most frequently away from villages. We found some evidence for inter-village variation in the strength and depth of defaunation halos, which may be driven in part by the village-level hunting intensity. Several of the key parameters identified in landscape-scale bushmeat studies did not detectably influence village-level defaunation (e.g. road or market distance). Despite the prevalence of bushmeat hunting in the region, the conservation value of forests immediately surrounding villages was demonstrated through the detection of large-bodied species of conservation concern (e.g. chimpanzee and gorilla) at a high proportion of survey locations.
   The compositional shifts in mammal communities detailed here will ultimately lead to the altered composition and diversity of forests around villages, with potential implications for human livelihoods, health and transmission of zoonotic disease. This research also demonstrates the effectiveness of engaging paraecologists to answer focused ecological questions - the first step in facilitating effective natural resource management by local communities.

TI  - Janzen-Connell effects shape gene flow patterns and realized fitness in the tropical dioecious tree <i>Spondias purpurea</i> (ANACARDIACEAE)
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Pollination and seed dispersal patterns determine gene flow within plant populations. In tropical forests, a high proportion of trees are dioecious, insect pollinated and dispersed by vertebrates. Dispersal vectors and density dependent factors may modulate realized gene flow and influence the magnitude of Fine Scale Genetic Structure (FSGS), affecting individual fitness. Spondias purpurea is a vertebrate-dispersed, insect-pollinated dioecious tropical tree. We assessed the influence of sex ratio, effective and realized gene flow on genetic diversity, FSGS and individual fitness within a 30ha plot in the tropical dry forest reserve of Chamela-Cuixmala, Mexico. All individuals within the plot were tagged, geo-referenced and sampled for genetic analysis. We measured dbh and monitored sex expression during two reproductive seasons for all individuals. We collected seeds directly from maternal trees for effective pollen dispersal analysis, and analyzed established seedlings to assess realized pollen and seed dispersal. Nine microsatellite loci were used to describe genetic diversity parameters, FSGS and gene flow patterns among different size classes. A total of 354 individuals were located and classified into three size classes based on their dbh (<10, 10-20, and >20cm). Population sex ratios were male biased and diametric size distributions differed among sexes, these differences may be the result of precocious male reproduction at early stages. Autocorrelation analyses indicate low FSGS (Fj <0.07) across all size classes. Long realized pollen and seed dispersal and differences among effective and realized gene flow were detected. In our study site low FSGS is associated with high gene flow levels. Effective and realized gene flow indicate a population recruitment curve indicating Janzen-Connell effects and suggesting fitness advantages for long-distance pollen and seed dispersal events.

TI  - Land use change in Asia and the ecological consequences
T2  - ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH
CP  - Symposium on Ecological Impacts of Asia on Global Sustainability at Multiple Scales
AB  - Viewed within a historical context, Asia has experienced dramatic land transformations, and currently more than 50% of Asian land area is under agriculture. The consequences of this transformation are manifold. Southeast Asia has the highest deforestation rate of any major tropical region. Many of the world's large rivers and lakes in Asia have been heavily degraded. About 11 of 19 world megacities with more than 10 million inhabitants are in Asia. These land use activities have resulted in substantial negative ecological consequences, including increased anthropogenic CO2 emissions, deteriorated air and water quality, alteration of regional climate, an increase of disease and a loss of biodiversity. Although land use occurs at the local level, it has the potential to cause ecological impact across local, regional and global scales. Reducing the negative environmental impacts of land use change while maintaining economic viability and social acceptability is an major challenge for most developing countries in Asia.

TI  - Seroprevalence of Dengue, Zika, and Chikungunya Viruses in Wild Monkeys in Thailand
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Zoonotic pathogens such as arboviruses have comprised a significant proportion of emerging infectious diseases in humans. The role of wildlife species as reservoirs for arboviruses is poorly understood, especially in endemic areas such as Southeast Asia. This study aims to determine the exposure history of different macaque species from national parks in Thailand to mosquito-borne flaviviruses and alphavirus by testing the serum samples collected from 25 northern pigtailed macaques, 33 stump-tailed macaques, and 4 long-tailed macaques for the presence of antibodies against dengue, Zika, and chikungunya viruses by plaque reduction neutralization assay. Specific neutralizing antibodies against Dengue virus (DENV1-4) and Zika virus (ZIKV) were mainly found in stump-tailed macaques, whereas neutralizing antibody titers were not detected in long-tailed macaques and pigtailed macaques as determined by 90% plaque reduction neutralization assay (PRNT90). One long-tailed macaque captured from the south of Thailand exhibited antibody titers against chikungunya virus (CHIKV), suggesting enzootic of this virus to nonhuman primates (NHPs) in Thailand. Encroachment of human settlements into the forest has increased the interface that exposes humans to zoonotic pathogens such as arboviruses found in monkeys. Nonhuman primates living in different regions of Thailand showed different patterns of arboviral infections. The presence of neutralizing antibodies among wild monkeys in Thailand strongly suggests the existence of sylvatic cycles for DENV, ZIKV, and CHIKV in Thailand. The transmission of dengue, Zika, and chikungunya viruses among wild macaques may have important public health implications.

Akodon montensis. a sigmodontine species that harbors Jabora and Ape Aime hantaviruses On the basis of mark-recapture sampling of 3 locales during 2 years. this report provides comparative data on populational and other characteristics of the species near its distributional limit, in the Upper Parana Atlantic Forest in Paraguay We found A montensis to be almost exclusively terrestrial (nonarboreal) and to vary in population density among locales and between years. findings consistent with earlier studies. Population density was not related either to neotropical seasonality or to most precipitation variables, but sex ratio varied seasonally, which has not been reported previously We evaluated the seroprevalence of hantavirus in A montensis. in association with external. populational, and individual variables As in most previous studies of rodent hantavirus systems, seroprevalence varied among sampling locales and was higher among males However, unlike previous reports. especially those from North America. we did not find a correspondence between seroplevalence and population density. seasonal variation, or most precipitation variables Simple and direct associations between seroprevalence levels and either seasonality or precipitation may be less characteristic of humid neotropical or subtropical systems Our analyses revealed that seropositive animals exhibit several noteworthy behavioral and hie-history modifications, in particular that they have larger home ranges than do seronegatives, exhibit greater maximum distance moved, have greater home range displacement between sampling sessions. particularly those individuals that are seroconvertmg during the same period, and have greater longevity, especially among males In general. these characteristics could be postulated as favorable to the capacity of the virus to be transmitted horizontally to other hosts DOI. 10 1644/09-MAMM-A-152.1.

TI  - Enzymatic stoichiometry in tropical soil under pure and mixed plantations of eucalyptus with N<sub>2</sub>-fixing trees
T2  - SCIENTIA AGRICOLA
AB  - Soil enzymes play a fundamental role in nutrient cycling in forest systems. The stoichiometry of C, N, and P-acquiring enzymes has been used to indicate nutrient limitation in the soil. However, the enzymatic stoichiometry remains poorly understood in pure and mixed eucalypt plantations. Thus, this study aims to assess the activity of enzymes in the soil to address the hypothesis that the introduction of N-2-fixing trees could influence the enzymatic stoichiometry on C, N, and P cycling. The activity of beta-glucosidase (BG), urease (U), and acid phosphatase (AP) was assessed in soil (0-20 cm depth) of pure Eucalyptus grandis without (E) and with N fertilization (E+N), and a mixed system with E. grandis and Acacia mangium (E+A), and a pure A. mangium (A) plantation at 27 and 39 months after planting. The activities of BG/U, BG/AP, and U/AP were used to calculate the enzyme C/N, C/P, and N/P ratios, respectively. Rates of N-acquiring enzymes were higher in E and E+N, while soil microorganisms invested in P-acquiring enzymes in A and E+A. The vector length and angle demonstrated that C demand by microorganisms does not change in relation to N and P, regardless of the treatment. However, N demand decreased in relation to P in A and E+A (mainly at 27 months). Our results suggest that enzymes activity in pure eucalypt systems is limited for their soil-litter nutrient contents. At the same time while acacia and mixed plantation seem to invest in P-acquiring enzymes to improve biological N-2 fixation promoted by diazotrophic bacteria associated to acacia.

TI  - TROPICAL PASTURE ESTABLISHMENT .4. POPULATION-DYNAMICS OF SOWN SPECIES IN DEVELOPING PASTURES
T2  - TROPICAL GRASSLANDS
CP  - Workshop on Tropical Pasture Establishment
AB  - The persistence of introduced species in pastures depends on the survival of plants from the original sowing, and the recruitment of new plants to maintain or increase population size. Recruitment can be by vegetative expansion but in many species it is by seedlings.
   The population dynamics of 4 legume species (Stylosanthes hamata, S. scabra, Macroptilium atropurpureum and Cassia rotundifolia) are outlined, and the importance of seed production and soil seed banks for persistence of these species is highlighted. The effects of management (grazing, fertiliser, fire, pests and diseases) on survival, soil seed levels and recruitment are outlined, and examples are given of how these effects are reflected in changes in pasture composition. Some management guidelines based on the understanding derived from these demographic studies are presented.
   Most paddocks are not uniform, and the influence of variation across landscapes on the development and dynamics of pastures is also considered. Recruitment and mortality vary across landscapes with management and seasonal conditions. Examples are presented of success and failure in different parts of a paddock, and of temporary loss of a species at the quadrat level but survival at the paddock scale.

TI  - Disturbance pharmacopoeias: Medicine and myth from the humid tropics
T2  - ANNALS OF THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN GEOGRAPHERS
AB  - The much-publicized quest for miracle drug plants in tropical rainforests has provided compelling support for the preservationist agenda. This article questions the assumptions that underpin this claim, particularly the myth that pristine forest represents the primary repository of nature's medicinal providence. After tracing colonial European efforts at medicinal plant discovery, intellectual property exploitation, and plant transference and acclimation, I review the recent resurgence of scientific interest in tropical folk pharmacopoeias. In spite of the image marketed by environmental entrepreneurs, the medicinal foraging preference of rural tropical groups is largely successional mosaics of their own creation-trails, kitchen gardens, swiddens, and forest fallows. Focusing on the subsistence transition from hunting and gathering to small-scale cultivation, I propose that disturbance pharmacopoeias are the logical outcome of changing subsistence strategies, ecological processes, and disease patterns. Salient, familiar, accessible, and rich in bioactive compounds, anthropogenic nature represents the ideal tropical medicine chest. Whereas bioprospecting enterprises carried out during the colonial period and at present employ similar rhetoric-deadly disease, miracle cures, and fantastic profits-these endeavors were in the past and continue to be buttressed by fictitious notions of virgin tropical nature and the mysterious healing powers of its "primitives."

TI  - The prevalence of Leptospira among invasive small mammals on Puerto Rican cattle farms
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Leptospirosis, an emerging infectious disease caused by bacteria of the genus Leptospira, is thought to be the most widespread zoonotic disease in the world. A first step in preventing the spread of Leptospira is delineating the animal reservoirs that maintain and disperse the bacteria. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) methods targeting the LipL32 gene were used to analyze kidney samples from 124 House mice (Mus musculus), 94 Black rats (Rattus rattus), 5 Norway rats (R. norvegicus), and 89 small Indian mongooses (Herpestes auropunctatus) from five cattle farms in Puerto Rico. Renal carriage of Leptospira was found in 38% of the sampled individuals, with 59% of the sampled mice, 34% of Black rats, 20% of Norway rats, and 13% of the mongooses. A heterogeneous distribution of prevalence was also found among sites, with the highest prevalence of Leptospira-positive samples at 52% and the lowest at 30%. Comparative sequence analysis of the LipL32 gene from positive samples revealed the presence of two species of Leptospira, L. borgpetersenii and L. interrogans in mice, detected in similar percentages in samples from four farms, while samples from the fifth farm almost exclusively harbored L. interrogans. In rats, both Leptospira species were found, while mongooses only harbored L. interrogans. Numbers tested for both animals, however, were too small (n = 7 each) to relate prevalence of Leptospira species to location. Significant associations of Leptospira prevalence with anthropogenic landscape features were observed at farms in Naguabo and Sabana Grande, where infected individuals were closer to human dwellings, milking barns, and ponds than were uninfected individuals. These results show that rural areas of Puerto Rico are in need of management and longitudinal surveillance of Leptospira in order to prevent continued infection of focal susceptible species (i.e. humans and cattle).
   Author summary Leptospirosis is a global zoonotic disease that recently has shown an increase of human cases in many regions, Puerto Rico being one of them. To decrease human Leptospira infections it is necessary to ascertain the role of animal reservoirs to maintain the pathogen in the environment. However, no studies of wild mammal reservoirs in Puerto Rico have been done since 1963. We addressed the prevalence of Leptospira in four species of introduced wild mammals, which included three commensal rodent species (Mus and Rattus spp.) and the small Indian mongoose (Herpestes auropunctatus) on dairy farms in Puerto Rico. Pathogen prevalence ranged from high to moderate in mice and mongooses, respectively. We also found that the pathogen is not distributed homogeneously among the sites we sampled and that landscape features, both natural and manmade, can play a role in the distribution of Leptospira. Our study provides an initial exploration of wild mammal reservoirs for Leptospira in Puerto Rico, and our data highlight the need for management of these species to potentially decrease pathogen transmission rates in both humans and cattle.

TI  - Mixed Effects of Habitat Degradation and Resources on Hantaviruses in Sympatric Wild Rodent Reservoirs within a Neotropical Forest
T2  - VIRUSES-BASEL
AB  - Understanding the ecology of rodent-borne hantaviruses is critical to assessing the risk of spillover to humans. Longitudinal surveys have suggested that hantaviral prevalence in a given host population is tightly linked to rodent ecology and correlates with changes in the species composition of a rodent community over time and/or habitat composition. We tested two hypotheses to identify whether resource addition and/or habitat composition may affect hantavirus prevalence among two sympatric reservoir hosts in a neotropical forest: (i) increased food resources will alter the rodent community and thus hantaviral prevalence; and (ii) host abundance and viral seroprevalence will be associated with habitat composition. We established a baseline of rodent-virus prevalence in three grid pairs of distinct habitat compositions and subjected one grid of each pair to resource augmentation. Increased rodent species diversity was observed on grids where food was added versus untreated control grids during the first post-treatment sampling session. Resource augmentation changed species community composition, yet it did not affect the prevalence of hantavirus in the host population over time, nor was there evidence of a dilution effect. Secondly, we show that the prevalence of the virus in the respective reservoir hosts was associated with habitat composition at two spatial levels, independent of resource addition, supporting previous findings that habitat composition is a primary driver of the prevalence of hantaviruses in the neotropics.

TI  - Distribution of phlebotomine sand fly genotypes (<i>Lutzomyia shannoni</i>, Diptera: Psychodidae) across a highly heterogeneous landscape
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - Genetic variability of eight Colombian field populations and two laboratory colonies of a tropical forest sand ny, Lutzomyia shannoni Dyar, was assessed by comparing allozyme frequencies at 20 enzyme loci. Substantial genetic variability was noted in all strains, with mean heterozygosities of 13-21% and alleles per locus of 2.0-2.8. Four loci were monomorphic. Six populations in north and central Colombia showed close genetic similarity (Nei's distances, 0.01-0.09), despite mountainous environment, discontinuous forest habitat, and elevation differences from 125 to 1,220 m. Two samples representing the Orinoco (near Villavicencio) and Amazon (near Leticia) river basins were similar (Nei's distance, 0.08) but diverged substantially from the central six samples (Nei's distances, 0.26-0.40). Although the range of L, shannoni extends from the southeastern United States to northern Argentina, three genetically distinct, geographically discrete, groups were discerned by the current analysis: Orinoco-Amazon river basins, north-central Colombia, and eastern United States.

TI  - Toxin-resolved antivenomics-guided assessment of the immunorecognition landscape of antivenoms
T2  - TOXICON
AB  - Snakebite envenoming represents a major issue in rural areas of tropical and subtropical regions across sub-Saharan Africa, South to Southeast Asia, Latin America and Oceania. Antivenoms constitute the only scientifically validated therapy for snakebite envenomings, provided they are safe, effective, affordable, accessible and administered appropriately. However, the lack of financial incentives in a technology that has remained relatively unchanged for more than a century, has contributed to some manufacturers leaving the market and others downscaling production or increasing the prices, leading to a decline in the availability and accessibility for these life-saving antidotes to millions of rural poor most at risk from snakebites in low income countries. The shortage of antivenoms can be significantly alleviated by optimizing the use of current antivenoms (through the assessment of their specific and paraspecific efficacy against the different medically relevant homologous and heterologous snake venoms) and by generating novel polyspecific antivenoms exhibiting broad clinical spectrum and wide geographic distribution range. Research on venoms has been continuously enhanced by advances in technology. Particularly, the last decade has witnessed the development of omics strategies for unravelling the toxin composition of venoms ("venomics") and to assess the immunorecognition profile of antivenoms ("antivenomics"). Here, we review recent developments and reflect on near future innovations that promise to revolutionize the mutually enlightening relationship between evolutionary and translational venomics.

TI  - Nutrient Transport Within and Between Habitats Through Seed Dispersal Processes by Woolly Monkeys in North-Western Amazonia
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY
AB  - The contribution of vertebrate animals to nutrient cycling has proven to be important in various ecosystems. However, the role of large bodied primates in nutrient transport in neotropical forests is not well documented. Here, we assess the role of a population of woolly monkeys (Lagothrix lagothricha lugens) as vectors of nutrient movement through seed dispersal. We estimated total seed biomass transported by the population within and between two habitats (terra firme and flooded forests) at Tinigua Park, Colombia, and quantified potassium (K), phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) content in seeds of 20 plant species from both forests. Overall, the population transported an estimated minimum of 11.5 (+/- 1.2 SD) g of potassium, 13.2 (+/- 0.7) g of phosphorus and 34.3 (+/- 0.1) g nitrogen, within 22.4 (+/- 2.0) kg of seeds ha(-1) y(-1). Approximately 84% of all nutrients were deposited in the terra firme forest mostly through recycling processes, and also through translocation from the flooded forest. This type of translocation represents an important and high-quality route of transport since abiotic mechanisms do not usually move nutrients upwards, and since chemical tests show that seeds from flooded forests have comparatively higher nutrient contents. The overall contribution to nutrient movement by the population of woolly monkeys is significant because of the large amount of biomass transported, and the high phosphorus content of seeds. As a result, the phosphorus input generated by these monkeys is of the same order of magnitude as other abiotic mechanisms of nutrient transport such as atmospheric deposition and some weathering processes. Our results suggest that via seed dispersal processes, woolly monkey populations can contribute to nutrient movement in tropical forests, and may act as important nutrient input vectors in terra firme forests.

TI  - Species Classification in a Tropical Alpine Ecosystem Using UAV-Borne RGB and Hyperspectral Imagery
T2  - DRONES
AB  - Paramos host more than 3500 vascular plant species and are crucial water providers for millions of people in the northern Andes. Monitoring species distribution at large scales is an urgent conservation priority in the face of ongoing climatic changes and increasing anthropogenic pressure on this ecosystem. For the first time in this ecosystem, we explored the potential of unoccupied aerial vehicles (UAV)-borne red, green, and blue wavelengths (RGB) and hyperspectral imagery for paramo species classification by collecting both types of images in a 10-ha area, and ground vegetation cover data from 10 plots within this area. Five plots were used for calibration and the other five for validation. With the hyperspectral data, we tested our capacity to detect five representative paramo species with different growth forms using support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) classifiers in combination with three feature selection methods and two class groups. Using RGB images, we could classify 21 species with an accuracy greater than 97%. From hyperspectral imaging, the highest accuracy (89%) was found using models built with RF or SVM classifiers combined with a binary grouping method and the sequential floating forward selection feature. Our results demonstrate that paramo species can be accurately mapped using both RGB and hyperspectral imagery.

TI  - Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System integrated with solar zenith angle for forecasting sub-tropical Photosynthetically Active Radiation
T2  - FOOD AND ENERGY SECURITY
AB  - Advocacy for climate mitigation aims to minimize the use of fossil fuel and to support clean energy adaptation. While alternative energies (e.g., biofuels) extracted from feedstock (e.g., micro-algae) represent a promising role, their production requires reliably modeled photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). PAR models predict energy parameters (e.g., algal carbon fixation) to aid in decision-making at PAR sites. Here, we model very short-term (5-min scale), sub-tropical region's PAR with an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System model with a Centroid-Mean (ANFIS-CM) trained with a non-climate input (i.e., only the solar angle, theta(Z)). Accuracy is benchmarked against genetic programming (GP), M5Tree, Random Forest (RF), and multiple linear regression (MLR). ANFIS-CM integrates fuzzy and neural network algorithms, whereas GP adopts an evolutionary approach, M5Tree employs binary decision, RF employs a bootstrapped ensemble, and MLR uses statistical tools to link PAR with theta(Z). To design the ANFIS-CM model, 5-min theta(Z) (01-31 December 2012; 0500H-1900H) for sub-tropical, Toowoomba are utilized to extract predictive features, and the testing accuracy (i.e., differences between measurements and forecasts) is evaluated with correlation (r), root-mean-square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), Willmott (WI), Nash-Sutcliffe (E-NS), and Legates & McCabes (E-LM) Index. ANFIS-CM and GP are equivalent for 5-min forecasts, yielding the lowest RMSE (233.45 and 233.01 mu mol m(-2)s(-1)) and MAE (186.59 and 186.23 mu mol m(-2)s(-1)). In contrast, MLR, M5Tree, and RF yields higher RMSE and MAE [(RMSE = 322.25 mu mol m(-2)s(-1), MAE = 275.32 mu mol m(-2)s(-1)), (RMSE = 287.70 mu mol m(-2)s(-1), MAE = 234.78 mu mol m(-2)s(-1)), and (RMSE = 359.91 mu mol m(-2)s(-1), MAE = 324.52 mu mol m(-2)s(-1))]. Based on normalized error, ANFIS-CM is considerably superior (MAE = 17.18% versus 19.78%, 34.37%, 26.39%, and 30.60% for GP, MLR, M5Tree, and RF models, respectively). For hourly forecasts, ANFIS-CM outperforms all other methods (WI = 0.964 vs. 0.942, 0.955, 0.933 & 0.893, and E-LM = 0.741 versus 0.701, 0.728, 0.619 & 0.490 for GP, MLR, M5Tree, and RF, respectively). Descriptive errors support the versatile predictive skills of the ANFIS-CM model and its role in real-time prediction of the photosynthetic-active energy to explore biofuel generation from micro-algae, studying food chains, and supporting agricultural precision.

TI  - Multispecies comparison of host responses to <i>Fusarium circinatum</i> challenge in tropical pines show consistency in resistance mechanisms
T2  - PLANT CELL AND ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Fusarium circinatum poses a threat to both commercial and natural pine forests. Large variation in host resistance exists between species, with many economically important species being susceptible. Development of resistant genotypes could be expedited and optimised by investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying host resistance and susceptibility as well as increasing the available genetic resources. RNA-seq data, from F. circinatum inoculated and mock-inoculated ca. 6-month-old shoot tissue at 3- and 7-days postinoculation, was generated for three commercially important tropical pines, Pinus oocarpa, Pinus maximinoi and Pinus greggii. De novo transcriptomes were assembled and used to investigate the NLR and PR gene content within available pine references. Host responses to F. circinatum challenge were investigated in P. oocarpa (resistant) and P. greggii (susceptible), in comparison to previously generated expression profiles from Pinus tecunumanii (resistant) and Pinus patula (susceptible). Expression results indicated crosstalk between induced salicylate, jasmonate and ethylene signalling is involved in host resistance and compromised in susceptible hosts. Additionally, higher constitutive expression of sulfur metabolism and flavonoid biosynthesis in resistant hosts suggest involvement of these metabolites in resistance.

TI  - Oviposition behavior of wild yellow fever vector mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) in an Atlantic Forest fragment, Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Although there are many studies on the control of mosquito vectors of the yellow fever virus (YFV) in tropical forests, there are still few ecological studies regarding abiotic factors effect on these mosquitoes. Here we characterize these effects on oviposition behavior, abundance, and diversity of mosquito vectors of YFV. The study was conducted in Corrego da Luz Municipal Park, in Casimiro de Abreu, Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil, from July 2018 to December 2019. Ovitraps were placed at ground level and 3 m high. The data were tested for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test, followed by an independent sample analysis, the Mann-Whitney test. The Shannon Diversity Index was used to evaluate the abundance of mosquitos' eggs collected at both ground level and 3 m high. We highlight the presence of Haemagogus janthinomys and Hg. leucocelaenus, primary YFV vectors in forest areas. The abundance of Hg. leucocelaenus (63%), Hg. janthinomys (75%), and Aedes terrens (58%) was higher at the height of 3 m, while Ae. albopictus (52%) was higher at ground level. Aedes albopictus was positively correlated with temperature. Culicidae monitoring is essential for assessing the YFV transmission cycle in Atlantic forest fragments.

TI  - Host Life History Strategy, Species Diversity, and Habitat Influence <i>Trypanosoma cruzi</i> Vector Infection in Changing Landscapes
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background: Anthropogenic land use may influence transmission of multi-host vector-borne pathogens by changing diversity, relative abundance, and community composition of reservoir hosts. These reservoir hosts may have varying competence for vector-borne pathogens depending on species-specific characteristics, such as life history strategy. The objective of this study is to evaluate how anthropogenic land use change influences blood meal species composition and the effects of changing blood meal species composition on the parasite infection rate of the Chagas disease vector Rhodnius pallescens in Panama.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: R. pallescens vectors (N = 643) were collected in different habitat types across a gradient of anthropogenic disturbance. Blood meal species in DNA extracted from these vectors was identified in 243 (40.3%) vectors by amplification and sequencing of a vertebrate-specific fragment of the 12SrRNA gene, and T. cruzi vector infection was determined by pcr. Vector infection rate was significantly greater in deforested habitats as compared to contiguous forests. Forty-two different species of blood meal were identified in R. pallescens, and species composition of blood meals varied across habitat types. Mammals (88.3%) dominated R. pallescens blood meals. Xenarthrans (sloths and tamanduas) were the most frequently identified species in blood meals across all habitat types. A regression tree analysis indicated that blood meal species diversity, host life history strategy (measured as r(max), the maximum intrinsic rate of population increase), and habitat type (forest fragments and peridomiciliary sites) were important determinants of vector infection with T. cruzi. The mean intrinsic rate of increase and the skewness and variability of r(max) were positively associated with higher vector infection rate at a site.
   Conclusions/Significance: In this study, anthropogenic landscape disturbance increased vector infection with T. cruzi, potentially by changing host community structure to favor hosts that are short-lived with high reproductive rates. Study results apply to potential environmental management strategies for Chagas disease.

TI  - Fecal parasite risk in the endangered proboscis monkey is higher in an anthropogenically managed forest environment compared to a riparian rain forest in Sabah, Borneo
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Understanding determinants shaping infection risk of endangered wildlife is a major topic in conservation medicine. The proboscis monkey, Nasalis larvatus, an endemic primate flagship species for conservation in Borneo, is endangered through habitat loss, but can still be found in riparian lowland and mangrove forests, and in some protected areas. To assess socioecological and anthropogenic influence on intestinal helminth infections in N. larvatus, 724 fecal samples of harem and bachelor groups, varying in size and the number of juveniles, were collected between June and October 2012 from two study sites in Malaysian Borneo: 634 samples were obtained from groups inhabiting the Lower Kinabatangan Wildlife Sanctuary (LKWS), 90 samples were collected from groups of the Labuk Bay Proboscis Monkey Sanctuary (LBPMS), where monkeys are fed on stationary feeding platforms. Parasite risk was quantified by intestinal helminth prevalence, host parasite species richness (PSR), and eggs per gram feces (epg). Generalized linear mixed effect models were applied to explore whether study site, group type, group size, the number of juveniles per group, and sampling month predict parasite risk. At the LBPMS, prevalence and epg of Trichuris spp., strongylids, and Strongyloides spp. but not Ascaris spp., as well as host PSR were significantly elevated. Only for Strongyloides spp., prevalence showed significant changes between months; at both sites, the beginning rainy season with increased precipitation was linked to higher prevalence, suggesting the external life cycle of Strongyloides spp. to benefit from humidity. Higher prevalence, epgs, and PSR within the LBPMS suggest that anthropogenic factors shape host infection risk more than socioecological factors, most likely via higher re-infection rates and chronic stress. Noninvasive measurement of fecal parasite stages is an important tool for assessing transmission dynamics and infection risks for endangered tropical wildlife. Findings will contribute to healthcare management in nature and in anthropogenically managed environments.

TI  - Prediction of risk factors for scrub typhus from 2006 to 2019 based on random forest model in Guangzhou, China
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE & INTERNATIONAL HEALTH
AB  - Objectives: Scrub typhus is an increasingly serious public health problem, which is becoming the most common vector-borne disease in Guangzhou. This study aimed to analyse the correlation between scrub typhus incidence and potential factors and rank the importance of influential factors.Methods: We collected monthly scrub typhus cases, meteorological variables, rodent density (RD), Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and land use type in Guangzhou from 2006 to 2019. Correlation analysis and a random forest model were used to identify the risk factors for scrub typhus and predict the importance rank of influencing factors related to scrub typhus incidence.Results: The epidemiological results of the scrub typhus cases in Guangzhou between 2006 and 2019 showed that the incidence rate was on the rise. The results of correlation analysis revealed that a positive relationship between scrub typhus incidence and meteorological factors of mean temperature (T-mean), accumulative rainfall (RF), relative humidity (RH), sunshine hours (SH), and NDVI, RD, population density, and green land coverage area (all p < 0.001). Additionally, we tested the relationship between the incidence of scrub typhus and the lagging meteorological factors through cross-correlation function, and found that incidence was positively correlated with 1-month lag T-mean, 2-month lag RF, 2-month lag RH, and 6-month lag SH (all p < 0.001). Based on the random forest model, we found that the T-mean was the most important predictor among the influential factors, followed by NDVI.Conclusions: Meteorological factors, NDVI, RD, and land use type jointly affect the incidence of scrub typhus in Guangzhou. Our results provide a better understanding of the influential factors correlated with scrub typus, which can improve our capacity for biological monitoring and help public health authorities to formulate disease control strategies.

TI  - Impacts of climate change on plant diseases-opinions and trends
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PATHOLOGY
CP  - 9th Conference of the European-Foundation-for-Plant-Pathology
AB  - There has been a remarkable scientific output on the topic of how climate change is likely to affect plant diseases. This overview addresses the need for review of this burgeoning literature by summarizing opinions of previous reviews and trends in recent studies on the impacts of climate change on plant health. Sudden Oak Death is used as an introductory case study: Californian forests could become even more susceptible to this emerging plant disease, if spring precipitations will be accompanied by warmer temperatures, although climate shifts may also affect the current synchronicity between host cambium activity and pathogen colonization rate. A summary of observed and predicted climate changes, as well as of direct effects of climate change on pathosystems, is provided. Prediction and management of climate change effects on plant health are complicated by indirect effects and the interactions with global change drivers. Uncertainty in models of plant disease development under climate change calls for a diversity of management strategies, from more participatory approaches to interdisciplinary science. Involvement of stakeholders and scientists from outside plant pathology shows the importance of trade-offs, for example in the land-sharing vs. sparing debate. Further research is needed on climate change and plant health in mountain, boreal, Mediterranean and tropical regions, with multiple climate change factors and scenarios (including our responses to it, e.g. the assisted migration of plants), in relation to endophytes, viruses and mycorrhiza, using long-term and large-scale datasets and considering various plant disease control methods.

TI  - Woody Plant Encroachment in a Seasonal Tropical Savanna: Lessons about Classifiers and Accuracy from UAV Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Woody plant encroachment in grassy ecosystems is a widely reported phenomenon associated with negative impacts on ecosystem functions. Most studies of this phenomenon have been carried out in arid and semi-arid grasslands. Therefore, studies in tropical regions, particularly savannas, which are composed of grassland and woodland mosaics, are needed. Our objective was to evaluate the accuracy of woody encroachment classification in the Brazilian Cerrado, a tropical savanna. We acquired dry and wet season unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images using RGB and multispectral cameras that were processed by the support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), and random forest (RF) classifiers. We also compared two validation methods: the orthomosaic and in situ methods. We targeted two native woody species: Baccharis retusa and Trembleya parviflora. Identification of these two species was statistically (p < 0.05) most accurate in the wet season RGB images classified by the RF algorithm, with an overall accuracy (OA) of 92.7%. Relating to validation assessments, the in situ method was more susceptible to underfitting scenarios, especially using an RF classifier. The OA was higher in grassland than in woodland formations. Our results show that woody encroachment classification in a tropical savanna is possible using UAV images and field surveys and is suggested to be conducted during the wet season. It is challenging to classify UAV images in highly diverse ecosystems such as the Cerrado; therefore, whenever possible, researchers should use multiple accuracy assessment methods. In the case of using in situ accuracy assessment, we suggest a minimum of 40 training samples per class and to use multiple classifiers (e.g., RF and DT). Our findings contribute to the generation of tools that optimize time and cost for the monitoring and management of woody encroachment in tropical savannas.

T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY, VOL 127, 2014
CP  - 127th Annual Meeting of the Florida-State-Horticultural-Society (FSHS)
AB  - The avocado (Persea americana Miller) is an important fruit crop for subsistence farmers, small- and large-scale producers, throughout the tropics. In the lowlands of Tropical America, local selections of West Indian avocados dominate regional markets. These local West Indian avocado selections are often of superior fruit quality and adaptation to the climatic and edaphic conditions of the area. There has been little effort into the systematic identification, collection and maintenance of these West Indian avocado genetic resources from Tropical America. West Indian avocado selections have promise for South Florida as cultivars for plantation and estate agriculture. Working with local collaborators we have identified superior selections within localized areas of diversity, collected budwood and established a living collection at the Fairchild Farm Genetic Resource Center of Fairchild Tropical Botanic Gardens in South Florida. More than 200 different selections of West Indian Avocado were collected during four years. As a genetic resource, these selections hold promise for the improvement of disease resistance (e.g. Phytophthora root rot), fruit quality and productivity of avocado throughout Tropical America and the world. Evaluation of fruit and tree characteristics began in 2005 and we have now identified several green- and red-skinned cultivars with promise for commercial and landscape use in Florida and in Tropical America, Africa, and Asia.

TI  - The most frog-diverse place in Middle America, with notes on the conservation status of eight threatened species of amphibians
T2  - AMPHIBIAN & REPTILE CONSERVATION
AB  - Regarding amphibians, Costa Rica exhibits the greatest species richness per unit area in Middle America, with a total of 215 species reported to date. However, this number is likely an underestimate due to the presence of many unexplored areas that are difficult to access. Between 2012 and 2017, a monitoring survey of amphibians was conducted in the Central Caribbean of Costa Rica, on the northern edge of the Matama mountains in the Talamanca mountain range, to study the distribution patterns and natural history of species across this region, particularly those considered as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. The results show the highest amphibian species richness among Middle America lowland evergreen forests, with a notable anuran representation of 64 species. The greatest diversity in the study area occurred in the mature forest on the basal belt. Of the 68 amphibian species found, seven (10%) are endemic to the Atlantic versant and eight (11.6%) are threatened. This survey includes the first record of Gastrotheca cornuta in Costa Rica since it was last reported 21 years ago. New populations of Agalychnis lemur (Critically Endangered) and Duellmanohyla uranochroa (Endangered) are reported, and Ecnomiohyla veraguensis (Endangered) is reported for the first time in Costa Rica. These findings show that this locality is a high priority conservation area for a large number of amphibian species, which are often threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation.

TI  - Conserving wild Arabica coffee: Emerging threats and opportunities
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Climate change and emerging pests and diseases are posing important challenges to global crop productivity, including that of Arabica coffee. The genetic basis of commercially used Arabica coffee cultivars is extremely narrow, and it is uncertain how much genetic diversity is present in ex situ collections. Conserving the wild Arabica coffee gene pool and its evolutionary potential present in the montane forests of SW Ethiopia is thus critically important for maintaining coffee yield and yield stability worldwide. Globally, coffee agroforestry helps to conserve forest cover and forest biodiversity that cannot persist in open agricultural landscapes, but the conservation of the wild Arabica coffee gene pool requires other priorities than those that are usually set for conserving forest biodiversity in mixed tropical landscapes. We show how forest loss and degradation, coffee management, in particular production intensification, and the introduction of cultivars, are threatening the genetic integrity of these wild populations. We propose an active land sparing approach based on strict land use zoning to conserve the genetic resources and the in situ evolutionary potential of Arabica coffee and discuss the major challenges including the development of access and benefit sharing mechanisms for ensuring long-term support to conservation.

TI  - Seasonal and inter-annual drivers of yellow fever transmission in South America
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Author summary
   Yellow fever (YF) is a viral haemorrhagic fever found in tropical South America and Africa that affects both humans and non-human primates (NHPs). Despite a long-standing recognition of YF as a pathogen of significant public health concern, not much is known about why cases are reported in some years and not others, or what drives the strong seasonal trends that are observed in South America.
   Using a combination of statistical techniques, the authors have looked at the relationship between different types of land-use, vegetation, climate, human and NHP and the reporting of YF across all of South America and both inter-annual and seasonally over the period 2003-2016. The authors have found that both are highly influenced by changes in vegetation, however the inter-annual is additional influenced by land-cover and the seasonal climatic factors.
   The authors have found that the differing drivers of seasonal and inter-annual transmission, though both are predominantly shaped by changes in vegetation, highlighting the role of land-cover in influencing the inter-annual and climate the seasonal.
   This research enhances our understanding of YF transmission in South America, describing the geographic and temporal distribution of cases in relation to vegetation, land-cover and climate. This research is of particular importance, given the recent large-scale outbreaks of YF across the continent, global YF vaccination shortages and the exportation of cases globally.
   In the last 20 years yellow fever (YF) has seen dramatic changes to its incidence and geographic extent, with the largest outbreaks in South America since 1940 occurring in the previously unaffected South-East Atlantic coast of Brazil in 2016-2019. While habitat fragmentation and land-cover have previously been implicated in zoonotic disease, their role in YF has not yet been examined. We examined the extent to which vegetation, land-cover, climate and host population predicted the numbers of months a location reported YF per year and by each month over the time-period. Two sets of models were assessed, one looking at interannual differences over the study period (2003-2016), and a seasonal model looking at intra-annual differences by month, averaging over the years of the study period. Each was fit using hierarchical negative-binomial regression in an exhaustive model fitting process. Within each set, the best performing models, as measured by the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), were combined to create ensemble models to describe interannual and seasonal variation in YF. The models reproduced the spatiotemporal heterogeneities in YF transmission with coefficient of determination (R-2) values of 0.43 (95% CI 0.41-0.45) for the interannual model and 0.66 (95% CI 0.64-0.67) for the seasonal model. For the interannual model, EVI, land-cover and vegetation heterogeneity were the primary contributors to the variance explained by the model, and for the seasonal model, EVI, day temperature and rainfall amplitude. Our models explain much of the spatiotemporal variation in YF in South America, both seasonally and across the period 2003-2016. Vegetation type (EVI), heterogeneity in vegetation (perhaps a proxy for habitat fragmentation) and land cover explain much of the trends in YF transmission seen. These findings may help understand the recent expansions of the YF endemic zone, as well as to the highly seasonal nature of YF.

TI  - A comparison of classification techniques to support land cover and land use analysis in tropical coastal zones
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
AB  - This study assesses the performance of the support vector machine image classification technique in the context of a tropical coastal zone exhibiting low to medium scale development. The overall and individual classification results of this approach were compared to the maximum likelihood classifier and the artificial neural network techniques. A 15-m spatial resolution ASTER image of Koh Tao in Thailand was used for the test, and support vector machine was found to offer only limited improvements in classification accuracy over the other methodologies. The support vector machine did, however, show promise in dealing with the difficult challenge of separating human infrastructure such as buildings from other land cover types such as coastal rock and sandy beach which have very similar spectral signatures. The medium resolution ASTER image also proved highly suited to classifying coastal landscapes with this mix of land cover types. Additional research is needed to assess the full potential of the support vector machine in a weighted or layered classification, and to explore potential applications of this classification tool in other tropical environments.

T2  - EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB  - During February 2018-January 2019, we conducted large-scale surveillance for the presence and prevalence of tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) and louping ill virus (LIV) in sentinel animals and ticks in the United Kingdom. Serum was collected from 1,309 deer culled across England and Scotland. Overall, 4% of samples were ELISA-positive for the TBEV serocomplex. A focus in the Thetford Forest area had the highest proportion (47.7%) of seropositive samples. Ticks collected from culled deer within seropositive regions were tested for viral RNA; 5 of 2,041 ticks tested positive by LIV/TBEV real-time reverse transcription PCR, all from within the Thetford Forest area. From 1 tick, we identified a full-length genomic sequence of TBEV. Thus, using deer as sentinels revealed a potential TBEV focus in the United Kingdom. This detection of TBEV genomic sequence in UK ticks has important public health implications, especially for undiagnosed encephalitis.

TI  - The risk of Ross River and Barmah Forest virus disease in Queensland: Implications for New Zealand
T2  - AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Objectives: To describe the incidence of Ross River (RR) and Barmah Forest (BF) virus disease in Queensland and determine the risk of importation of RR virus from Queensland into New Zealand (NZ) via viraemic travellers.
   Methods: Based on routine RR and BF virus notification data of seven major urban tropical and subtropical Queensland populations, incidence rates adjusted for age, sex, season and a baseline level of immunity were used to examine the annual and seasonal risk of disease in the specific populations and selected subgroups. The risk for NZ was determined by estimating the number of infections among major visitor groups travelling from Queensland to NZ, using seroconversion rates.
   Results: In Queensland, annual rates of RR and BF virus disease ranged between 31.5-288.3 and 3.4-37.4/100,000 person years respectively and increased to between 48.4-423.5 and 3.8-40.4/100,000 person years at risk when adjusted for immunity, Our estimates indicate that more than 100 viraemic travellers may enter NZ from Queensland each year. Estimates were greatest among New Zealanders returning home.
   Conclusions and implications: Usefulness of notification data could be maximised by presenting more detailed information to the local governments responsible for the control and public health awareness of these pathogens. Given the high number of viraemic persons entering NZ, the abundance of possums and the emergence of Cc. camptorhynchus, transmission of RR virus within NZ is probable. Health authorities should prepare for a virgin soil epidemic of FIR virus by initiating serological and clinical surveillance in key areas, enhance public and professional awareness and elevate national resources necessary to invoke emergency vector control and case management.

TI  - 23 years of research on Teratosphaeria leaf blight of <i>Eucalyptus</i>
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - In Australia, during the course of the last two decades, plantation area of Eucalyptus has expanded dramatically. One of the most important threats to these trees, and to the forest industries they sustain, is a complex of fungal diseases broadly treated as Teratosphaeria Leaf Blight. The aim of this review is to summarise some of the most important findings relating to Teratosphaeria spp. (previously Kirramyces) associated with leaf and shoot blight of Eucalyptus. The review spans a period of 23 years since the description of the aptly named Teratosphaeria destructans. Six species of Teratosphaeria are associated with leaf and shoot blights of Eucalyptus and these are T. destructans, T. eucalypti, T. novaehollandiae, T. pseudoeucalypti, T. viscida and T. tiwiana. With the exception of T. destructans, all of these species have been found in Australia. Based on the damage they cause, the most significant of these fungi are T. destructans, T. pseudoeucalypti and T. viscida. Teratosphaeria viscida has been found only in the tropics of eastern Australia, while T. destructans and T. pseudoeucalypti have spread globally; T. destructans throughout Asia and South Africa and T. pseudoeucalypti into South America. Factors driving the development of these diseases have included the establishment of plantations adjacent to native eucalypt forests in Australia and planting on sites not favourable to the growth of the host trees. These factors, in conjunction with a lack of selection for resistance to emerging pathogens, lack of resilience to disease in monocultures, and the movement of pathogens with planting stock and seeds around the globe have led to substantial losses. Based on the Teratosphaeria leaf blight example, it is clear that more effective forest management and more stringent biosecurity measurements will be a required to sustain eucalypt plantations globally.

TI  - Evidence that fungal pathogens inhibit recruitment of a shade-intolerant tree, white birch (<i>Betula papyrifera</i>), in understory habitats
T2  - OECOLOGIA
AB  - Evidence from tropical forests suggests understory habitats are associated with a high risk of disease, which may prevent the establishment of vulnerable tree species; in contrast, canopy gaps can act as refuges from these pathogens. However, few studies have investigated the impacts of pathogens on regeneration in temperate forests. To determine whether losses to fungi of seeds of Betula papyrifera, a light-loving species, varied between habitats that differed in their degree of openness, we applied fungicide to seeds buried in old fields, treefall gaps, and forest understory sites. We found that the application of fungicide significantly reduced losses in all habitats, relative to control values. This effect was habitat-dependent: the benefit of fungicide was greater in forest understory than in openings. This suggests that B. papyrifera is prevented from establishing in understory environments in part by its susceptibility to pathogen attack, and not solely because of a high light requirement.

AB  - Advances in spatial and spectral resolution of sensors can be useless to detect directly understory and subcanopy species but make remote sensing of some ecosystems components increasingly feasible. We propose to use support vector machines (SVM) to integrate multisource-derived biophysical descriptors (overstory plant species, physiography and climate) for the indirect detection of the small invasive tree Miconia calvescens in tropical rainforests on the island of Tahiti (South Pacific). Our model consists in classifying overstory plant species from an optical Quickbird scene, with the output then used in a subsequent fusion process with digital elevation model (DEM) extracted physiographic and climatic descriptors. A range of accuracy metrics was calculated to assess the SVM-based model which widely outperforms the commonly used GARP model. Biophysical descriptors alone are necessary and sufficient to explain M. calvescens distribution and suggest that the potential invaded area is currently saturated in our study site on Tahiti. Rainfall, elevation and slope steepness are the major variables explaining the species distribution. In addition, our results show that morning insolation plays a critical role on M. calvescens height whether it is restricted to the subcanopy or reaches the forest surface. The model can be used to map the potential distribution of M. calvescens in areas where it has been recently introduced and rapidly spreading, such as in the Hawaiian islands, New Caledonia and Australia or in other French Polynesian islands. It also may be adapted to detect other species (plants or animals, alien invasives or rare endemics) in the understory and subcanopy of forest ecosystems. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Thirty-year bird population trends in an unfragmented temperate deciduous forest: Importance of habitat change
T2  - AUK
AB  - Abundances of forest birds in an unfragmented, undisturbed, and relatively mature temperate deciduous forest at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire, changed markedly between 1969 and 1998. Total numbers of birds (all species combined) declined from 210-220 individuals/10 ha in the early 1970s to 70-90/10 ha in the 1990s. Of the 24 regularly occurring species, 12 decreased significantly (four to local extinction), three increased significantly, and nine remained relatively constant in abundance. Nine of the 12 declining species were Neotropical migrants. Most species exhibited similar trends on Brooding Bird Survey (BBS) routes in New Hampshire during the same 30 year period and on three replicate study sites in nearby sections of the White Mountains from 1986-1998. Probable causes of trends were diverse and differed among species. Most could be accounted for by individual species' responses to events occurring primarily in the local breeding area. The most important local factor affecting bird abundance was temporal change in forest vegetation structure, resulting from natural forest succession and local disturbances. Four species that declined markedly and in some cases disappeared completely from the study plot (Least Flycatcher, Empidonax minimus; Wood Thrush, Hylocichla mustelina; Philadelphia Vireo, Vireo philadelphicus; and American Redstart, Setophaga ruticilla) appear to attain peak abundance in early or mid successional forests. Species preferring more mature forests, such as Black-throated Green Warbler (Dendroica virens) and Ovenbird (Seirus aurocapillus), increased significantly in abundance over the 30 year study. Other important factors influencing bird abundances were food availability and events in the migratory and winter periods. Nest-predation rates, although varying among years, showed no long-term pattern that would account for population declines, and brood parasites were absent from this forest. Findings from this study demonstrate that major changes in bird abundances occur over time even in undisturbed and relatively mature forests, and illustrate the need for considering habitat requirements of individual species and how habitat suitability changes over time when trying to assess the causes of their long-term population trends. The results also imply that any conclusions about the effects of other factors affecting forest bird abundances, such as increased nest predation or brood parasitism associated with habitat fragmentation, must also account for successional changes that may be affecting habitat suitability.

TI  - An agent-based model of the foraging ascomycete hypothesis
T2  - FUNGAL ECOLOGY
AB  - Most trees host hundreds of species of fungi asymptomatically in their internal tissues, known collectively as fungal endophytes. The Foraging Ascomycete (FA) hypothesis proposed that some fungal endophytes inhabit the internal leaf tissue of forest trees in order to enhance dispersal to substrates on the forest floor, by using leaves as vectors and as refugia during periods of environmental stress. This dispersal strategy has recently been termed viaphytism and is now thought to apply to fungal groups beyond ascomycetes. Viaphytism implies that many fungi may be in continuous and cyclical flux between life stages as endophytes in the forest canopy and as wood-decomposing fungi on the forest floor. This cycle may represent a very common and previously-ignored process in the ecology of forests, with implications for forest health. The ecological consequences of the viaphyte lifestyle are complex, so we constructed an agent-based model to explore it. Our model is intended to serve as both an explicit conceptual explanation of viaphytism, and as an exploration of the conditions in which a strategy of endophytism accompanied by leaf dispersal may be advantageous for fungi. In a scenario of a viaphytic fungal species on a model forest landscape, without fungal competitors, viaphytism is predicted to be a plausible alternative to dispersal to substrates by spores alone, allowing the fungus to persist reliably in the landscape. In a scenario that allows competition from aggressively dispersed non-viaphytic fungi, the model predicts some competitive benefits to fungal dispersal via leaves. However, these benefits are conditional, requiring sufficient retention through time of endophyte infections by host trees, and sufficient host trees in the landscape. In the model, loss of these fungal populations can result from increased local disturbances of forest canopy, and deforestation. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd and British Mycological Society.

TI  - An Acarologic Survey and <i>Amblyomma americanum</i> Distribution Map with Implications for Tularemia Risk in Missouri
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - In the United States, tickborne diseases occur focally. Missouri represents a major focus of several tickborne diseases that includes spotted fever rickettsiosis, tularemia, and ehrlichiosis. Our study sought to determine the potential risk of human exposure to human-biting vector ticks in this area. We collected ticks in 79 sites in southern Missouri during June 7-10, 2009, which yielded 1,047 adult and 3,585 nymphal Amblyomma americanum,5 adult Amblyomma maculatum, 19 adult Dermacentor variabilis, and 5 nymphal lxodes brunneus. Logistic regression analysis showed that areas posing an elevated risk of exposure to A. americanum nymphs or adults were more likely to be classified as forested than grassland, and the probability of being classified as elevated risk increased with increasing relative humidity during the month of June (30-year average). Overall accuracy of each of the two models was greater than 70% and showed that 20% and 30% of the state were classified as elevated risk for human exposure to nymphs and adults, respectively. We also found a significant positive association between heightened acarologic risk and counties reporting tularemia cases. Our study provides an updated distribution map for A. americanum in Missouri and suggests a wide-spread risk of human exposure to A. americanum and their associated pathogens in this region.

TI  - Shifts in the diversity of an amphibian community from a premontane forest of San Ramon, Costa Rica
T2  - REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL
AB  - Biological communities are experiencing rapid shifts of composition in Neotropical ecosystems due to several factors causing population declines. However, emerging evidence has provided insights on the adaptive potential of multiple species to respond to illnesses and environmental pressures. In Costa Rica, the decline of amphibian populations is a remarkable example of these changes. Here we provide evidence of variation in the amphibian richness of a premontane forest of San Ramon (Costa Rica) across a similar to 30 year period. We also quantified changes in the composition and abundance of the leaf-litter frog community occurring in the same premontane forest, by comparing diversity data with a difference of similar to 18 years. We evaluated the similarity of species richness from 1980s to 2010s based on several sources, and the dissimilarity of species diversity in the site comparing 28 standardized surveys from 1994-1995 and 2011-2012. We compared the relative abundance of some frogs that inhabit the leaf-litter layer between these same periods. Our results show that there is more similarity in amphibian richness between 1980s and 2010s (similar to 52 %) than between 1980s and 1990s (similar to 40 %). The richness of leaf-litter anurans was similar to 65 % similar between 1990s and 2010s. The diversity of leaf-litter anuran was clearly different between 1994-1995 and 2011-2012, and it was clustered among those periods. We determined that the amphibian community in this premontane forest drastically changed: many species have disappeared, or gradually declined through the decades (e.g. Pristimantis ridens, P. cruentus, Craugastor brans-fordii) as in other well studied localities of Costa Rica, while some few species flourished after being almost absent from the site in the 1990s (e.g. Craugastor crassidigitus, Lithobates warszewistchii). Currently dominant species such as C. crassidigitus would be using developed resistance against Bd-fungus as an advantage (apparent competition) in the premontane forest where the disease is more virulent than in lowlands. Our analysis supports the hypothesis of individualized responses of anuran populations under distinct site and elevations. We suggest to continue monitoring the amphibian communities of premontane tropical forests to understand how this ecosystem gradually resist and adapts to this catastrophic time of biodiversity loss.

TI  - Distribution and Host Selection of Tropical Rat Mite, <i>Ornithonyssus bacoti</i>, in Yunnan Province of Southwest China
T2  - ANIMALS
AB  - Simple Summary
   The tropical rat mite (Ornithonyssus bacoti) is a transmission vector of rickettsia pox and a potential vector of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). This article reports the distribution and host selection of O. bacoti in Yunnan Province of Southwest China. The original data came from the investigations in 39 counties of Yunnan. The prevalence (P-M), mean abundance (MA) and mean intensity (MI) were calculated to reflect the infestations of the dominant rat hosts with O. bacoti mites. The patchiness index and Taylor's power law were used to measure the spatial distribution of the mites. A total of 4121 O. bacoti mites were identified from 15 species of small mammal hosts in 27 of the 39 investigated counties, and 99.20% of them (4088/4121) were found on rodents. The majority of total O. bacoti mites was found in the flatland landscape (91.28%) and indoor habitat (73.48%). Moreover, 51.78% and 40.09% of O. bacoti mites were identified from Rattus tanezumi and R. norvegicus, the two synanthropic rat species. The mites had some host-specificity, with a preference to two dominant hosts (R. tanezumi and R. norvegicus), and they were of aggregated distribution on R. tanezumi.
   (1) Background: As a species of gamasid mite, the tropical rat mite (Ornithonyssus bacoti) is a common ectoparasite on rodents and some other small mammals. Besides stinging humans to cause dermatitis, O. bacoti can be a vector of rickettsia pox and a potential vector of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). (2) Objective: The present study was conducted to understand the host selection of O. bacoti on different animal hosts and the distribution in different environmental gradients in Yunnan Province of Southwest China. (3) Methods: The original data came from the investigations in 39 counties of Yunnan, between 1990 and 2015. The animal hosts, rodents and some other small mammals were mainly trapped with mouse traps. The O. bacoti mites on the body surface of animal hosts were collected and identified in a conventional way. The constituent ratio (Cr), prevalence (P-M), mean abundance (MA) and mean intensity (MI) were used to reflect infestations of animal hosts with O. bacoti mites. The patchiness index and Taylor's power law were used to measure the spatial distribution pattern of O. bacoti mites on their hosts. (4) Results: A total of 4121 tropical rat mites (O. bacoti) were identified from 15 species and 14,739 individuals of hosts, and 99.20% of them were found on rodents. More than half of O. bacoti mites (51.78%) were identified from the Asian house rat (Rattus tanezumi), and 40.09% of the mites from the Norway rat (R. norvegicus) (p < 0.05). The infestations of R. tanezumi (P-M = 7.61%, MA = 0.40 and MI = 5.31) and R. norvegicus (P-M = 10.98, MA = 1.14 and MI = 10.39) with O. bacoti mites were significantly higher than those of other host species (p < 0.05). The infestations of two dominant rat hosts (R. tanezumi and R. norvegicus) with O. bacoti mites varied in different environmental gradients (latitudes, longitudes, altitudes, landscapes and habitats) and on different sexes and ages of the hosts. The prevalence of juvenile R. norvegicus rats with O. bacoti mites (P-M = 12.90%) was significantly higher than that of adult rats (P-M = 9.62%) (p < 0.05). The prevalence (P-M = 38.46%) and mean abundance (MA = 2.28 mites/host) of R. tanezumi rats with O.
   bacoti mites in the high latitude were higher than those in the low latitudes (p < 0.05). The majority of the total collected 4121 O. bacoti mites was found in the flatland landscape (91.28%) and indoor habitat (73.48%) (p < 0.05). The P-M (10.66%) and MA (0.49 mites/host) of R. tanezumi rats with O. bacoti mites were significantly higher in the indoor habitat than in the outdoor habitat (p < 0.05). The tropical rat mites showed an aggregated distribution pattern on their first dominant host, R. tanezumi. Conclusion: The tropical rat mite (O. bacoti) is a widely distributed species of gamasid mite in Yunnan Province, Southwest China, and its dominant hosts are two synanthropic species of rats, R. tanezumi and R. norvegicus. It is mainly distributed in the flatland landscape and indoor habitat. It has some host-specificity, with a preference to rodents, especially R. tanezumi and R. norvegicus. The O. bacoti mites are of aggregated distribution on R. tanezumi rats.

T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
AB  - Many non-flying mammals help in the pollination of plant species in tropical forests. However, this remains poorly documented from India. Here we demonstrate with Cullenia exarillata, a canopy tree in the Western Ghats, how a wide range of visitors frequent flowers of the tree and how among them a few select mammals are important in pollination. Since Cullenia also uses bats as a pollinating vector, we further discuss how the dual strategy of using non-flying mammals and bats could have evolved in the wet forests of the Western Ghats.

TI  - COVID-Clarity demands unification of health and environmental policy
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - Spillover of novel pathogens from wildlife to people, such as the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, is increasing and this trend is most strongly associated with tropical deforestation driven by agricultural expansion. This same process is eroding natural capital, reducing forest-associated health co-benefits, and accelerating climate change. Protecting and promoting tropical forests is one of the most immediate steps we can take to simultaneously mitigate climate change while reducing the risk of future pandemics; however, success in this undertaking will require greater connectivity of policy initiatives from local to global, as well as unification of health and environmental policy.

TI  - Feral pigs in tropical lowland rainforest of northeastern Australia: ecology, zoonoses and management
T2  - WILDLIFE BIOLOGY
CP  - 3rd International Wild Boar Symposium
AB  - Feral pigs are well established in the lowland tropical forests of northeastern Queensland, Australia. Circumstantial evidence, e.g. the presence of a Melanesian tick, an exotic nematode and a dominant coat colour other than black, indicates that they do not originate from escaped domestic animals as feral pigs throughout other parts of Australia. It is likely that the ancestral population was established from animals originating from islands to the north and northwest of Australia, i.e. pigs domesticated from naturally occurring wild pigs in Indonesia and southeastern Asia. Pigs in lowland rainforests show relatively stable populations with a high reproductive potential in age classes 4-7. Seasonally there are negative interactions between residents and pigs. Pigs not only damage gardens and fruit orchards due to their rooting, they are also important vectors of zoonoses. Feral pigs are carriers of 11 Leptospirosis serovars, some of which are important zoonoses, e.g. L. australia, L. hardjo and L. zanoni. They also have a high burden of parasites. Lice Hematopinus suis and thorny headed worm Macracanthorhynchus hirudinaceous have been more frequently found in females than in males, whereas males seem to be more susceptible to ticks Ambylomma cyprium cyprium. The infection with lungworms Metastrongylus sp. is higher in younger pigs than older ones indicating that lungworms represent a major mortality factor of young pigs. In contrast, kidneyworm, Stephanurus dentatus and thorny headed worm is present at all ages. Leptospirosis, lung worm and kidneyworm are known causes of infertility and/or mortality in pigs and can be assumed to contribute to the lower than expected population density in this environment.

TI  - Phylogenetic signal in plant pathogen-host range
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
AB  - What determines which plant species are susceptible to a given plant pathogen is poorly understood. Experimental inoculations with fungal pathogens of plant leaves in a tropical rain forest show that most fungal pathogens are polyphagous but that most plant species in a local community are resistant to any given pathogen. The likelihood that a pathogen can infect two plant species decreases continuously with phylogenetic distance between the plants, even to ancient evolutionary distances. This phylogenetic signal in host range allows us to predict the likely host range of plant pathogens in a local community, providing an important tool for plant ecology, design of agronomic systems, quarantine regulations in international trade, and risk analysis of biological control agents. In particular, the results suggest that the rate of spread and ecological impacts of a disease through a natural plant community will depend strongly on the phylogenetic structure of the community itself and that current regulatory approaches strongly underestimate the local risks of global movement of plant pathogens or their hosts.

TI  - Profile of eye lesions and vision loss: a cross-sectional study in Lusambo, a forest-savanna area hyperendemic for onchocerciasis in the Democratic Republic of Congo
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE & INTERNATIONAL HEALTH
AB  - OBJECTIVE To determine baseline data regarding eye lesions and vision loss in five villages of Lusambo, an onchocerciasis-hyperendemic forest-savanna area in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), in preparation of mass ivermectin distribution.
   METHODS Five villages were selected by simple randomization. Through a cross-sectional design, 750 subjects were examined ophthalmologically. The eye examination included acuity visual measurement, slit-lamp examination, ophthalmoscopy, intraocular pressure measurement, and visual field assessment by the Wu-Jones test.
   RESULTS There was a high prevalence of onchocerciasis-related eye lesions compared with non-onchocercal lesions. Chorioretinitis (20%) was the most frequent disease, others were punctate keratitis and microfilariae in the anterior chamber in equal frequency (13.8%), white intraretinal deposits (10.4%) and iridocyclitis (8%). Vision loss was discovered in 8.5% of the subjects, of whom 0.5% had bilateral blindness, 2.2% had monocular blindness and 5.7% had visual impairment. Vision loss was mostly caused by onchocerciasis-related diseases, especially those affecting the anterior segment of the eye.
   CONCLUSION Features of ocular onchocerciasis usually described in forest and savanna areas were both found in this forest-savanna zone of the DRC.

TI  - Wound botulism acquired in the Amazonian rain forest of Ecuador
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
CP  - 50th Annual Meeting of the American-Society-of-Tropical-Medicine-and-Hygiene
AB  - Wound botulism results from colonization of a contaminated wound by Clostridium botulinum and the anaerobic in situ production of a potent neurotoxin. Between 1943, when wound botulism was first recognized, and 1990, 47 laboratory-confirmed cases, mostly trauma-associated, were reported in the United States. Since 1990, wound botulism associated with injection drug use emerged as the leading cause of wound botulism in the United States; 210 of 217 cases reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention between 1990 and 2002 were associated with drug injection. Despite the worldwide distribution of Clostridium botulinum spores, wound botulism has been reported only twice outside the United States, Europe, and Australia. However, wound botulism may go undiagnosed and untreated in many countries. We report two cases, both with type A toxin, from the Ecuadorian rain forest. Prompt clinical recognition, supportive care, and administration of trivalent equine botulinum antitoxin were life-saving.

T2  - TICKS AND TICK-BORNE DISEASES
AB  - Ornithodoros tabajara n. sp. is described from laboratory-reared larvae and adult specimens collected in the Brazilian Caatinga. This new species shares the ecological niche with Ornithodoros rietcorreai and is likely associated with colonial rodents of genus Kerodon. However, O. tabajara n. sp. is morphologically easy to distinguish from O. rietcorreai and other Neotropical Ornithodoros by a unique combination of characters: larva with 17 pairs of dorsal setae (seven anterolateral, three central and seven posterolateral), sub-oval dorsal plate, hypostome blunt apically with dentition formula 2/2 along its extension, only one pair of posthypostomal setae, six pairs of sternal setae, posteromedian setae absent, and leave-shaped anal valves; alive adults with whitish islands of mammillae symmetrically distributed on dorsum (not visible in ethanol-preserved specimens), and median disk merging with posteromedian file. A phylogenetic analysis performed with mitochondrial 16S rDNA sequences points O. tabajara n. sp. as O. rietcorreai's sister taxon, which rises the hypothesis of sympatric speciation.

Parasite presence has been confirmed in all Ecuadorian regions, but some ecosystems, such as the deciduous dry forest of the Coastal region, have not been evaluated for parasite presence. Data on presence or absence, and prevalence, of haemosporidian blood parasites were obtained from avian blood samples collected in two different dry deciduous forests in Guayaquil, Ecuador: Bosque Protector Prosperina and Area Nacional de Recreacion Parque Lago. Mist netting was performed between December 2018 and September 2019; blood smears were prepared from blood taken from 35 individuals of 20 bird species and all samples were analyzed by optical microscope observation. Most species showed no evidence of parasite infection, but haemosporidia were found on a blood smear obtained from a Black-capped Sparrow, Arremon abeillei (Passerelleidae), confirming this species as a newly discovered host of blood parasites.

TI  - Human Population Density Influences Genetic Diversity of Two <i>Rattus</i> Species Worldwide: A Macrogenetic Approach
T2  - GENES
AB  - On a planet experiencing constant human population growth, it is necessary to explore the anthropogenic effects on the genetic diversity of species, and specifically invasive species. Using an analysis that integrates comparative phylogeography, urban landscape genetics, macrogenetics and a systematic review, we explore the worldwide genetic diversity of the human commensal and anthropogenic species Rattus rattus and Rattus norvegicus. Based on metadata obtained considering 35 selected studies related to observed heterozygosity, measured by nuclear molecular markers (microsatellites, Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms-SNPs-, restrictition site-associated DNA sequencing -RAD-Seq-), socioeconomic and mobility anthropogenic factors were used as predictors of genetic diversity of R. rattus and R. norvegicus, using the Gini index, principal component analysis and Random Forest Regression as analysis methodology. Population density was on average the best predictor of genetic diversity in the Rattus species analyzed, indicating that the species respond in a particular way to the characteristics present in urban environments because of a combination of life history characteristics and human-mediated migration and colonization processes. To create better management and control strategies for these rodents and their associated diseases, it is necessary to fill the existing information gap in urban landscape genetics studies with more metadata repositories, with emphasis on tropical and subtropical regions of the world.

TI  - Erosion, sediment transport and reservoir sedimentation in the upper drainage basin of the Konto River, East Java, Indonesia
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NINTH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON RIVER SEDIMENTATION, VOLS 1-4
CP  - 9th International Symposium on River Sedimentation
AB  - This paper presents a diachronic hydrogeomorphological study of a hydrosystem in a tropical and volcanic area. The upper Konto River in East Java (Indonesia) has a medium size catchment (236 km(2)) dominated by active volcanoes, which provide high-profit arable soils although very sensitive to erosion. The population densities are then very high, in excess of 1000 per km(2). People thus play a key role in the evolution of the natural environment. The Konto hydrosystem as been disturbed during the last past decades by several factors: (1) A dam built in 1979 in the downstream of the study area; (2) a reforestation program (so-called Konto River Project) in the upper watershed in 1982, followed by (3) a deforestation period since 1998 following the economic and financial crisis in Indonesia (Reformasi). We have then analysed how this watershed reacted to anthropic disturbance, in studying the erosion sources, sediment transport, and sedimentation in the reservoir. The research on potential erosion zones in the watershed has been based on a GIS (ArcView(TM)) which combines thematic vector-based maps of the natural environment (slopes, climate, soil, etc.), and raster-based maps of the landuse, derived through Landsat(TM) images. A diachronic analysis of the suspended load as well as echosounding in the reservoir since the sixties helped us to assess soil erosion and resulting reservoir sedimentation. The erosion rates in Indonesia range among the highest in the world. Sedimentation rates within the Selorejo reservoir average 0.25 x 10(6) m(3.)yr(-1) during the afforestation period, but is six times larger (1.57 x 10(6) m(3.)yr(-1)) during deforestation period. Sediment rates in the Konto watershed are representative of other small watersheds strongly disturbed by human activities on Java and other tropical environment.

TI  - Landscape analysis of NTD diagnostics and considerations on the development of a strategy for regulatory pathways
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Access to quality-assured, accurate diagnostics is critical to ensure that the 2021-2030 neglected tropical disease (NTD) road map targets can be achieved. Currently, however, there is limited regulatory oversight and few quality assurance mechanisms for NTD diagnostic tools. In attempting to address such challenges and the changing environment in regulatory requirements for diagnostics, a landscape analysis was conducted, to better understand the availability of NTD diagnostics and inform future regulatory frameworks. The list of commercially available diagnostics was compiled from various sources, including WHO guidance, national guidelines for case detection and management, diagnostic target product profiles and the published literature. The inventory was analyzed according to diagnostic type, intended use, regulatory status, and risk classification. To estimate the global need and size of the market for each type of diagnostic, annual procurement data were collected from WHO, procurement agencies, NGOs and international organizations, where available and global disease prevalence. Expert interviews were also conducted to ensure a better understanding of how diagnostics are procured and used. Of 125 diagnostic tools included in this analysis, rapid diagnostic tools accounted for 33% of diagnostics used for NTDs and very few diagnostics had been subjected to regulatory assessment. The number of tests needed for each disease was less than 1 million units per annum, except in the case of two diseases, suggesting limited commercial value. Despite the nature of the market, and presumed insufficient return on commercial investment, acceptable levels of assurance on performance, quality and safety of diagnostics are still required. Priority actions include setting up an agile, interim, stepwise risk assessment mechanism, in particular for diagnostics of lower risk, in order to support national NTD programmes and their partners with the selection and procurement of the diagnostics needed to control, eliminate and eradicate NTDs.
   Author summary
   Rapidly evolving landscape of in-vitro diagnostics is posing quality assurance challenges for manufacturers and regulators as well as creating product selection dilemmas for procurers, donors, and national programmes. In attempting to address such challenges, a landscape analysis of Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTD) diagnostics was conducted to provide insights for all stakeholders to support a future regulatory framework for NTD diagnostics. The inventory of commercially available diagnostics was compiled and analyzed and the global need and size of the market for each type of diagnostic was estimated. The results showed low commercial value and limited regulatory oversight on NTD diagnostics. Despite the insufficient return on commercial investment, reasonable assurance of product safety, performance and quality is required. One of the priorities is to establish a risk assessment mechanism, in particular for NTD diagnostics of lower risk, in order to support national NTD programmes, procurement agencies, donors and other partners with the selection and procurement of the diagnostics needed to achieve the 2021-2030 NTD road map targets.

TI  - Consumption of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi by terrestrial and arboreal small mammals in a Panamanian cloud forest
T2  - JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY
AB  - Fecal pellets collected from 10 small-mammal species captured in a Panamanian cloud forest were examined for presence of spores of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Fifty-two percent of the 94 fecal samples examined contained spores of greater than or equal to 1 of 6 arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi species, including Sclerocytis coremioides, Glomus fasciculatum, G. rubiforme, G. geosporum, and 2 unidentified Glomus species. G. fasciculatum was the most frequently encountered species, occurring in 87% of the fecal samples that contained spores and occurring in diets of 7 small-mammal species occupying terrestrial and arboreal habitats. Peromyscus mexicanus and Oryzomys devius frequently consumed arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and may be important spore dispersers in terrestrial habitats. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal spores also were common in diets of the primarily arboreal rodent Reithronontomys mexicanus, suggesting a potentially important role of this species in the dispersal of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal spores to epiphytes of Neotropical cloud forests.

TI  - Agent-Based Modeling of Human-Induced Spread of Invasive Species in Agricultural Landscapes: Insights from the Potato Moth in Ecuador
T2  - JASSS-THE JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL SOCIETIES AND SOCIAL SIMULATION
AB  - Agent-based models (ABM) are ideal tools to deal with the complexity of pest invasion throughout agricultural socio-ecological systems, yet very few studies have applied them in such context. In this work we developed an ABM that simulates interactions between farmers and an invasive insect pest in an agricultural landscape of the tropical Andes. Our specific aims were to use the model 1) to assess the importance of farmers' mobility and pest control knowledge on pest expansion and 2) to use it as an educational tool to train farmer communities facing pest risks. Our model combined an ecological sub-model, simulating pest population dynamics driven by a cellular automaton including environmental factors of the landscape, with a social model in which we incorporated agents (farmers) potentially transporting and spreading the pest through displacements among villages. Results of model simulation revealed that both agents' movements and knowledge had a significant, non-linear, impact on invasion spread, confirming previous works on disease expansion by epidemiologists. However, heterogeneity in knowledge among agents had a low effect on invasion dynamics except at high levels of knowledge. Evaluations of the training sessions using ABM suggest that farmers would be able to better manage their crop after our implementation. Moreover, by providing farmers with evidence that pests propagated through their community not as the result of isolated decisions but rather as the result of repeated interactions between multiple individuals over time, our ABM allowed introducing them with social and psychological issues which are usually neglected in integrated pest management programs.

TI  - Anthropogenic impacts on Costa Rican bat parasitism are sex specific
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB  - While anthropogenic impacts on parasitism of wildlife are receiving growing attention, whether these impacts vary in a sex-specific manner remains little explored. Differences between the sexes in the effect of parasites, linked to anthropogenic activity, could lead to uneven sex ratios and higher population endangerment. We sampled 1108 individual bats in 18 different sites across an agricultural mosaic landscape in southern Costa Rica to investigate the relationships between anthropogenic impacts (deforestation and reductions in host species richness) and bat fly ectoparasitism of 35 species of Neotropical bats. Although female and male bat assemblages were similar across the deforestation gradient, bat fly assemblages tracked their hosts closely only on female bats. We found that in female hosts, parasite abundance per bat decreased with increasing bat species richness, while in male hosts, parasite abundance increased. We hypothesize the differences in the parasite-disturbance relationship are due to differences in roosting behavior between the sexes. We report a sex-specific parasite-disturbance relationship and argue that sex differences in anthropogenic impacts on wildlife parasitism could impact long-term population health and survival.

TI  - Complex population history of two <i>Anopheles dirus</i> mosquito species in Southeast Asia suggests the influence of Pleistocene climate change rather than human-mediated effects
T2  - JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY
AB  - Anopheles dirus and Anopheles baimaii are closely related species which feed on primates, particularly humans, and transmit malaria in the tropical forests of mainland Southeast Asia. Here, we report an in-depth phylogeographic picture based on 269 individuals from 21 populations from mainland Southeast Asia. Analysis of 1537 bp of mtDNA sequence revealed that the population history of A. baimaii is far more complex than previously thought. An old expansion (pre-300 kyr BP) was inferred in northern India/Bangladesh with a wave of south-eastwards expansion arriving at the Thai border (ca 135-173 kyr BP) followed by leptokurtic dispersal very recently (ca 16 kyr BP) into peninsular Thailand. The long and complex population history of these anthropophilic species suggests their expansions are not in response to the relatively recent (ca 40 kyr BP) human expansions in mainland Southeast Asia but, rather, fit well with our understanding of Pleistocene climatic change there.

TI  - Analyzing the Uncertainty of Estimating Forest Aboveground Biomass Using Optical Imagery and Spaceborne LiDAR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Accurate estimation of forest aboveground biomass (AGB) is important for carbon accounting. Forest AGB estimation has been conducted with a variety of data sources and prediction methods, but many uncertainties still exist. In this study, six prediction methods, including Gaussian processes, stepwise linear regression, nonlinear regression using a logistic model, partial least squares regression, random forest, and support vector machines were used to estimate forest AGB in Jiangxi Province, China, by combining Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) data, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, and field measurements. We compared the effect of three factors (prediction methods, sample sizes of field measurements, and cross-validation settings) on the predictive quality of the methods. The results showed that the prediction methods had the most considerable effect on the prediction quality. In most cases, random forest produced more accurate estimates than the other methods. The sample sizes had an obvious effect on accuracy, especially for the random forest model. The accuracy increased with increasing sample sizes. The random forest algorithm with a large number of field measurements, was the most precise (coefficient of determination (R-2) = 0.73, root mean square error (RMSE) = 23.58 Mg/ha). Increasing the number of folds within the cross-validation settings improved the R-2 values. However, no apparent change occurred in RMSE for different numbers of folds. Finally, the wall-to-wall forest AGB map over the study area was generated using the random forest model.

TI  - HIV and Schistosoma Co-Exposure Leads to Exacerbated Pulmonary Endothelial Remodeling and Dysfunction Associated with Altered Cytokine Landscape
T2  - CELLS
AB  - HIV and Schistosoma infections have been individually associated with pulmonary vascular disease. Co-infection with these pathogens is very common in tropical areas, with an estimate of six million people co-infected worldwide. However, the effects of HIV and Schistosoma co-exposure on the pulmonary vasculature and its impact on the development of pulmonary vascular disease are largely unknown. Here, we have approached these questions by using a non-infectious animal model based on lung embolization of Schistosoma mansoni eggs in HIV-1 transgenic (HIV) mice. Schistosome-exposed HIV mice but not wild-type (Wt) counterparts showed augmented pulmonary arterial pressure associated with markedly suppressed endothelial-dependent vasodilation, increased endothelial remodeling and vessel obliterations, formation of plexiform-like lesions and a higher degree of perivascular fibrosis. In contrast, medial wall muscularization was similarly increased in both types of mice. Moreover, HIV mice displayed an impaired immune response to parasite eggs in the lung, as suggested by decreased pulmonary leukocyte infiltration, small-sized granulomas, and augmented residual egg burden. Notably, vascular changes in co-exposed mice were associated with increased expression of proinflammatory and profibrotic cytokines, including IFN-gamma and IL-17A in CD4(+) and gamma delta T cells and IL-13 in myeloid cells. Collectively, our study shows for the first time that combined pulmonary persistence of HIV proteins and Schistosoma eggs, as it may occur in co-infected people, alters the cytokine landscape and targets the vascular endothelium for aggravated pulmonary vascular pathology. Furthermore, it provides an experimental model for the understanding of pulmonary vascular disease associated with HIV and Schistosoma co-morbidity.

TI  - Tropical soil order and suborder prediction combining optical and X-ray approaches
T2  - GEODERMA REGIONAL
AB  - Proper soil taxonomic classification makes a significant contribution toward sustainable soil management, decision making, and soil conservation. For that, a quick, environmentally-friendly, non-invasive, cost-effective and reliable method for soil class assessment is desirable. As such, this study used NixPro color and portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) data to characterize seven different soil orders in Brazilian tropical soils, exploring the ability of three machine learning algorithms [Support Vector Machine with Linear Kernel (SVMLK), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Random Forest (RF)] with and without Principal Component Analysis (PCA) pretreatment for prediction of different soils at the order and suborder taxonomic levels under both dry and moist conditions. In total, 734 soil samples were collected from surface and subsurface horizons encompassing twelve suborders. The soil profiles were morphologically described and taxonomy classified per the Brazilian Soil Classification System and the approximate correspondence was made with the US Soil Taxonomy. Soil samples were separated into modeling (70%) and validation (30%) sub-datasets, overall accuracy and Cohen's Kappa coefficient evaluated model quality. Models generated from B horizon sample with pXRF and NixPro (moist samples) data combined delivered the best accuracy for order (81.19% overall accuracy and 0.71 Kappa index) and suborder predictions (74.35% overall accuracy and 0.65 Kappa index) through RF algorithm without PCA pretreatment. Summarily, the use of these two portable sensor systems was shown effective at accurately predicting different soil orders and suborders in tropical soils. Future works should extend the results of this study to temperate regions to corroborate the conclusions presented herein. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Toward New Epidemiological Landscapes of <i>Trypanosoma cruzi</i> (Kinetoplastida, Trypanosomatidae) Transmission under Future Human-Modified Land Cover and Climatic Change in Mexico
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE
AB  - Chagas disease, caused by the protozoa Trypanosoma cruzi, is an important yet neglected disease that represents a severe public health problem in the Americas. Although the alteration of natural habitats and climate change can favor the establishment of new transmission cycles for T. cruzi, the compound effect of human-modified landscapes and current climate change on the transmission dynamics of T. cruzi has until now received little attention. A better understanding of the relationship between these factors and T. cruzi presence is an important step towards finding ways to mitigate the future impact of this disease on human communities. Here, we assess how wild and domestic cycles of T. cruzi transmission are related to human-modified landscapes and climate conditions (LUCC-CC). Using a Bayesian datamining framework, we measured the correlations among the presence of T. cruzi transmission cycles (sylvatic, rural, and urban) and historical land use, land cover, and climate for the period 1985 to 2012. We then estimated the potential range changes of T. cruzi transmission cycles under future land-use and -cover change and climate change scenarios for 2050 and 2070 time-horizons, with respect to "green" (RCP 2.6), "business-as-usual" (RCP 4.5), and "worst-case" (RCP 8.5) scenarios, and four general circulation models. Our results show how sylvatic and domestic transmission cycles could have historically interacted through the potential exchange of wild triatomines (insect vectors of T. cruzi) and mammals carrying T. cruzi, due to the proximity of human settlements (urban and rural) to natural habitats. However, T. cruzi transmission cycles in recent times (i.e., 2011) have undergone a domiciliation process where several triatomines have colonized and adapted to human dwellings and domestic species (e.g., dogs and cats) that can be the main blood sources for these triatomines. Accordingly, Chagas disease could become an emerging health problem in urban areas. Projecting potential future range shifts of T. cruzi transmission cycles under LUCC-CC scenarios we found for RCP 2.6 no expansion of favourable conditions for the presence of T. cruzi transmission cycles. However, for RCP 4.5 and 8.5, a significant range expansion of T. cruzi could be expected. We conclude that if sustainable goals are reached by appropriate changes in socio-economic and development policies we can expect no increase in suitable habitats for T. cruzi transmission cycles.

TI  - Malaria vectors and urbanization in the equatorial forest region of south Cameroon
T2  - TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Entomological surveys were carried out in the town of Mbalmayo and in the nearby rural village of Olama, within the equatorial forest zone of Cameroon. Mosquitoes were captured when landing on human volunteers and by pyrethrum spray catches. Malaria vectors captured were Anopheles gambiae Giles (M and S forms) and A. moucheti Evans in both areas, together with A. funestus Giles in Mbalmayo. One A. marshallii (Theobald) specimen infected by Plasmodium falciparum was found in Olama. Anopheles moucheti was the most abundant anopheline species caught in Olama, while A. gambiae was the most abundant in Mbalmayo. All these vectors were highly anthropophilic as indicated by the fact that only 5 of 201 blood meats analysed had been taken from non-human hosts. Plasmodium falciparum was the only malaria parasite species found in Mbalmayo, white P malariae was also found in Olama. The annual entomological inoculation rate was estimated at 129 infective bites/person/year in Mbalmayo and 322 in Olama. Comparison with data published in 1955 from Mbalmayo, before expansion of the town, showed the impact of urbanization on the composition of the vector system and malaria transmission dynamics. Such changes should be considered when implementing sustainable control measures. (c) 2004 Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Fungal endophytes in Mediterranean oak forests:: A lesson from <i>Discula quercina</i>
T2  - PHYTOPATHOLOGY
AB  - Fungal endophytes that colonize forest trees are widespread, but they are less well known than endophytes infecting grasses. The few studies on endophytes in trees mainly concern the tropical areas and the northernmost latitudes, while similar investigations in the Mediterranean region have so far been scarce and incidental. Endophytes are studied mostly in economically important forests suffering from diseases, such as oak forests. One common endophyte that has received some study on oak is the mitosporic Discula quercina. This paper, after first addressing some basic problems on tree endophytes, examines the ecology of D. quercina in Mediterranean oak stands. D. quercina is usually viewed as a symptomless colonizer of healthy Quercus cerris. infecting new leaves early in the growing season, in an unstable equilibrium between transient mutualism/neutralism and latent pathogenesis. It is postulated here that climatic factors can change the endophytic nature of D. quercina, turning it into a weak pathogen or an opportunistic invader of senescing and indeed healthy trees. It is argued more generally that stochastic events can cause the lifestyle of an endophyte to switch from beneficial/neutral to pathogenic, transforming the tree-endophyte interaction, an interaction that depends in part on the matching genomes of the tree and endophyte, and on the environmental context.

TI  - Long-term monitoring of tropical bats for anthropogenic impact assessment: Gauging the statistical power to detect population change
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Bats are ecologically important mammals in tropical ecosystems; however, their populations face numerous environmental threats related to climate change, habitat loss, fragmentation, hunting, and emerging diseases. Thus, there is a pressing need to develop and implement large-scale networks to monitor trends in bat populations over extended time periods. Using data from a range of Neotropical and Paleotropical bat assemblages, we assessed the ability for long-term monitoring programs to reliably detect temporal trends in species abundance. We explored the magnitude of within-site temporal variation in abundance and evaluated the statistical power of a suite of different sampling designs for several different bat species and ensembles. Despite pronounced temporal variation in abundance of most tropical bat species, power simulations suggest that long-term monitoring programs (>= 20 years) can detect population trends of 5% per year or more with adequate statistical power (>= 0.9). However, shorter monitoring programs (<= 10 years) have insufficient power for trend detection. Overall, our analyses demonstrate that a monitoring program extending over 20 years with four surveys conducted biennially on five plots per monitoring site would have the potential for detecting a 5% annual change in abundance for a suite of bat species from different ensembles. The likelihood of reaching adequate statistical power was sensitive to initial species abundance and the magnitude of count variation, stressing that only the most abundant species in an assemblage and those with generally low variation in abundance should be considered for detailed population monitoring.

TI  - The evolving agricultural landscape of post-plantation Hawai'i
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
AB  - Hawai'i's agricultural landscape was previously dominated by large monocrop plantations of sugar cane and pineapple, but following a sweeping series of plantation closures beginning at the end of the twentieth century, that era has concluded. The last spatial assessment of Hawai'i's agricultural footprint was completed in 1980, during the active plantation period. Here we present the results of a 2015 statewide assessment of the commercial crop footprint for Hawai'i, based on World-View 2 satellite imagery and supporting datasets. We analyzed changes relative to the 1980 baseline on both a statewide and regional basis, to better understand how Hawai'i's agricultural system has evolved in the post plantation era. Sugar cane and pineapple saw dramatic reductions during this period, collectively losing more acres (257,000) than were planted for all crops combined (152,000) in 2015. Idle plantation lands and past plantation-era investments in irrigation and other infrastructure have created opportunities for other types of agriculture, despite rising land values, new and existing tropical diseases, and other challenges. Seed crops, primarily for genetically modified corn trials, were the second largest crop in 2015 (24,000 acres) despite having no mapped footprint in 1980. Commercial forestry, also absent in 1980, covered 23,000 acres in 2015. Macadamia nut, coffee, and diversified agriculture also all saw significant gains in their footprints, with coffee plantings increasing >250% during this period. Despite these gains, the Hawaiian Islands continue to have an extremely low degree of self-reliance for food production. The Oahu plain, adjacent to the major population center of Honolulu, has the most potential for considerably increasing the production of local produce, but without changes in consumption patterns and significant efforts to protect agricultural land from development, any increases in local food production will continue to be incremental. The post-plantation agricultural landscape in Hawaii is smaller, more diversified, and more nimble than it was in 1980, reflecting inter-island geographic differences in land use, history, and ownership. Mapping and assessing, spatial changes in agricultural activity over time can provide valuable insights for decision-makers and communities as they continue to define what agriculture should look like in the post-plantation era. Our results suggest that Hawai'i's agricultural landscape and overall production capability will continue to contract without substantial changes in policy and practice. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Effects of collared peccary (<i>Pecan tajacu</i>) exclusion on leaf litter amphibians and reptiles in a Neotropical wet forest, Costa Rica
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Peccaries are known to shape vegetation structure and create important breeding habitat for some pond-breeding amphibians in Neotropical forests. Because peccaries are also important agents of disturbance and microhabitat variation in the litter, peccary loss could have important consequences for litter amphibians and reptiles that depend entirely upon the litter for shelter, foraging and reproduction sites, and thermoregulation. However, very little is known about the effects of peccaries or their loss on litter amphibians and reptiles. We experimentally reduced peccary density in 20 x 50 m fenced exclusion plots (n = 5). We compared standing litter structure and amphibian and reptile abundance where peccaries were excluded to paired, open-forest control plots that had natural peccary densities. We encountered 16% more amphibian and reptile individuals in open control plots, and we encountered more juveniles of the most common anuran species in control plots than on peccary exclusions. Control plots had more compacted litter than peccary exclusion plots, indicating that peccaries alter the physical structure of the standing leaf litter in a way that promotes greater recruitment of juvenile anurans. Our results demonstrate that peccaries should be viewed not just as seed predators or ecosystem engineers for palms and pond-breeding amphibians, but also as important agents that affect leaf litter structure and abundance of terrestrial amphibians and reptiles. Peccary extirpation from overhunting or habitat degradation could have unexpected negative consequences for litter amphibians and reptiles, a diverse group already severely threatened by habitat loss, climate change, disease, and other anthropogenic effects worldwide.

TI  - Soil subgroup prediction via portable X-ray fluorescence and visible near-infrared spectoscopy
T2  - GEODERMA
AB  - Recently, portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) spectrometer and visible near-infrared (Vis-NIR) spectroscopy are increasingly being applied for soil types and attributes prediction, but a few works have used them combined in tropical regions. Thus, this work aimed at analyzing models performance when predicting soil types at subgroup taxonomic level via pXRF and Vis-NIR separately and together. 315 soil samples were collected in both A and B horizons in three important Brazilian states. Samples undergone laboratorial analyses for soil classification and were submitted to pXRF and Vis-NIR (3502500 nm) analyses. Vis-NIR spectral data preprocessing was evaluated utilizing Savitzky-Golay (WT) and Savitzky-Golay with Binning (WB) methods. Four classification algorithms were employed in modeling: Support Vector Machine with Linear (SVM-L) and Radial (SVM-R) kernel, C5.0, and Random Forest (RF). Predictions were made using only B horizon and using A + B horizon data. Overall accuracy and Cohens Kappa index evaluated model quality. Both sensors displayed efficacy in soil types prediction. A + B horizons data combined using pXRF + Vis-NIR via SVM-R (WT and WB) delivered accurate predictions (89.32% overall accuracy and 0.75 Kappa index), but the best predictions were achieved using only B horizon data via pXRF with RF, pXRF + Vis-NIR (WT) with RF, pXRF + Vis-NIR (WB) with C5.0, and pXRF + Vis-NIR (WB) with RF (89.23% overall accuracy and 0.80 Kappa index). For tropical soils, soil subgroup prediction using only B horizon data obtained by pXRF in tandem with RF algorithm may be a viable alternative to assist in soil classification, especially when the acquisition of Vis-NIR is not possible.

TI  - Diversity of Hemiptera Auchenorrhyncha in Citrus, Coffee and a Fragment of Native Forest of the State of Sao Paulo
T2  - NEOTROPICAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - The population of Hemiptera Auchenorrhyncha was studied in sweet citrus groves (Citrus sinensis), coffee plantations (Coffea arabica) and a semi-deciduous seasonal forest with shrub physiognomy in Bebedouro, SP, to evaluate the influence of the natural ecosystem on the species composition of the agroecosystems. Monitoring was carried out by using yellow stick cards, which were replaced every 15 days and all Auchenorrhyncha collected were counted and identified. Seven families, 11 subfamilies and 98 species were collected, with Cicadellidae being the most abundant. The native forest presented larger wealth, diversity and equitability of Auchenorrhyncha species, demonstrating to be more stable than the other habitats. The high values of similarities obtained between the agroecosystems and the forest demonstrated that great part of Auchenorrhyncha species occurring in the agricultural habitats was also occurring at the forest, indicating that the last may serve as reservoir of species. The abundance of the taxonomic groups of Auchenorrhyncha collected varied with the evaluated habitats, with Proconiini being the most abundant in the coffee plantation next to the forest, Athysanini, Scaphytopiini, Neocoelidiinae and Coelidiinae in the orange orchard and coffee plantation distant from the forest; Cicadellinae and Agalliinae were not related to any of the habitats. The presence of vector insects and possible vectors of plant diseases in the appraised habitats indicate the need of the implementation of strategies for landscape management.

TI  - Records of the bush dog <i>Speothos venaticus</i> in a continuous remnant of coastal Atlantic Forest in southern Brazil
T2  - ORYX
AB  - The bush dog Speothos venaticus, a rarely seen Neotropical canid categorized as Near Threatened globally, is categorized as Vulnerable in Brazil. In the Atlantic Forest occurrence data of this species are extremely rare. Here we document new records of the bush dog in four reserves in a large remnant of continuous coastal Atlantic Forest in Parana state, southern Brazil. From a total of 4,112 trap days in two camera-trap surveys in 2009 and 2011 we obtained one opportunistic sighting and three independent photographic records of the bush dog. Additionally, park guards reported previous sightings (> 4 years earlier) in three of these reserves, including the reserve where we did not record the species. Our results indicate that the remnant coastal Atlantic Forest of Parana state is an important region for the conservation of the bush dog in southern Brazil. Given the rarity of this species in its natural habitat we suggest that conservation efforts in this region should focus on minimizing the potential threats (prey depletion from poaching and disease transmission from domestic dog) to the species.

TI  - Post-translational Modification of LipL32 during <i>Leptospira interrogans</i> Infection
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background: Leptospirosis, a re-emerging disease of global importance caused by pathogenic Leptospira spp., is considered the world's most widespread zoonotic disease. Rats serve as asymptomatic carriers of pathogenic Leptospira and are critical for disease spread. In such reservoir hosts, leptospires colonize the kidney, are shed in the urine, persist in fresh water and gain access to a new mammalian host through breaches in the skin.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Previous studies have provided evidence for post-translational modification (PTM) of leptospiral proteins. In the current study, we used proteomic analyses to determine the presence of PTMs on the highly abundant leptospiral protein, LipL32, from rat urine-isolated L. interrogans serovar Copenhageni compared to in vitro-grown organisms. We observed either acetylation or tri-methylation of lysine residues within multiple LipL32 peptides, including peptides corresponding to regions of LipL32 previously identified as epitopes. Intriguingly, the PTMs were unique to the LipL32 peptides originating from in vivo relative to in vitro grown leptospires. The identity of each modified lysine residue was confirmed by fragmentation pattern analysis of the peptide mass spectra. A synthetic peptide containing an identified tri-methylated lysine, which corresponds to a previously identified LipL32 epitope, demonstrated significantly reduced immunoreactivity with serum collected from leptospirosis patients compared to the peptide version lacking the tri-methylation. Further, a subset of the identified PTMs are in close proximity to the established calcium-binding and putative collagen-binding sites that have been identified within LipL32.
   Conclusions/Significance: The exclusive detection of PTMs on lysine residues within LipL32 from in vivo-isolated L. interrogans implies that infection-generated modification of leptospiral proteins may have a biologically relevant function during the course of infection. Although definitive determination of the role of these PTMs must await further investigations, the reduced immune recognition of a modified LipL32 epitope suggests the intriguing possibility that LipL32 modification represents a novel mechanism of immune evasion within Leptospira.

TI  - Lack of adequate taxonomic knowledge may hinder endemic mammal conservation in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - The Atlantic Forest is one of the most diverse and threatened ecosystems of the world, being thus classified as one of the most important biodiversity hotspots. However, habitat loss, overexploitation, alien species, disease and pollution are not the only threats faced by native fauna and. ora. The lack of adequate taxonomic knowledge hinders conservation and management efforts of endemic species. This is true even for mammals, which is the most charismatic group of animals and traditionally receive a good deal of attention from scientists and the public in general. A few examples show how this gap in local fauna information can be demise for species conservation, even misguiding management strategies: molecular data reveal a hidden marsupial diversity; the lack of taxonomic studies at the species level seriously threatens rodent conservation; and the taxonomic rearrangement of the genus Brachyteles revealed a new species and had a great impact on management strategies. New species are discovered, described and taxonomically rearranged at an astounding rate. We can only be successful in biodiversity conservation if we have at least a minimum level of knowledge about what we are trying to preserve. That is true both for researchers and for the general public. Recent taxonomic revisions may represent the turning point in Neotropical fauna knowledge, which, coupled with a greater awareness of local people about the rich biodiversity that dot their backyards, can represent a better conservation prospect for the endemics of the Atlantic Forest.

TI  - The population of the Amazon basin in 1492: A view from the Ecuadorian headwaters
T2  - TRANSACTIONS OF THE INSTITUTE OF BRITISH GEOGRAPHERS
AB  - Recent archaeological, ethnohistorical and ecological evidence has begun to challenge the view that 'civilizations' failed to develop in the Amazon basin due to limitations of the tropical forest environment. As a result, estimates of the native population in 1492 have become an issue of debate. These estimates are evaluated in the light of ethnohistorical research on the Ecuadorian headwaters. Estimates are considered by examining estimated habitat densities, the impact of Old World diseases and contemporary evidence for native cultures. The study is based on documents found in archives in Quite, Seville, Madrid and Rome. It is suggested that the population of the Amazon basin in 1492 probably exceeded 5 million but that expectations of substantially higher populations appear unfounded.

TI  - Wealth and Education Influences on Spatial Pattern of Tree Planting in a Tropical Metropolis in Brazil
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - Green infrastructure, and specifically urban afforestation, is one of the most important activities of city management today, because of the multitude of ecosystem services it provides. The pattern of tree planting in urban areas is related to age, ethnicity, education, and household income. Unfortunately, this issue has not been evaluated, nor has it received significant subsidized governmental actions, funding, study, or public policies in large tropical cities in developing countries. Thus, we aimed to investigate if there was a pattern of urban afforestation related by socio-territorial inequalities, in the city of Sao Paulo, or if there was a relationship between the number of seedlings planted over the past 4 years and zoning, socioeconomic, health, and environment variables in the neighborhoods of Sao Paulo, as well as to evaluate the ecosystem services provided by the planted species. Our results showed that tree planting was not oriented to increase cover of less-vegetated areas of the city and where more respiratory diseases have been registered. In fact, the number of seedlings planted over the past 4 years was very influenced by socioeconomic status of inhabitants. In this sense, wealth and education proved to be a better predictor than zoning, health, and environmental variables for the tree planting. Finally, our results reveal that supporting, provision, and cultural functions and services are being provided to Sao Paulo city by the selected woody species. In Sao Paulo, urban afforestation must extend to the neighborhoods that need the services the most.

TI  - THE BREEDING SYSTEM AND POLLINATORS OF MELASTOMA-AFFINE (MELASTOMATACEAE) - A PIONEER SHRUB IN TROPICAL AUSTRALIA
T2  - BIOTROPICA
AB  - Melastoma affine D. Don. (Melastomataceae) is a pioneer species of rain forest and wet-sclerophyll habitats in the Australasian region. The breeding system and pollen vectors of Melastoma affine in the Mt. Spec region, North Queensland, were investigated over two seasons. Melastoma affine is self-compatible but does not produce fruit via autogamy or apomixis, i.e., pollen vectors are required for fruit set. The colonizing success of this species is thus dependent on the presence of a pollinator population. Eight bee species were commonly recorded at the nectar-less flowers of M. affine; although only Lestis bombylans, Nomia sp., Amegilla anomola, and Xylocopa near gressitti consistently contacted the stigma during foraging. When sunny weather prevails natural fruit set in M. affine reaches 90 percent, reflecting high visitation and subsequent pollination by such pollinators. The dimorphic stamens of M. affine both contain viable pollen which has to be extracted from an apical pore. Two modes of pollen extraction were common: buzz pollen collection, where pollen is vibrated from anthers; and, anther destruction, where pollen is removed from holes made by bees. Pollen collectors that buzz anthers spend less time at flowers than bees that extract pollen by other means. Furthermore, bees that gather pollen via destructive means rarely touch melastome stigmas.

TI  - Neotropical wild rodents <i>Akodon</i> and <i>Oligoryzomys</i> (Cricetidae: Sigmodontinae) as important carriers of pathogenic renal <i>Leptospira</i> in the Atlantic forest, in Brazil
T2  - RESEARCH IN VETERINARY SCIENCE
AB  - Leptospirosis is an important worldwide zoonosis, caused by a bacterium of the genus Leptospira. For a better understanding of the disease, it is relevant the application of the one health concept. The Atlantic Forest is considered a biodiversity hotspot, with a great endemism of species and despite its importance and proximity to urban areas, the potential role of its fauna as carriers of infectious agents is still poorly understood. Although it is well-known that rats and mice are key reservoirs of leptospires, particularly Rattus norvegicus, wild rodents have also been revealed as reservoirs of leptospiral strains. Thus, the purpose of this study was to investigate the role of the sigmodontine rodents from genera Akodon and Oligoryzomys as pathogenic Leptospira carriers in the Atlantic Forest. We studied 52 Akodon spp. and 15 Oligoryzomys spp. from three areas. Overall 30% were PCR-positive for pathogenic Leptospira, 27% (14/52) Akodon spp. and 40% (6/15) Oligoryzomys spp. DNA sequencing of LipL32 gene confirmed nine species as pathogenic Leptospira. This remarkable incidence of leptospiral carriage within wild genera emphasizes the role of these rodents as carriers of leptospires throughout in this environment.

TI  - Possible Factors Influencing the Seroprevalence of Dengue among Residents of the Forest Fringe Areas of Peninsular Malaysia
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE
AB  - Dengue is an endemic mosquito-borne viral disease prevalent in many urban areas of the tropic, especially the Southeast Asia. Its presence among the indigenous population of Peninsular Malaysia (Orang Asli), however, has not been well described. The present study was performed to investigate the seroprevalence of dengue among the Orang Asli (OA) residing at the forest fringe areas of Peninsular Malaysia and determine the factors that could affect the transmission of dengue among the OA. Eight OA communities consisting of 491 individuals were recruited. From the study, at least 17% of the recruited study participants were positive for dengue IgG, indicating past exposure to dengue. Analysis on the demographic and socioeconomic variables suggested that high seroprevalence of dengue was significantly associated with those above 13 years old and a low household income of less than MYR500 (USD150). It was also associated with the vast presence of residential areas and the presence of a lake. Remote sensing analysis showed that higher land surface temperatures and lower land elevations also contributed to higher dengue seroprevalence. The present study suggested that both demographic and geographical factors contributed to the increasing risk of contracting dengue among the OA living at the forest fringe areas of Peninsular Malaysia. The OA, hence, remained vulnerable to dengue.

TI  - Analysis of different polarimetric target decomposition methods in forest density classification using C band SAR data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
AB  - The ability of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) C-band microwave energy to penetrate within forest vegetation makes it possible to extract information on crown components, which in turn gives a better approximation of relative canopy density than optical data-derived canopy density. Many studies have been reported to estimate forest biomass from SAR data, but the scope of C-band SAR in characterizing forest canopy density has not been adequately understood with polarimetric techniques. Polarimetric classification is one of the most significant applications of polarimetric SAR in remote sensing. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the feasibility of different polarimetric SAR data decomposition methods in forest canopy density classification using C-band SAR data. Landsat (Land Satellite) 5 TM (Thematic Mapper) data of the same area has been used as optical data to compare the classification result. RADARSAT (Radar Satellite)-2 image with fine quad-pol obtained on 27 October 2011 over tropical dry forests of Madhav National Park, India, was used for the analysis of full polarimetric data. Six decomposition methods were selected based on incoherent decomposition for generating input images for classification, i.e. Huynen, Freeman and Durden, Yamaguchi, Cloude, Van zyl, and H/A/. The performance of each decomposition output in relation to each land cover unit present in the study area was assessed using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Results show that Yamaguchi 4-component decomposition (overall accuracy 87.66% and kappa coefficient () 0.86) gives better classification results, followed by Van Zyl decomposition (overall accuracy 87.20% and 0.85) and Freeman and Durden (overall accuracy 86.79% and 0.85) in forest canopy density classification. Both model-based decompositions (Freeman and Durden and Yamaguchi4) registered good classification accuracy. In eigenvector or eigenvalue decompositions, Van zyl registered the second highest accuracy among different decompositions. The experimental results obtained with polarimetric C-band SAR data over a tropical dry deciduous forest area imply that SAR data have significant potential for estimating canopy density in operational forestry. A better forest density classification result can be achieved within the forest mask (without other land cover classes). The limitations associated with optical data such as non-availability of cloud-free data and misclassification because of gregarious occurrence of bushy vegetation such as Lantana can be overcome by using C-band SAR data.

TI  - Molecular Ecological Insights into Neotropical Bird-Tick Interactions
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - In the tropics, ticks parasitize many classes of vertebrate hosts. However, because many tropical tick species are only identifiable in the adult stage, and these adults usually parasitize mammals, most attention on the ecology of tick-host interactions has focused on mammalian hosts. In contrast, immature Neotropical ticks are often found on wild birds, yet difficulties in identifying immatures hinder studies of birds' role in tropical tick ecology and tick-borne disease transmission. In Panama, we found immature ticks on 227 out of 3,498 individually-sampled birds representing 93 host species (24% of the bird species sampled, and 13% of the Panamanian land bird fauna). Tick parasitism rates did not vary with rainfall or temperature, but did vary significantly with several host ecological traits. Likewise, Neotropical-Nearctic migratory birds were significantly less likely to be infested than resident species. Using a molecular library developed from morphologically-identified adult ticks specifically for this study, we identified eleven tick species parasitizing birds, indicating that a substantial portion of the Panamanian avian species pool is parasitized by a diversity of tick species. Tick species that most commonly parasitized birds had the widest diversity of avian hosts, suggesting that immature tick species are opportunistic bird parasites. Although certain avian ecological traits are positively associated with parasitism, we found no evidence that individual tick species show specificity to particular avian host ecological traits. Finally, our data suggest that the four principal vectors of Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever in the Neotropics rarely, if ever, parasitize Panamanian birds. However, other tick species that harbor newly-discovered rickettsial parasites of unknown pathogenicity are frequently found on these birds. Given our discovery of broad interaction between Panamanian tick and avian biodiversity, future work on tick ecology and the dynamics of emerging tropical tick-borne pathogens should explicitly consider wild bird as hosts.

TI  - Occurrence of <i>Prosthenorchis elegans</i> in Free-living Primates from the Atlantic Forest of Southern Bahia, Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE DISEASES
AB  - Parasite prevalence and abundance are important factors affecting species' conservation. During necropsies on a free-living golden-headed lion tamarin (Leontopithecus chrysomelas) and two Wied's marmosets (Callithrix kuhlii) in the Atlantic Forest of southern Bahia, Brazil, we collected a large number of adult intestinal parasites that we identified as Prosthenorchis elegans. This parasite is pathogenic for neotropical primates. Prosthenorchis spp. infestation is influenced by diet with increased risk of exposure from ingesting invertebrate intermediate hosts. The biological similarities and sympatric nature of these two nonhuman primates support that they may harbor similar infectious and parasitic agents.

TI  - PATHOGENICITY OF <i>RIGIDOPORUS MICROPORUS</i> AND <i>PHELLINUS NOXIUS AGAINST</i> FOUR MAJOR PLANTATION TREE SPECIES IN PENINSULAR MALAYSIA
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL FOREST SCIENCE
AB  - MOHD FARID A, LEE SS, MAZIAH Z & PATAHAYAH M. 2009. Pathogenicity of Rigidoporus microporus and Phellinus noxius against four major plantation tree species in Peninsular Malaysia. Rigidoporus microporus and Phellinus noxius are destructive fungi in tropical forest plantations. Early stages of infection by these pathogens are often difficult to detect while trees bearing visible disease symptoms are mostly beyond treatment. Little research has been conducted to determine the aggressiveness of these two pathogens on different tree species. This study was conducted on 24-month-old saplings of Acacia mangium, Azadirachta excelsa, Tectona grandis and Hevea brasilienuis. Inoculum blocks of R microporus and P. noxius were placed next to roots of saplings and left for 30 weeks for infection to take place. The study revealed that R microporus and P. noxius were pathogenic to all hosts. However, the degree of pathogenicity-varied. Phellinus noxius was more pathogenic to H. brasiliensis than to A. excelsa, T grandis and A. mangium, while R microporus was more pathogenic to H. brasiliensis and A. excelsa than to A. mangium and 7: grandis. In terms of host susceptibility, H. brasiliensis was the most susceptible to It microporus followed by A. excelsa, 7: grandis and A. mangium. Against P noxius, T. grandis was the most susceptible, followed by H. brasiliensis, A. excelsa and A. mangium. Saplings infected by both pathogens manifested similar above ground symptoms, but symptoms belowground varied depending on the fungal species. The presence of adhering soil particles and dark brown mycelial crust on the root was common on saplings inoculated with P. noxius, while white rhizomorphs were usually present on the root surface of saplings inoculated with R. microporus.

TI  - Management of fungal root-rot pathogens in tropical <i>Acacia mangium</i> plantations
T2  - FOREST PATHOLOGY
AB  - Acacia mangium is a fast-growing tree species. It is mainly planted in large monocultures for pulpwood in South-East Asia. Root rot has become the most economically damaging disease of this species with high tree mortality rates observed during second and third rotations. Two main types of root rots have been found in A. mangium, viz. brown root-rot and red-root disease caused by Phellinus spp. and Ganoderma spp., respectively. To assess the future management options for root rot of A. mangium, we review past and current disease-management strategies for root rot in different temperate and tropical industrial tree crops. The efficacies of a wide range of silvicultural, chemical and biological options are detailed, and their potential utilization in managing root rot of A. mangium is discussed. We conclude that the current gaps in knowledge regarding identification, biology and disease epidemiology of the root-rot pathogens will need to be addressed so that effective management options can be developed.

TI  - <i>IN VITRO</i> ANTI-LEISMANIAL ACTIVITY OF MALAYSIAN MEDICINAL AND FOREST PLANT SPECIES
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL FOREST SCIENCE
AB  - Leishmaniasis causes major concern around the world as the number of affected patients continues to increase. The available commercial drugs to treat this disease either come with severe side effects or had shown resistance. The current study aims natural products from Malaysian plant species which may be effective against the most prevalent form of leishmania disease, cutaneous leishmaniasis. A total of 106 plant species were collected from two forest reserves in Negeri Sembilan and also purchased from the local market. Methanolic extract samples of plant stem, leaf, seed and/or root were tested for in vitro anti-leishmanial activity using promastigote of Leishmania major as the test organism. Extracts from three plant species showed strong in vitro anti-leishmanial activity: Iguanura geonomiformis (IC50 = 14.66 +/- 0.10 mu g mL(-1); selectivity index (SI) 10.24, Anisophyllea disticha (IC50 = 16.53 +/- 0.17 mu g mL(-1); SI = 11.45) and Swietenia macrophylla (IC50 = 17 +/- 0.07 mu g mL(-1); SI >12). Amphotericin B was used as a positive control drug (IC50 = 0.528 mu M). Results from this study indicated that seed extracts of Swietenia macrophylla showed promising anti-leishmanial activity and warrants further studies to identify the potential bioactive compound as an anti-leishmanial agent.

TI  - Interaction of <i>Haemagogus leucocelaenus</i> (Diptera: Culicidae) and Other Mosquito Vectors in a Forested Area, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE
AB  - The yellow fever (YF) virus has been detected throughout Brazil, with the occurrence of human cases, cyclic epizootics, and its isolation from Haemagogus janthinomys and Hg. leucocelaenus. We assessed the seasonal occurrence, egg abundancy, and oviposition interaction of mosquito vector species captured at a Private Natural Heritage Reserve in the Atlantic Forest biome. A total of 2943 eggs and 1538 mosquito larvae were collected from which 1231 belonged to entomologically important species. Ovitraps were used to collect immature mosquitoes from September 2019 to January 2021. The Mann-Whitney test was used to assess the differences in the abundance of eggs between rainy and dry seasons. Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn's post hoc tests were used to evaluate the significance of the differences in the number of individuals from vector species. The highest percentage of mosquito vector eggs were collected during the rainy season, from December to February. Most eggs recovered from ovitraps belonged to the species Hg. leucocelaenus, representing 85% of all mosquito eggs identified. The other species had lower abundances and percentages: Aedes terrens (7%), Haemagogus janthinomys (5%) and Aedes albopictus (3%). The species that shared breeding sites with a higher frequency were Hg. leucocelaenus and Hg. janthinomys, with a statistically positive correlation (rho = 0.74). This finding suggests that maybe the presence of Hg. leucocelaenus eggs acted as an attractant for Hg. janthinomys or vice versa. An understanding of mosquito oviposition behavior is necessary for the development of surveillance and control approaches directed against specific pathogen vectors of medical and veterinary importance.

TI  - Are Large Herbivores Vectors of Terrestrial Subsidies for Riverine Food Webs?
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
AB  - The tropical savannas of Africa have witnessed a dramatic reduction in native large mammalian herbivore populations. The consequences of these changes for terrestrial-aquatic food-web linkages are poorly documented. We used natural abundances of stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes (delta C-13, delta N-15) to determine spatial and temporal patterns in the importance of herbivore-mediated subsidies for consumers in the Mara River, Kenya. Potential primary producers (terrestrial C3 and C4 producers and periphyton) and consumers (invertebrates and fish) were collected during dry and wet seasons from different sites along the river, representing a gradient from forested highlands to natural savanna grasslands with high herbivore densities across mixed agricultural and livestock-dominated zones. Bayesian mixing models were used to estimate the relative contributions of terrestrial and algal sources of organic carbon supporting consumer trophic groups. Organic carbon sources differed for consumer groups and sites and with season. Overall, periphyton was the major energy source for most consumer groups during the dry season, but with wide 95% confidence intervals. During the wet season, the importance of terrestrial-derived carbon for consumers increased. The importance of C3 producers declined from 40 and 41% at the forested upper reaches to 20 and 8% at river reaches receiving hippo inputs during the dry and wet seasons, respectively. The reciprocal increase in the importance of C4 producers was higher than expected based on areal cover of riparian vegetation that was mainly C3. The importance of C4 producers notably increased from 18 and 10% at the forested upper reaches to 33 and 58% at river reaches receiving hippo inputs during the dry and wet seasons, respectively. This study highlights the importance of large herbivores to the functioning of riverine ecosystems and the potential implications of their loss from savanna landscapes that currently harbor remnant populations. Although the importance of C4 terrestrial carbon in most river systems has been reported to be negligible, this study shows that its importance can be mediated by large herbivores as vectors, which enhance energetic terrestrial-aquatic linkages in rivers in savanna landscapes.

TI  - Personal protection by long-lasting insecticidal hammocks against the bites of forest malaria vectors
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE & INTERNATIONAL HEALTH
AB  - OBJECTIVE In Southeast Asia, malaria vectors bite outside the houses before bedtime, and forest dwellers rarely use insecticide-treated nets (ITNs). Thus, we tested the protection of long-lasting insecticidal hammocks (LLIH) using Olyset (TM) technology against exophagic vectors in two forest villages of Cambodia.
   METHODS In each village, we conducted two entomological surveys ( middle and end of the rainy season), each lasting 10 consecutive nights. These comprised human landing collections during the whole night by people sitting outside in the hammocks. Five households were selected per village, and for each household, two fixed positions were allocated: one for the control and one for the treated hammock.
   RESULTS In total, 6449 mosquitoes were collected from control hammocks compared to 4481 in treated hammocks. Personal protection conferred by the hammocks was 46% (CI 95%: 35-55%) against the bites of Anopheles minimus. A significant reduction of An. dirus bites ( 46% CI 95%: 25-62%) was only observed at the end of the rainy season. An. maculatus and culicines bites were only reduced in one of the two study sites.
   CONCLUSION Even if this LLIH is not inducing full protection against the bites of malaria vectors, it could prove effective in protecting forest workers and villagers before sleeping time. LLIH can be an additional and valuable tool in eliminating artemisinin-resistant malaria in the region.

TI  - Incidence of sleeping sickness and settlement density in the forests of Cote D'Ivoire -: Predicting high risk areas for the establishment of an efficient surveillance network
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE & INTERNATIONAL HEALTH
AB  - In the forests of Cote d'Ivoire a surveillance network is needed to quickly and continuously detect cases of Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT). This requires knowledge of high risk areas, and thus of an appropriate epidemiological indicator. Study of several HAT foci in Cote d'Ivoire shows a striking correlation between epidemiological risk and settlement density by square kilometer (r = 0983; P < 0,05). Epidemiological risk and disease incidence will increase up to the point when human influence eradicates the vector. This hypothesis is supported by the correlation between settlement density (d) and cumulative incidence: i = 0988 d - 0967 (r = 0.951). The prevalence would be 0.5% from 1.5 settlements per km(2), and 1% from a density of 2. The first results of remote sensing indicate that it is possible to identify forest areas where settlement density has reached a critical level.

TI  - Potential distribution of dominant malaria vector species in tropical region under climate change scenarios
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Risk assessment regarding the distribution of malaria vectors and environmental variables underpinning their distribution under changing climates is crucial towards malaria control and eradication. On this basis, we used Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) Model to estimate the potential future distribution of major transmitters of malaria in Nigeria-Anopheles gambiae sensu lato and its siblings: Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto, and Anopheles arabiensis under low and high emissions scenarios. In the model, we used mosquito occurrence data sampled from 1900 to 2010 alongside land use and terrain variables, and bioclimatic variables for baseline climate 1960-1990 and future climates of 2050s (2041-2060) and 2070s (2061-2080) that follow RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 scenarios. The Anopheles gambiae species are projected to experience large shift in potential range and population with increased distribution density, higher under high emissions scenario (RCP8.5) and 2070s than low emission scenario (RCP2.6) and 2050s. Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto and Anopheles arabiensis are projected to have highest invasion with 47-70% and 10-14% percentage increase, respectively in Sahel and Sudan savannas within northern states in 2041-2080 under RCP8.5. Highest prevalence is predicted for Humid forest and Derived savanna in southern and North Central states in 2041-2080; 91-96% and 97-99% for Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto, and 67-71% and 72-75% for Anopheles arabiensis under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5, respectively. The higher magnitude of change in species prevalence predicted for the later part of the 21st century under high emission scenario, driven mainly by increasing and fluctuating temperature, alongside longer seasonal tropical rainfall accompanied by drier phases and inherent influence of rapid land use change, may lead to more significant increase in malaria burden when compared with other periods and scenarios during the century; especially in Humid forest, Derived savanna, Sahel and Sudan savannas.

TI  - DENSITY AND DISTANCE-TO-ADULT EFFECTS OF A CANKER DISEASE OF TREES IN A MOIST TROPICAL FOREST
T2  - OECOLOGIA
AB  - We compared the spatial distribution of stem cankers on the canopy tree Ocotea whitei (Lauraceae) in a 20-ha plot on Barro Colorado Island, Panama, with spatial and temporal patterns of mortality in this host over the previous decade. The cankers occur both on adult and juvenile individuals, although juveniles are much more likely the adults to show symptoms. Disease incidence is host-density dependent, and both the presence of the disease and host mortality are more likely close to than far from a conspecific adult, which resulted in a net spatial shift of the juvenile population away from conspecific adults through time. Disease incidence is lower than expected among juveniles of 0. whitei growing near to adults of the non-susceptible canopy tree Beilschmiedia pendula. The coincidence of spatial patterns of canker incidence and host mortality suggest a role for the disease in regulating host spatial distribution, in agreement with predictions of the Janzen-Connell hypothesis.

TI  - The transcriptional landscape of Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (TC-83) infection
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis Virus (VEEV) is a major biothreat agent that naturally causes outbreaks in humans and horses particularly in tropical areas of the western hemisphere, for which no antiviral therapy is currently available. The host response to VEEV and the cellular factors this alphavirus hijacks to support its effective replication or evade cellular immune responses are largely uncharacterized. We have previously demonstrated tremendous cell-to-cell heterogeneity in viral RNA (vRNA) and cellular transcript levels during flaviviral infection using a novel virus-inclusive single-cell RNA-Seq approach. Here, we used this unbiased, genome-wide approach to simultaneously profile the host transcriptome and vRNA in thousands of single cells during infection of human astrocytes with the live-attenuated vaccine strain of VEEV (TC-83). Host transcription was profoundly suppressed, yet "superproducer cells" with extremely high vRNA abundance emerged during the first viral life cycle and demonstrated an altered transcriptome relative to both uninfected cells and cells with high vRNA abundance harvested at later time points. Additionally, cells with increased structural-to-nonstructural transcript ratio exhibited upregulation of intracellular membrane trafficking genes at later time points. Loss- and gain-of-function experiments confirmed pro- and antiviral activities in both vaccine and virulent VEEV infections among the products of transcripts that positively or negatively correlated with vRNA abundance, respectively. Lastly, comparison with single cell transcriptomic data from other viruses highlighted common and unique pathways perturbed by infection across evolutionary scales. This study provides a high-resolution characterization of the VEEV (TC-83)-host interplay, identifies candidate targets for antivirals, and establishes a comparative single-cell approach to study the evolution of virus-host interactions.
   Author summary
   Little is known about the host response to Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis Virus (VEEV) and the cellular factors this alphavirus hijacks to support effective replication or evade cellular immune responses. Monitoring dynamics of host and viral RNA (vRNA) during viral infection at a single-cell level can provide insight into the virus-host interplay at a high resolution. Here, a single-cell RNA sequencing technology that detects host and viral RNA was used to investigate the interactions between TC-83, the vaccine strain of VEEV, with the human host during the course of infection of U-87 MG cells (human astrocytoma). Virus abundance and host transcriptome were heterogeneous across cells from the same culture. Subsets of differentially expressed genes, positively or negatively correlating with vRNA abundance, were identified and subsequently in vitro validated as candidate proviral and antiviral factors, respectively, in TC-83 and/or virulent VEEV infections. In the first replication cycle, "superproducer" cells exhibited rapid increase in vRNA abundance and unique gene expression patterns. At later time points, cells with increased structural-to-nonstructural transcript ratio demonstrated upregulation of intracellular membrane trafficking genes. Lastly, comparing the VEEV dataset with published datasets on other RNA viruses revealed unique and overlapping responses across viral clades. Overall, this study improves the understanding of VEEV-host interactions, reveals candidate targets for antiviral approaches, and establishes a comparative single-cell approach to study the evolution of virus-host interactions.

TI  - The role of deforestation on American cutaneous leishmaniasis incidence: spatial-temporal distribution, environmental and socioeconomic factors associated in the Brazilian Amazon
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE & INTERNATIONAL HEALTH
AB  - Objective To analyse the temporal and spatial distribution as well as the environmental and socioeconomic factors associated with cutaneous leishmaniasis incidence in the state of Amazonas, Brazil from 2007 to 2015. Methods Spatial and temporal distribution was evaluated from sequential thematic maps of the mean incidence rates of the disease. A negative binomial regression analysis was performed to evaluate the association of the factors studied with the mean incidence rate of ACL. Results The average proportion of deforestation was negatively associated with the average incidence rate of cutaneous leishmaniasis in municipalities (beta = -2.178; P = 0.019; 95%CI -3.996, -0.361), and the health system performance index (effectiveness) (beta = -0.852; P = 0.008; 95%CI -1.481, -0.225). Conversely, the municipal human development index (MHDI) was a factor positively related to the average incidence among the municipalities (beta = 7.728; P = 0.003; 95%CI 2.716, 12.738). Conclusion Our study shows the important impact of socioeconomic and environmental factors on ACL incidence in the Amazonas State.

TI  - Naturally Acquired Humoral Immunity against Malaria Parasites in Non-Human Primates from the Brazilian Amazon, Cerrado and Atlantic Forest
T2  - PATHOGENS
AB  - Non-human primates (NHPs) have been shown to be infected by parasites of the genusPlasmodium, the etiological agent of malaria in humans, creating potential risks of zoonotic transmission.Plasmodium brasilianum, a parasite species similar toP. malariaeof humans, have been described in NHPs from Central and South America, including Brazil. The merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP1), besides being a malaria vaccine candidate, is highly immunogenic. Due to such properties, we tested this protein for the diagnosis of parasite infection. We used recombinant proteins ofP. malariaeMSP1, as well as ofP. falciparumandP. vivax, for the detection of antibodies anti-MSP1 of these parasite species, in the sera of NHPs collected in different regions of Brazil. About 40% of the NHP sera were confirmed as reactive to the proteins of one or more parasite species. A relatively higher number of reactive sera was found in animals from the Atlantic Forest than those from the Amazon region, possibly reflecting the former more intense parasite circulation among NHPs due to their proximity to humans at a higher populational density. The presence ofPlasmodiumpositive NHPs in the surveyed areas, being therefore potential parasite reservoirs, needs to be considered in any malaria surveillance program.

TI  - Vectorborne diseases in West Africa: geographic distribution and geospatial characteristics
T2  - TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - This paper provides an overview of the methods in which geographic information systems (GIS) and remote sensing (RS) technology have been used to visualise and analyse data related to vectorborne diseases (VBD) in West Africa and to discuss the potential for these approaches to be routinely included in future studies of VBDs. GIS/RS studies of diseases that are associated with a specific geographic landscape were reviewed, including malaria, human African trypanosomiasis, leishmaniasis, lymphatic filariasis, Loa loa filariasis, onchocerciasis, Rift Valley fever, dengue, yellow fever, borreliosis, rickettsioses, Buruli ulcer and Q fever. RS data and powerful spatial modelling methods improve our understanding of how environmental factors affect the vectors and transmission of VBDs. There is great potential for the use of GIS/RS technologies in the surveillance, prevention and control of vectorborne and other infectious diseases in West Africa.

TI  - Tracing carbon transfer and assimilation by invertebrates and fish across a tropical mangrove ecosystem using stable isotopes
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY-AN EVOLUTIONARY PERSPECTIVE
AB  - Mangroves are highly productive ecosystems that exhibit a diverse range of habitats, including tidal creeks and flats, forest gaps and interior forest with varying understory light intensity, tidal dynamics, geomorphological settings, and overall biological production. Within mangrove ecosystems, invertebrates and fish feed on heterogeneous food sources, the occurrence of which is unevenly distributed across the system. This provides a basis for testing models of carbon transfer across mangrove ecosystems. We hypothesized that the carbon transfer and assimilation by fish and invertebrates will vary across the different mangrove habitats and that such variations can be predicted by their stable isotope compositions. We analysed delta C-13 and delta N-15 signatures of consumers and their potential organic carbon sources across a tropical mangrove ecosystem in Vietnam. The delta C-13 values of crabs and snails significantly decreased from the tidal flat to interior forest, indicating that variations in carbon transfer and assimilation occurred at small scales <30 m. Reduced variation in delta C-13 of suspension-feeding bivalves suggested that tidal water was a vector for large-scale transport of carbon across the mangrove ecosystem. An analysis of co-variance using habitat as a fixed factor and feeding habit and movement capacity of consumers as co-variates indicated that habitat and feeding types were major features that affected the delta C-13 values of invertebrates and fish. The findings demonstrate that carbon transfer and assimilation across mangrove ecosystems occur as a diverse combination of small (<30 m) and large (>30 m) scale processes.

TI  - Blood-meal preferences and avian malaria detection in mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) captured at different land use types within a neotropical montane cloud forest matrix
T2  - PARASITOLOGY INTERNATIONAL
AB  - Human activities modify environmental conditions, altering ecological interactions that can contribute to the increasing number of vector-borne pathogens affecting both human and wildlife populations. There is a dearth of knowledge about mosquitoes feeding preferences and their role as potential vectors of haemosporidian parasites, particularly in modified habitats. During 2013-2014 we sampled mosquitoes in five different land use types within a cloud forest matrix. From a total of 4107 adult mosquitoes, 90 were engorged. We extracted DNA from mosquito blood-meals, abdomens, and thoraxes, which belonged to seven different species. Seventeen specimens were positive for avian Plasmodium parasites. We were able to identify the blood-meal source of 10 mosquitoes, the identified vertebrate species were: Homo sapiens (Human), Sturnira hondurensis (Bat), and Bos taurus (Cow). Our results show that Culex restuans is positive for avian malaria and it is feeding on both humans and domestic animals at urban and pen-urban habitat types, where it is also an abundant species throughout the year. Furthermore, Aedes quadrivittatus, also positive for avian malaria, is feeding on humans in the well-preserved cloud forest, where this mosquito species is highly abundant. This study is the first in Mexico to provide reference data showing generalist mosquito feeding preferences and presence of avian Plasmodium at locations with different land use types.

TI  - Ticks infesting captive and free-roaming wild animal species at the Sao Paulo Zoo, Sao Paulo, Brazil
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE PARASITOLOGIA VETERINARIA
AB  - Ticks are ectoparasites of worldwide distribution that affect vertebrates and can transmit pathogens to animals and humans. The Zoological Park Foundation of Sao Paulo (FPZSP) is located in a Conservation Unit in one of the most important remaining fragments of the Atlantic Rainforest biome in the suburbs of Sao Paulo, Brazil. The FPZSP houses more than 3,000 wild animals on exhibit, in breeding programs and in environmental education programs, and also attracts migratory birds and free-roaming wildlife. This study focused on identifying the diversity of tick species that infest captive and free-roaming animals at the FPZSP. The collection of ticks kept at the FPZSP contains 523 specimens that were collected from different host species between 1990 and 2017. Ten tick species were found. In addition, Amblyomma aureolatum (Pallas) was found on stray cats living in the Atlantic forest fragment in the FPZSP. This study reveals a low occurrence of parasitism in captive animals and a high diversity of tick species collected from hosts in this Atlantic forest fragment, contributing information about host-parasite relationships and potential vectors of zoonotic diseases, since the vectors of Brazilian spotted fever, A. aureolatum and Amblyomma sculptum Berlese, were found in some hosts.

TI  - Spatial-Temporal Distribution of Hantavirus Rodent-Borne Infection by <i>Oligoryzomys fulvescens</i> in the Agua Buena Region - Panama
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   Hotspot detection and characterization has played an increasing role in understanding the maintenance and transmission of zoonotic pathogens. Identifying the specific environmental factors ( or their correlates) that influence reservoir host abundance help increase understanding of how pathogens are maintained in natural systems and are crucial to identifying disease risk. However, most recent studies are performed at macro-scale and describe broad temporal patterns of population abundances. Few have been conducted at a microscale over short time periods that better capture the dynamical patterns of key populations. These finer resolution studies may better define the likelihood of local pathogen persistence. This study characterizes the landscape distribution and spatio-temporal dynamics of Oligoryzomys fulvescens (O.fulvescens), an important mammalian reservoir in Central America.
   Methods
   Information collected in a longitudinal study of rodent populations in the community of Agua Buena in Tonos, Panama, between April 2006 and December 2009 was analyzed using non- spatial analyses ( box plots) and explicit spatial statistical tests (correlograms, SADIE and LISA). A 90 node grid was built (raster format) to design a base map. The area between the nodes was 0.09 km(2) and the total study area was 6.43 km(2) (2.39 x 2.69 km). The temporal assessment dataset was divided into four periods for each year studied: the dry season, rainy season, and two months-long transitions between seasons ( the months of April and December).
   Results
   There were heterogeneous patterns in the population densities and degrees of dispersion of O. fulvescens that varied across seasons and among years. The species typically was locally absent during the late transitional months of the season, and re-established locally in subsequent years. These populations re-occurred in the same area during the first three years but subsequently re-established further south in the final year of the study. Spatial autocorrelation analyses indicated local populations encompassed approximately 300-600 m. The borders between suitable and unsuitable habitats were sharply demarcated over short distances.
   Conclusion
   Oligoryzomys fulvescens showed a well-defined spatial pattern that evolved over time, and led to a pattern of changing aggregation. Thus, hot spots of abundance showed a general shifting pattern that helps explain the intermittent risk from pathogens transmitted by this species. This variation was associated with seasonality, as well as anthropogenic pressures that occurred with agricultural activities. These factors help define the characteristics of the occurrence, timing, intensity and duration of synanthropic populations affected by human populations and, consequently, possible exposure that local human populations experience.
