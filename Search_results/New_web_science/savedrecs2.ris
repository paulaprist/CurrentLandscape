TI  - Lobomycosis Epidemiology and Management: The Quest for a Cure for the Most Neglected of Neglected Tropical Diseases
T2  - JOURNAL OF FUNGI
AB  - Lobomycosis is a chronic disease caused by Lacazia loboi, which is endemic to the Amazon rainforest, where it affects forest dwellers in Brazil. There is no disease control program and no official therapeutic protocol. This situation contributes to an unknown disease prevalence and unmet needs of people disabled by this disease who seek access to treatment. This review provides an update on the subject with an emphasis on therapeutic advances in humans. All relevant studies that addressed epidemiology, diagnosis, or therapeutics of lobomycosis were considered. Seventy-one articles published between 1931 and 2021 were included for a narrative literature review on the epidemiology and quest for a cure. An effective therapy for lobomycosis has been found following decades of research led by the State Dermatology Program of Acre in the Amazon rainforest, where the largest number of cases occur. This discovery opened new avenues for future studies. The main recommendations here, addressed to the Brazilian Ministry of Health, are for lobomycosis to become a reportable disease to ensure that disease prevalence is measured, and that it be prioritized such that affected individuals may access treatment free-of-charge.

TI  - Individualistic Population Responses of Five Frog Species in Two Changing Tropical Environments over Time
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Roughly 40% of amphibian species are in decline with habitat loss, disease, and climate change being the most cited threats. Heterogeneity of extrinsic (e. g. climate) and intrinsic (e. g. local adaptations) factors across a species' range should influence population response to climate change and other threats. Here we examine relative detectability changes for five direct-developing leaf litter frogs between 42-year sampling periods at one Lowland Tropical Forest site (51 m.a.s.l.) and one Premontane Wet Forest site (1100 m.a.s.l.) in southwest Costa Rica. We identify individualistic changes in relative detectability among populations between sampling periods at different elevations. Both common and rare species showed site-specific declines, and no species exhibited significant declines at both sites. Detection changes are correlated with changes in temperature, dry season rainfall, and leaf litter depth since1969. Our study species share Least Concern conservation status, life history traits, and close phylogenetic relationship, yet their populations changed individualistically both within and among species. These results counter current views of the uniformity or predictability of amphibian decline response and suggest additional complexity for conservation decisions.

TI  - Induction of severe disease in hamsters by two sandfly fever group viruses, Punta Toro and Gabek Forest (<i>Phlebovirus, Bunyaviridae</i>), similar to that caused by rift valley fever virus
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Adult golden hamsters inoculated subcutaneously with either of two sandfly fever group viruses, Punta Toro and Gabek Forest (Phlebovirus, Bunyaviridae), developed a fulminating fatal illness characterized by hepatic and splenic necrosis and interstitial pneumonitis. Most animals died within three days after infection; this was accompanied by high levels of viremia. Necropsy and histopathologic examination of the infected animals revealed pathologic changes involving multiple organs that resembled those described in Rift Valley fever. These two hamster-phlebovirus systems may serve as alternative animal models for Rift Valley fever and should be useful in studying the pathogenesis of severe phlebovirus infection and for testing potential therapeutic agents.

TI  - The relationship between <i>Anopheles gambiae</i> density and rice cultivation in the savannah zone and forest zone of Cote d'Ivoire
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE & INTERNATIONAL HEALTH
AB  - In 13 villages in the savannah zone and 21 villages in the forest zone of Cote d'Ivoire, the biting density of the principal malaria vector, Anopheles gambiae , was studied as a function of rice cultivation in the inland valleys in a 2-km radius around each village. In the savannah villages, during the main season cropping period, surface water on rice-cultivated and to a lesser extent on uncultivated inland valleys seems to contribute strongly to the A. gambiae population density. For the off-season cropping period (which starts after the first light rains in the savannah zone), correlations were weaker. Breeding sites other than in inland valleys may play an important role in the savannah zone. In the forest zone, however, the A. gambiae population density was strongly correlated with the surface water availability (SWA) in the rice-cultivated inland valleys, whereas the correlation with the SWA in other (uncultivated) inland valleys was weak. The requirement of sunlit breeding sites for A. gambiae might explain this difference between zones. In the forest zone, only inland valleys cleared for rice cultivation meet this requirement, whereas all other inland valleys are covered with dense vegetation. In the savannah zone, however, most undergrowth is burnt during the dry season, which permits sunlight to reach puddles resulting from the first rains.

TI  - Diversity and molecular relationships of endophytic <i>Colletotrichum</i> isolates from the Iwokrama Forest Reserve, Gruyana
T2  - MYCOLOGICAL RESEARCH
AB  - The diversity and host specificity were studied of a collection of Colletotrichum strains derived from endophytic colonies in leaves of 12 tree species in the Iwokrama Forest Reserve. Guyana. Analysis included ISSR-PCR and RAPD Molecular fingerprinting techniques, rDNA ITS sequencing and morphological and cultural characterization. Most strains belonged to one of two species, C. gloeosporioides and a further taxon which is probably referable to C. honinense. Almost no strains were found to be genetically identical, indicating that clonal reproduction does not play a prominent role. No degree of host specificity could be detected even at molecular fingerprint level. The implications for estimation of fungal diversity in closed tropical forests may be profound.

TI  - Cascading community and ecosystem consequences of introduced coconut palms (<i>Cocos nucifera</i>) in tropical islands
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY
AB  - Biological invasions are a pervasive and dominant form of anthropogenic disturbance. However, we seldom have the opportunity to evaluate the long-term, indirect, and often slow-moving cascading effects of invasions at the community and ecosystem scale. Here we synthesize the collective knowledge from 10 years of study on the influence of the deep historical introduction of coconut palms (Cocos nucifera L.) across a series of islets at Palmyra Atoll. Through a suite of pathways, we find this palm drives near-complete ecosystem state change when it becomes dominant. Abiotic conditions are transformed, with major soil nutrients 2.7-11.5 times lower and water stress 15% elevated in palm- dominated forests compared with native forest. Faunal communities are likewise dramatically altered, not only in composition but also in behavior, body size, and body condition. Biotic interactions, including herbivory rates, palatability, and seed predation, are likewise changed. Cumulatively, these changes transform food webs, leading to dramatically shortened and simplified food chains in invaded ecosystems. Many of these changes appear to create slow- acting feedback loops that favor the palm at the expense of native species. Given the widespread nature of this historical introduction, many island and coastal regions of tropical oceans may be similarly transformed.

TI  - Radial growth trends of sugar maple (<i>Acer saccharum</i>) in an Allegheny northern hardwood forest affected by beech bark disease
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE TORREY BOTANICAL SOCIETY
AB  - In many forests of the northeastern U.S., canopy gaps are the predominant mode of disturbance and thus regulate future forest structure and species composition. We examined radial growth trends in canopy and subcanopy sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) trees growing in gaps and non-gap areas in three second-growth, Allegheny northern hardwood forest stands in central New York. Our objective was to determine if a recent diffuse disturbance of the canopy caused by beech bark disease stimulated growth of sugar maple trees in gaps and throughout the forest. Annual radial growth (mm/yr) of canopy gap-edge trees and subcanopy trees in gaps was significantly greater than that of canopy trees and subcanopy trees in non-gap areas. During the period of beech bark disease-induced canopy decline, non-gap subcanopy trees exhibited an annual radial growth 30% higher and a radial growth rate (mm/yr/yr) four times greater than during the years prior to the disturbance. In contrast, canopy trees not adjacent to gaps showed no change in radial growth coincident with the disturbance. These results suggest that in forests with significant canopy deterioration, differences in tree growth between gap and nongap environments can be expected; however, positive growth responses among sub-canopy trees may not be limited to the area directly in gaps and instead may occur throughout the forest.

TI  - Breeding polyploid varieties of tropical acacias: progress and prospects
T2  - SOUTHERN FORESTS-A JOURNAL OF FOREST SCIENCE
CP  - 1st International Meeting on Sustaining the Future of Acacia Plantation Forestry
AB  - The paper reviews a decade of progress with breeding new polyploid varieties of Acacia mangium and other tropical acacias in Vietnam, and outlines plans for future strategies to complement conventional diploid breeding. Polyploid breeding is a means of introducing diversity into breeding populations, of making step-change improvements in wood fibre and other properties, and reducing reproductive output of these potentially weedy taxa. To date we have demonstrated that A. mangium tetraploids have larger and thicker wood fibres and we have strong preliminary evidence that the reproductive output of triploids is indeed reduced. Other potential benefits such as wind and stress tolerance and disease resistance are under field evaluation. Trials demonstrate that colchicine-induced tetraploids, whether derived from pure A. mangium seeds or from commercial hybrid clones, are substantially slower growing than diploids. While not the sole determinant of crop value, volume production is hugely important to growers, so long-term success of the program is critically dependent upon demonstration that this problem can be resolved in advanced generations. Future emphasis will be on production of triploid and tetraploids from the interspecific hybrid A. mangium x A. auriculiformis. The better rooting ability contributed by A. auriculiformis maximises prospects for operational cloning of select trees. Highly heterozygous hybrids also offer the better prospect for exploiting heterosis. A strategy for developing a diverse breeding population of neo-tetraploid F-1 hybrids is presented.

TI  - Organization of oversight for integrated control of neglected tropical diseases within Ministries of Health
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are communicable diseases that impact approximately 1 billion people, but receive relatively little research, funding, and attention. Many NTDs have similar treatments, epidemiology, and geographic distribution, and as a result, the integration of control efforts can improve accountability, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness of programs. Here, we examine the landscape of efforts towards NTD integration across countries with the highest burden of disease, and review the administrative management of integration in order to identify approaches and pathways for integration.
   Methodology and principal findings
   We utilized a standardized system to score countries for NTD endemnicity to create a list of 25 countries with the highest overall burden of NTDs. We then conducted a literature review to characterize the NTD control programs in the focus countries. Six countries were selected for key informant interviews to validate literature review results and gather additional data on opportunities and obstacles to NTD integration, from an administrative perspective. The majority of countries included in the study were located in Africa, with the remainder from Asia, North America, and South America. Multiple models and pathways were observed for the integration of NTD programs, in combination with other NTD programs, other diseases, or other health programs. Substantial heterogeneity existed with respect to the NTD control programs, and no country had integrated all of their NTD control efforts into a single program. NTDs that can be treated with preventative chemotherapy were frequently integrated into a single program. Leprosy control was also frequently integrated with those of other communicable diseases, and notably tuberculosis. Barriers to NTD integration may result from internal administrative obstacles or external obstacles.
   Conclusions
   Although many countries have begun to integrate NTD control efforts, additional work will be required to realize the full benefits of integration in most of the countries examined here. Moving forward, NTD integration efforts must ensure that administrative structures are designed to maximize the potential success of integrated programs and account for existing administrative processes.

TI  - Multidisciplinary re-description of <i>Plasmodium</i> (<i>Novyella</i>) <i>paranucleophilum</i> in Brazilian wild birds of the Atlantic Forest kept in captivity
T2  - PARASITOLOGY RESEARCH
AB  - Haemosporidian blood parasites of the Plasmodium genus are the causative agents of avian malaria in many parts of the world. Despite the great diversity of Brazilian avifauna, few studies have been conducted to examine the haemosporidians of wild birds found in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, especially those kept in captivity. This study aimed to re-examine and further characterize the South American avian parasite Plasmodium paranucleophilum using a multidisciplinary approach. Blood samples were collected from 68 captive birds representing 15 species found in the Atlantic Forest of southeastern Brazil. Morphometric and morphological characterization was performed, in addition to PCR and sequencing of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene and subsequent phylogenetic analysis. The overall prevalence of P. paranucleophilum infection in the study was 13.23% (n = 9), with a mean parasitemia of 0.58%. We observed the highest parasitemia of 3.88% in Rupornis magnirostris. In our phylogenetic analysis, P. paranucleophilum and P lasmodium nucleophilum formed distinct, highly supported clades, with a mean genetic divergence of 2.48%. This study provides new morphological and molecular data, expanding our knowledge of the haemosporidians of wild birds in Brazil and highlighting the need for further investigation. The true depth of diversity in Brazilian avian haemosporidians remains largely unknown, and given the enormous variety of vectors and avian species, there may be many more species of these blood parasites yet to be described.

T2  - MEMORIAS DO INSTITUTO OSWALDO CRUZ
AB  - This study was conducted in a meteorological tower located in the Caxiuana Forest (municipality of Melgaco, Para, Brazil) with the aim of assessing the vertical stratification of species of Haemagogus and Sabethes, potential vectors of the yellow fever virus. To investigate the role of microclimates in mosquito stratification, bimonthly collections were conducted at ground level (0 m), 8 m, 16 m and 30 m (canopy level), with the aid of entomological nets and suction tubes, from July 2005-April 2006. A total of 25,498 mosquitoes were collected; specimens of Sabethes sp. and Haemagogus janthinomys were found mostly at heights of 16 m and 30 m while Hg. leucocelaenus was most frequently observed at ground level. The largest number of vector species was collected during the rainiest months, but this difference between seasons was not statistically significant. However, the number of Hg. janthinomys was positively correlated with variations in temperature and relative humidity.

T2  - CLIMATIC CHANGE
CP  - International Workshop on Reducing Vulnerability of Agriculture and Forestry to Climate Variability and Climate Change
AB  - Although there are different results from different studies, most assessments indicate that climate variability would have negative effects on agriculture and forestry in the humid and sub-humid tropics. Cereal crop yields would decrease generally with even minimal increases in temperature. For commercial crops, extreme events such as cyclones, droughts and floods lead to larger damages than only changes of mean climate. Impacts of climate variability on livestock mainly include two aspects; impacts on animals such as increase of heat and disease stress-related death, and impacts on pasture. As to forestry, climate variability would have negative as well as some positive impacts on forests of humid and sub-humid tropics. However, in most tropical regions, the impacts of human activities such as deforestation will be more important than climate variability and climate change in determining natural forest cover.

TI  - Experimental evidence for a phylogenetic Janzen-Connell effect in a subtropical forest
T2  - ECOLOGY LETTERS
AB  - Observational evidence increasingly suggests that the JanzenConnell effect extends beyond the species boundary. However, this has not been confirmed experimentally. Herein, we present both observational and experimental evidence for a phylogenetic JanzenConnell effect. In a subtropical forest in Guangdong province, China, we observed that co-occurring tree species are less phylogenetically related than expected. The inhibition effects of neighbouring trees on seedling survival decreased with increasing phylogenetic distance between them. In a shade-house experiment, we studied seedling survival of eight species on soil collected close to Castanopsis fissa relative to their survival on soil close to their own adult trees, and found that this relative survival rate increased with phylogenetic distance from C. fissa. This phylogenetic signal disappeared when seedlings were planted in fungicide-treated soil. Our results clearly support negative effects of phylogenetically similar neighbouring trees on seedling survival and suggest that these effects are caused by associated host-specific fungal pathogens.

TI  - Complexity of malaria transmission dynamics in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest
T2  - CURRENT RESEARCH IN PARASITOLOGY & VECTOR-BORNE DISEASES
AB  - Plasmodium malariae and Plasmodium vivax are protozoan parasites that can cause malaria in humans. They are genetically indistinguishable from, respectively, Plasmodium brasilianum and Plasmodium simium, i.e. parasites infecting New World non-human primates in South America. In the tropical rainforests of the Brazilian Atlantic coast, it has long been hypothesized that P. brasilianum and P. simium in platyrrhine primates originated from P. malariae and P. vivax in humans. A recent hypothesis proposed the inclusion of Plasmodium falciparum into the transmission dynamics between humans and non-human primates in the Brazilian Atlantic tropical rainforest. Herein, we assess the occurrence of human malaria in simians and sylvatic anophelines using field-collected samples in the Capivari-Monos Environmental Protection Area from 2015 to 2017. We first tested simian blood and anopheline samples. Two simian (Aloutta) blood samples (18%, n = 11) showed Plasmodium cytb DNA sequences, one for P. vivax and another for P. malariae. From a total of 9,416 anopheline females, we found 17 pools positive for Plasmodium species with a 18S qPCR assay. Only three showed P. cytb DNA sequence, one for P. vivax and the others for rodent malaria species (similar to Plasmodium chabaudi and Plasmodium berghei). Based on these results, we tested 25 rodent liver samples for the presence of Plasmodium and obtained P. falciparum cytb DNA sequence in a rodent (Oligoryzomys sp.) liver. The findings of this study indicate complex malaria transmission dynamics composed by parallel spillover-spillback of human malaria parasites, i.e. P. malariae, P. vivax, and P. falciparum, in the Brazilian Atlantic forest.

TI  - Primates in 21st Century Ecosystems: Does Primate Conservation Promote Ecosystem Conservation?
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY
AB  - Contributors to this issue of the American Journal of Primatology were among the participants in an invited symposium at the 2008 Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation meeting in Paramaribo, Suriname. They were asked to assess how essential primates are to tropical ecosystems and, given their research interests, discuss how primate research contributes to the broader understanding about how ecosystems function. This introduction to the issue is divided into three parts: a review of the roles that nonhuman primates play in tropical ecosystems; the implementation of large-scale landscape methods used to identify primate densities; and concerns about the increasingly porous boundaries between humans, nonhuman primates, and pathogens. Although 20th century primate research created a rich database on individual species, including both theoretical and descriptive approaches, the dual effects of high human population densities and widespread habitat destruction should warn us that creative, interdisciplinary and human-related research is needed to solve 21st century problems.

TI  - Ceratopogonidae (Diptera: Nematocera) of the piedmont of the Yungas forests of Tucuman: ecology and distribution
T2  - PEERJ
AB  - Within the Ceratopogonidae family, many genera transmit numerous diseases to humans and animals, while others are important pollinators of tropical crops. In the Yungas ecoregion of Argentina, previous systematic and ecological research on Ceratopogonidae focused on Culicoides, since they are the main transmitters of mansonelliasis in northwestern Argentina; however, few studies included the genera Forcipomyia, Dasyhelea, Atrichopogon, Alluaudomyia, Echinohelea, and Bezzia. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the presence and abundance of Ceratopogonidae in this region, their association with meteorological variables, and their variation in areas disturbed by human activity. Monthly collection of specimens was performed from July 2008 to July 2009 using CDC miniature light traps deployed for two consecutive days. A total of 360 specimens were collected, being the most abundant Dasyhelea genus (48.06%) followed by Forcipomyia (26.94%) and Atrichopogon (13.61%). Bivariate analyses showed significant differences in the abundance of the genera at different sampling sites and climatic conditions, with the summer season and El Corralito site showing the greatest abundance of specimens. Accumulated rainfall was the variable that related the most to the abundance of Culicoides (10.56%), while temperature was the most closely related variable to the abundance of Forcipomyia, Dasyhelea, and Atrichopogon.

TI  - Host-Feeding Patterns of the Mosquito Assemblage at Lomas Barbudal Biological Reserve, Guanacaste, Costa Rica
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - Mosquito-borne pathogens have spread throughout tropical regions of the Western Hemisphere causing increased burden of disease in the region. Outbreaks of dengue fever, yellow fever, chikungunya, West Nile, and Zika have occurred over the past several years. Mosquito blood-feeding patterns need to be assayed to assist in determining which vertebrates could act as hosts of these mosquito-borne pathogens and which mosquito species could act as vectors. We conducted bloodmeal analyses of mosquitoes collected at Lomas Barbudal Biological Reserve, a dry tropical forest reserve in Costa Rica. Mosquitoes were collected using backpack aspirators and light, gravid, and resting traps, and then identified morphologically. Blood-fed mosquitoes underwent DNA extraction, PCR amplification, and sequencing of the vertebrate cytochrome b and cytochrome c oxidase 1 genes to identify vertebrate bloodmeal hosts. Several mosquitoes known to vector pathogens were found including Culex (Melanoconion) erraticus Dyar & Knab (Diptera: Culicidae), Cx. (Mel.) pedroi Sirivanakarn & Belkin, Aedes (Stegomyia) albopictus Skuse, Ae. (Ochlerotatus) scapularis Rondani, Ae. (Och.) serratus Theobald, and Ae. (Och.) taeniorhynchus Wiedemann. The most common bloodmeal hosts were basilisk lizards (Basiliscus vittatus) Wiegmann (Squamata: Corytophanidae) in Culex (Linnaeus) species and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) Zimmermann (Artiodactyla: Cervidae) in Aedes (Meigen) species. These results show the diversity of mosquito species in a tropical dry deciduous forest and identify associations between mosquito vectors and potential pathogen reservoir hosts. Our study highlights the importance of understanding interactions between vector species and their hosts that could serve as predictors for the potential emergence or resurgence of mosquito-borne pathogens in Costa Rica.

TI  - Determining seropositivity-A review of approaches to define population seroprevalence when using multiplex bead assays to assess burden of tropical diseases
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background Serological surveys with multiplex bead assays can be used to assess seroprevalence to multiple pathogens simultaneously. However, multiple methods have been used to generate cut-off values for seropositivity and these may lead to inconsistent interpretation of results. A literature review was conducted to describe the methods used to determine cut-off values for data generated by multiplex bead assays. Methodology/Principal findings A search was conducted in PubMed that that included articles published from January 2010 to January 2020, and 291 relevant articles were identified that included the terms "serology", "cut-offs", and "multiplex bead assays". After application of exclusion of articles not relevant to neglected tropical diseases (NTD), vaccine preventable diseases (VPD), or malaria, 55 articles were examined based on their relevance to NTD or VPD. The most frequently applied approaches to determine seropositivity included the use of presumed unexposed populations, mixture models, receiver operating curves (ROC), and international standards. Other methods included the use of quantiles, pre-exposed endemic cohorts, and visual inflection points. Conclusions/Significance For disease control programmes, seropositivity is a practical and easily interpretable health metric but determining appropriate cut-offs for positivity can be challenging. Considerations for optimal cut-off approaches should include factors such as methods recommended by previous research, transmission dynamics, and the immunological backgrounds of the population. In the absence of international standards for estimating seropositivity in a population, the use of consistent methods that align with individual disease epidemiological data will improve comparability between settings and enable the assessment of changes over time.
   Author summary Serological surveys can provide information regarding population-level disease exposure by assessing immune responses created during infection. Multiplex bead assays (MBAs) allow for an integrated serological platform to monitor antibody responses to multiple pathogens concurrently. As programs adopt integrated disease control strategies, MBAs are especially advantageous since many of these diseases may be present in the same population and antibodies against all pathogens of interest can be detected simultaneously from a single blood sample. Interpreting serological data in a programmatic context typically involves classifying individuals as seronegative or seropositive using a 'cut-off', whereby anyone with a response above the defined threshold is considered to be seropositive. Although studies increasingly test blood samples with MBAs, published studies have applied different methods of determining seropositivity cut-offs, making results difficult to compare across settings and over time. The lack of harmonized methods for defining seropositivity is due to the absence of international standards, pathogen biology, or assay-specific methods that may impact resulting data. This review highlights the need for a standardized approach for which cut-off methods to use per pathogen when applied to integrated disease surveillance using platforms such as MBAs.

TI  - Comparison of UAV and SAR performance for Crop type classification using machine learning algorithms: a case study of humid forest ecology experimental research site of West Africa
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Food insecurity is one of the major challenges facing African countries; therefore, timely and accurate information on agricultural production is essential to feed the growing population on the continent. A synergistic approach comprising a high-resolution multispectral UAV optical dataset and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) can help understand spectral features of target objects, especially with crop type identification. We conducted this work on the experimental plots using high spatial resolution multispectral UAV data (12 cm, re-sampled to 50 cm) in combination with the Sentinel 1C Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) dataset. We generated 11 agronomically relevent vegetation indices from the UAV multispectral image. Multiple combinations of the UAV datasets were analysed to assess the impact of canopy height model (CHM) on classification accuracy and to determine the optimum dataset (including spatial resolution) for the land cover classification. We also appraise the impact of variable spatial resolution on classification accuracy. A combination of VH and VV polarizations of Sentinel-1 SAR data was also analysed to classify the crop types while comparing its accuracy with the UAV-derived models. Our results show that model accuracy is improved- for all the data combination pairs, when CHM is added to the modelling. We also observed a decreasing trend in classification accuracy with respect to increasing spatial resolution. Generally, the support vector machine (SVM) classifier produced an overall accuracy of 94.78% and 81.72% for UAV and SAR datasets, respectively. In comparison, the random forest (RF) achieved an accuracy of 93.84% and 92.58%, for UAV and SAR datasets, respectively. The outputs from ground-based validation corroborate the results from model-based classification coupled with acceptable simple models' agreement ratio (SMAR), exceeding 90% in some cases. The combined techniques can be useful in precision agriculture over small and large agricultural fields to support food security assessment and planning.

TI  - Emergent arboviruses in Brazil
T2  - REVISTA DA SOCIEDADE BRASILEIRA DE MEDICINA TROPICAL
AB  - Brazil is a large tropical country (8,514,215km(2)) with 185,360,000 inbabitants. More than one third of its territory is covered by tropical forests or other natural ecosystems. These provide ideal conditions for the existence of many arboviruses, which are maintained in a large variety of zoonotic cycles. The risk that new arboviruses might emerge in Brazil is related to the existence of large, densely populated cities that are infested by mosquitoes such as Culex and the highly anthropophilic Aedes aegypti. Infected humans or animals may come into these cities from ecological-epidemiological settings where arbovirus zoonoses occur. This study analyzes the risk of emergence of the alphaviruses Mayaro, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, Eastern equine encephalitis and Chikungunya; the flaviviruses yellow fever, Rocio, Saint Louis encephalitis and West Nile, and the ortbobunyavirus Oropouche.

TI  - An Insect Nidovirus Emerging from a Primary Tropical Rainforest
T2  - MBIO
AB  - Tropical rainforests show the highest level of terrestrial biodiversity and may be an important contributor to microbial diversity. Exploitation of these ecosystems may foster the emergence of novel pathogens. We report the discovery of the first insect-associated nidovirus, tentatively named Cavally virus (CAVV). CAVV was found with a prevalence of 9.3% during a survey of mosquito-associated viruses along an anthropogenic disturbance gradient in Cote d'Ivoire. Analysis of habitat-specific virus diversity and ancestral state reconstruction demonstrated an origin of CAVV in a pristine rainforest with subsequent spread into agriculture and human settlements. Virus extension from the forest was associated with a decrease in virus diversity (P < 0.01) and an increase in virus prevalence (P < 0.00001). CAVV is an enveloped virus with large surface projections. The RNA genome comprises 20,108 nucleotides with seven major open reading frames (ORFs). ORF1a and -1b encode two large proteins that share essential features with phylogenetically higher representatives of the order Nidovirales, including the families Coronavirinae and Torovirinae, but also with families in a basal phylogenetic relationship, including the families Roniviridae and Arteriviridae. Genetic markers uniquely conserved in nidoviruses, such as an endoribonuclease-and helicase-associated zinc-binding domain, are conserved in CAVV. ORF2a and -2b are predicted to code for structural proteins S and N, respectively, while ORF3a and -3b encode proteins with membrane-spanning regions. CAVV produces three subgenomic mRNAs with 5' leader sequences (of different lengths) derived from the 5' end of the genome. This novel cluster of mosquito-associated nidoviruses is likely to represent a novel family within the order Nidovirales.
   IMPORTANCE Knowledge of microbial diversity in tropical rainforests is sparse, and factors driving the emergence of novel pathogens are poorly understood. We discovered and mapped the spread and genetic evolution of a novel mosquito nidovirus from a pristine rainforest to human settlements. Notably, virus diversity decreased and prevalence increased during the process of spreading into disturbed habitats. The novel virus, tentatively termed Cavally virus, contains genetic features common to members of the order Nidovirales (families Coronaviridae, Arteriviridae, and Roniviridae), including conservation of the replicase machinery and expression of subgenomic RNA messages, has a basal phylogenetic relationship to the family Coronaviridae, and clearly differs from the established nidovirus families. Inclusion of this putative novel family in the nidovirus phylogeny suggests that nidoviruses may have evolved from arthropods.

TI  - Urbanization predicts infection risk by a protozoan parasite in non-migratory populations of monarch butterflies from the southern coastal US and Hawaii
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
AB  - Context Urbanization can affect the density of hosts, altering patterns of infection risk in wildlife. Most studies examining associations between urbanization and host-parasite interactions have focused on vertebrate wildlife that carry zoonotic pathogens, and less is known about responses of other host taxa, including insects.
   Objectives Here we ask whether urban development predicts infection by a protozoan, Ophyrocystis elektroscirrha, in three populations of monarchs (Danaus plexippus): migratory monarchs in northeastern U.S., non-migratory monarchs in southeastern coastal U.S., and non-migratory monarchs in Hawaii.
   Methods We used impervious surface and developed land cover classes from the National Land Cover Database to derive proportional measures of urban development and an index of land cover aggregation at two spatial scales. Parasite data were from previous field sampling (Hawaii) and a citizen science project focused on monarch infection in North America.
   Results Proportional measures of urban development predicted greater infection prevalence for non-migratory monarchs sampled in the southern coastal U.S. and Hawaii, but not in the northern U.S. Aggregations of low intensity development, dominated by single-family housing, predicted greater infection prevalence in monarchs from the northern and southern coastal U.S. populations, but predicted lower infection prevalence in Hawaii.
   Conclusions Because natural habitats have been reduced by land-use change, plantings for monarchs in residential areas and urban gardens has become popular among the public. Mechanisms that underlie higher infection prevalence in urban landscapes remain unknown. Further monitoring and experimental studies are needed to inform strategies for habitat management to lower infection risk for monarchs.

CP  - International Congress on Modelling and Simulation
AB  - Factors that control the stability of mountain slopes may be in a tenuous state of equilibrium that can easily be upset by timber harvesting, vegetation conversion, and road construction. Shallow, rapid landslides are the dominant erosion and sediment delivery mechanisms in much of the steep terrain worldwide, especially where rainfall is high. Deep and dense tree root systems often contribute the additional component of soil shear strength necessary to insure long term stability of steep slopes. Road and foot paths may redistribute water onto marginally stable hillsides or hollows, promoting slope failure. Here we present a distributed shallow landslide model that captures the temporal dynamics of imposed management scenarios at the catchment scale. This physically-based model incorporates a planar infinite slope analysis module (based on factor of safety analysis), a kinematic wave groundwater module, and a module for continuous temporal changes in root cohesion and vegetation surcharge. The distributed landslide model is integrated with GIS and a topographic analysis, which partitions the basin into vector-based stream tube elements. Recent developments include evaluations of complex timber harvesting scenarios and assessing the effects of rainfall characteristics on landslide potential. Examples are presented showing the application of this landslide model to temporal scenarios of vegetation management in steep catchments . Benefits of using longer forest harvesting rotations are shown in a steep catchment on Vancouver Island, British Columbia. Potential applications of the model are discussed in managed tropical catchments where forest conversion may increase landslide potential. A major drawback of such distributed models is that they require rather intensive data inputs and are thus difficult to apply in remote areas.

TI  - Looking in apes as a source of human pathogens
T2  - MICROBIAL PATHOGENESIS
AB  - Because of the close genetic relatedness between apes and humans, apes are susceptible to many human infectious agents and can serve as carriers of these pathogens. Consequently, they present a serious health hazard to humans. Moreover, many emerging infectious diseases originate in wildlife and continue to threaten human populations, especially vector-borne diseases described in great apes, such as malaria and rickettsiosis. These wild primates may be permanent reservoirs and important sources of human pathogens. In this special issue, we report that apes, including chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), bonobos (Pan paniscus), gorillas (Gorilla gorilla and Gorilla beringei), orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus and Pongo abelii), gibbons (Hylobates spp., Hoolock spp. and Nomascus spp) and siamangs (Symphalangus syndactylus syndactylus and Symphalangus continentis), have many bacterial, viral, fungal and parasitic species that are capable of infecting humans. Serious measures should be adopted in tropical forests and sub-tropical areas where habitat overlaps are frequent to survey and prevent infectious diseases from spreading from apes to people.

TI  - Detecting the Early Stage of Phaeosphaeria Leaf Spot Infestations in Maize Crop Using In Situ Hyperspectral Data and Guided Regularized Random Forest Algorithm
T2  - JOURNAL OF SPECTROSCOPY
AB  - Phaeosphaeria leaf spot (PLS) is considered one of the major diseases that threaten the stability of maize production in tropical and subtropical African regions. The objective of the present study was to investigate the use of hyperspectral data in detecting the early stage of PLS in tropical maize. Field data were collected from healthy and the early stage of PLS over two years (2013 and 2014) using a handheld spectroradiometer. An integration of a newly developed guided regularized random forest (GRRF) and a traditional random forest (RF) was used for feature selection and classification, respectively. The 2013 dataset was used to train the model, while the 2014 dataset was used as independent test dataset. Results showed that there were statistically significant differences in biochemical concentration between the healthy leaves and leaves that were at an early stage of PLS infestation. The newly developed GRRF was able to reduce the high dimensionality of hyperspectral data by selecting key wavelengths with less autocorrelation. These wavelengths are located at 420 nm, 795 nm, 779 nm, 1543 nm, 1747 nm, and 1010 nm. Using these variables (n = 6), a random forest classifier was able to discriminate between the healthy maize and maize at an early stage of PLS infestation with an overall accuracy of 88% and a kappa value of 0.75. Overall, our study showed potential application of hyperspectral data, GRRF feature selection, and RF classifiers in detecting the early stage of PLS infestation in tropical maize.

TI  - Changes of effective gene dispersal distances by pollen and seeds across successive life stages in a tropical tree
T2  - OIKOS
AB  - Pollen and seed dispersal are the two key processes in which plant genes move in space, mostly mediated by animal dispersal vectors in tropical forests. Due to the movement patterns of pollinators and seed dispersers and subsequent complex spatial patterns in the mortality of offspring, we have little knowledge of how pollinators and seed dispersers affect effective gene dispersal distances across successive recruitment stages. Using six highly polymorphic microsatellite loci and parentage analyses, we quantified pollen dispersal, seed dispersal, and effective paternal and maternal gene dispersal distances from pollen- and seed-donors to offspring across four recruitment stages within a population of the monoecious tropical tree Prunus africana in western Kenya. In general, pollen-dispersal and paternal gene dispersal distances were much longer than seed-dispersal and maternal gene dispersal distances, with the long-distance within-population gene dispersal in P. africana being mostly mediated by pollinators. Seed dispersal, paternal and maternal gene dispersal distances increased significantly across recruitment stages, suggesting strong density- and distance-dependent mortality near the parent trees. Pollen dispersal distances also varied significantly, but inconsistently across recruitment stages. The mean dispersal distance was initially much (23-fold) farther for pollen than for seeds, yet the pollen-to-seed dispersal distance ratio diminished by an order of magnitude at later stages as maternal gene dispersal distances disproportionately increased. Our study elucidates the relative changes in the contribution of the two processes, pollen and seed dispersal, to effective gene dispersal across recruitment. Overall, complex sequential processes during recruitment contribute to the genetic make-up of tree populations. This highlights the importance of a multistage perspective for a comprehensive understanding of the impact of animal-mediated pollen and seed dispersal on small-scale spatial genetic patterns of long-lived tree species.

TI  - Malaria transmission and vector behaviour in a forested malaria focus in central Vietnam and the implications for vector control
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
AB  - Background: In Vietnam, malaria is becoming progressively restricted to specific foci where human and vector characteristics alter the known malaria epidemiology, urging for alternative or adapted control strategies. Long-lasting insecticidal hammocks (LLIH) were designed and introduced in Ninh Thuan province, south-central Vietnam, to control malaria in the specific context of forest malaria. An entomological study in this specific forested environment was conducted to assess the behavioural patterns of forest and village vectors and to assess the spatio-temporal risk factors of malaria transmission in the province.
   Methods: Five entomological surveys were conducted in three villages in Ma Noi commune and in five villages in Phuoc Binh commune in Ninh Thuan Province, south-central Vietnam. Collections were made inside the village, at the plot near the slash-and-burn fields in the forest and on the way to the forest. All collected mosquito species were subjected to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect Plasmodium in the head-thoracic portion of individual mosquitoes after morphological identification. Collection data were analysed by use of correspondence and multivariate analyses.
   Results: The mosquito density in the study area was low with on average 3.7 anopheline bites per man-night and 17.4 culicine bites per man-night. Plasmodium-infected mosquitoes were only found in the forest and on the way to the forest. Malaria transmission in the forested malaria foci was spread over the entire night, from dusk to dawn, but was most intense in the early evening as nine of the 13 Plasmodium positive bites occurred before 21H. The annual entomological inoculation rate of Plasmodium falciparum was 2.2 infective bites per person-year to which Anopheles dirus s.s. and Anopheles minimus s.s. contributed. The Plasmodium vivax annual entomological inoculation rate was 2.5 infective bites per person-year with Anopheles sawadwongporni, Anopheles dirus s.s. and Anopheles pampanai as vectors.
   Conclusion: The vector behaviour and spatio-temporal patterns of malaria transmission in Southeast Asia impose new challenges when changing objectives from control to elimination of malaria and make it necessary to focus not only on the known main vector species. Moreover, effective tools to prevent malaria transmission in the early evening and in the early morning, when the treated bed net cannot be used, need to be developed.

TI  - Co-occurrence Patterns of the Dengue Vector Aedes aegypti and Aedes mediovitattus, a Dengue Competent Mosquito in Puerto Rico
T2  - ECOHEALTH
AB  - Aedes aegypti is implicated in dengue transmission in tropical and subtropical urban areas around the world. Ae. aegypti populations are controlled through integrative vector management. However, the efficacy of vector control may be undermined by the presence of alternative, competent species. In Puerto Rico, a native mosquito, Ae. mediovittatus, is a competent dengue vector in laboratory settings and spatially overlaps with Ae. aegypti. It has been proposed that Ae. mediovittatus may act as a dengue reservoir during inter-epidemic periods, perpetuating endemic dengue transmission in rural Puerto Rico. Dengue transmission dynamics may therefore be influenced by the spatial overlap of Ae. mediovittatus, Ae. aegypti, dengue viruses, and humans. We take a landscape epidemiology approach to examine the association between landscape composition and configuration and the distribution of each of these Aedes species and their co-occurrence. We used remotely sensed imagery from a newly launched satellite to map landscape features at very high spatial resolution. We found that the distribution of Ae. aegypti is positively predicted by urban density and by the number of tree patches, Ae. mediovittatus is positively predicted by the number of tree patches, but negatively predicted by large contiguous urban areas, and both species are predicted by urban density and the number of tree patches. This analysis provides evidence that landscape composition and configuration is a surrogate for mosquito community composition, and suggests that mapping landscape structure can be used to inform vector control efforts as well as to inform urban planning.

TI  - Landscape characterization of peridomestic risk for Lyme disease using satellite imagery
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Remotely sensed characterizations of landscape composition were evaluated for Lyme disease exposure risk on 337 residential properties in two communities of suburban Westchester County, New York. Properties were categorized as no, low, or high risk based on seasonally adjusted densities of Ixodes scapularis nymphs, determined by drag sampling during June and July 1990. Spectral indices based on Landsat Thematic Mapper data provided relative measures of vegetation structure and moisture (wetness), as well as vegetation abundance (greenness). A geographic information system (GIS) was used to spatially quantify and relate the remotely sensed landscape variables to risk category. A comparison of the two communities showed that Chappaqua, which had more high-risk properties (P < 0.001), was significantly greener and wetter than Armonk (P < 0.001). Furthermore, within Chappaqua, highrisk properties were significantly greener and wetter than lower-risk properties in this community (P < 0.01). The high-risk properties appeared to contain a greater proportion of broadleaf trees, while lower-risk properties were interpreted as having a greater proportion of nonvegetative cover and/or open lawn. The ability to distinguish these fine scale differences among communities and individual properties illustrates the efficiency of a remote sensing/GIS-based approach for identifying peridomestic risk of Lyme disease over large geographic areas.

TI  - How will climate change pathways and mitigation options alter incidence of vector-borne diseases? A framework for leishmaniasis in South and Meso-America
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - The enormous global burden of vector-borne diseases disproportionately affects poor people in tropical, developing countries. Changes in vector-borne disease impacts are often linked to human modification of ecosystems as well as climate change. For tropical ecosystems, the health impacts of future environmental and developmental policy depend on how vector-borne disease risks trade off against other ecosystem services across heterogeneous landscapes. By linking future socio-economic and climate change pathways to dynamic land use models, this study is amongst the first to analyse and project impacts of both land use and climate change on continental-scale patterns in vector-borne diseases. Models were developed for cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis in the Americas D ecologically complex sand fly borne infections linked to tropical forests and diverse wild and domestic mammal hosts. Both diseases were hypothesised to increase with available interface habitat between forest and agricultural or domestic habitats and with mammal biodiversity. However, landscape edge metrics were not important as predictors of leishmaniasis. Models including mammal richness were similar in accuracy and predicted disease extent to models containing only climate and land use predictors. Overall, climatic factors explained 80% and land use factors only 20% of the variance in past disease patterns. Both diseases, but especially cutaneous leishmaniasis, were associated with low seasonality in temperature and precipitation. Since such seasonality increases under future climate change, particularly under strong climate forcing, both diseases were predicted to contract in geographical extent to 2050, with cutaneous leishmaniasis contracting by between 35% and 50%. Whilst visceral leishmaniasis contracted slightly more under strong than weak management for carbon, biodiversity and ecosystem services, future cutaneous leishmaniasis extent was relatively insensitive to future alternative socio-economic pathways. Models parameterised at narrower geographical scales may be more sensitive to land use pattern and project more substantial changes in disease extent under future alternative socio-economic pathways.

TI  - A ZOONOTIC FOCUS OF CUTANEOUS LEISHMANIASIS DUE TO LEISHMANIA-TROPICA AT UTUT, RIFT-VALLEY PROVINCE, KENYA
T2  - TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Several foci of cutaneous leishmaniasis have been identified in central Kenya and the Rift Valley. One of these was the Utut focus of Leishmania tropica on the floor of the Rift Valley between Gilgil and Elementaita, where intense transmission was detected. High infection and scar rates were detected among illegal charcoal burners in a previously uninhabited forest reserve on a lava flow containing numerous caves and rock crevices inhabited by sandflies and mammals which included hyraxes. Multiple lesions, predominantly in the head region, were common. 33% of cases occurred in people who had been less than one year in the area. Although most lesions healed within one or 2 years, some large, recrudescing lesions lasted several years.

TI  - Influence of Catastrophic Climatic Events and Human Waste on Vibrio Distribution in the Karnaphuli Estuary, Bangladesh
T2  - ECOHEALTH
AB  - Vibrios are bacteria of marine and estuarine origin that can cause human diseases, such as cholera, and also affect aquatic organisms. The impact of storm-driven changes in salinity and suspended particulate matter (SPM) on cultivable Vibrio counts (CVC) and distribution in Karnaphuli estuary, Bangladesh, was compared before and after a strong cyclone in mid May 2007 and after a monsoon landslide a month later. CVC were higher (similar to 10(3) colony forming units-cfu/ml) at estuary's mouth (salinity 20-15 parts per thousand, ppt) and steeply declined landwards. CVC and their proportion of total aerobic bacteria were highest after the cyclone and also increased after the landslide, likely due to higher SPM loads. The cyclone did not significantly change previous fecal coliform abundance, contrasting with the ten times increase after the landslide. Sewage input enhanced CVC near the point sources. CVC and salinity correlated highly significantly at salinities < 10 ppt; however, at higher values dispersion increased, probably due to the effect of sediment resuspension on CVC. Cyclone or heavy rainfall-mediated turbidity changes jointly with salinity gradients can significantly influence abundance and distribution of estuarine vibrios. Extended salt intrusion and higher turbidities in tropical estuaries by stronger and more frequent storms and deforestation-derived erosion could favor Vibrio growth, with increasing risks for aquatic resources and human health in the coastal zone.

TI  - Ecological transition from natural forest to tea plantations: effect on the dynamics of malaria vectors in the highlands of Cameroon
T2  - TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - From October 2002 to September 2003, an entomological survey was carried out in a rural forested fringed village in the highlands of Mount Cameroon region to determine the temporal dynamics of the anopheline population and the intensity of malaria transmission. A total of 2387 Anopheles spp. were collected, with A. funestus predominating (59.9%), followed by A. hancocki (24.4%) and A. gambiae s.l. (15.7%). Considerable differences were observed in the nocturnal biting cycles of parous mosquitoes, with peak activity in the latter part of the night. PCR revealed that all specimens of the A. funestus group were A. funestus s.s. and all specimens from the A. gambiae complex were A. gambiae s.s. of the S molecular form. Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite rates of 17.3% and 8.5% were recorded for A. funestus and A. hancocki, respectively, with an anthropophilic rate of 96.3%. A strong positive correlation (r=0.996) was found between the human-biting rate and the entomological inoculation rate (EIR). Malaria transmission was very high and perennial, with an estimated annual EIR of 460.1 infective bites per person per year. These results confirm that in high agricultural activity areas, A. funestus can be by far the major malaria vector responsible for malaria transmission.

TI  - Insect Herbivory and Leaf Disease in Natural and Human Disturbed Habitats: Lessons from Early-Successional Heliconia Herbs
T2  - BIOTROPICA
AB  - The interaction of plants with insect herbivores and fungal pathogens can affect community dynamics, but there is little information on how this antagonistic interaction may be altered in human-disturbed tropical systems. We examined whether the amount and quality of foliar damage on the pioneer herbs Heliconia latispatha and Heliconia collinsiana are distinct on road edges and secondary riparian vegetation compared with natural gaps in continuous forest (controls) in Mexico. We also investigated some physical and biological mechanisms that may jointly explain such differences. The overall insect damage in H. latispatha was similar between road edges and natural forest gaps (8.0% vs. 7.2% of leaf area). Damage by caterpillars, however, decreased from 4.2 percent in forest gaps to 0.5 percent on road edges, whereas damage by leaf-cutting ants increased from 0 to 5.8 percent. In secondary riparian vegetation, where none of the leaves sampled were attacked by ants, overall herbivore damage in H. collinsiana was less than half that observed in forest gaps (3.0% vs. 6.7%), and driven mainly by differences in caterpillar damage (2.5% vs. 6.2%). By contrast, attack by leaf fungal pathogens was two to three times greater in both human-disturbed habitats than in gaps (8.29.6% vs. 3.74.2%). Potential mechanisms underlying these differences involved human-induced shifts in air and soil temperature driven by greater light availability, as well as changes in relative humidity, leaf toughness, foliar condensed tannins, and local abundance of herbivores. Our results indicate that human disturbance alters insect herbivory and may increase proliferation of leaf disease.

TI  - Microhabitat Temperatures and Prevalence of the Pathogenic Fungus <i>Batrachochytrium</i> <i>dendrobatidis</i> in Lowland Amazonian Frogs
T2  - TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE
AB  - Until recently, it was assumed that the pathogenic fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) was not widely distributed in warm ecosystems such as lowland tropical rainforests because high environmental temperatures limit its growth. However, several studies have documented Bd infection in lowland rainforest amphibians over the past decade. In addition, a recent study focusing on museum-stored specimens showed that Bd has been present in the lowland Amazon for more than 80 years. These findings lent support to the idea that some lowland rainforest habitats offer suitable environmental conditions for Bd growth, even though most lowland areas may contain suboptimal conditions limiting the pathogen spread and growth. Here, we surveyed four sites in southeast Peru to examine the prevalence and the intensity of infection of Bd in lowland Amazonian amphibians and to fill a gap between two areas where Bd has been present for more than a decade. In one of these "hotspots" of Bd infection, the upper slopes of Manu National Park, several species experienced population declines attributed to Bd epizootics over the past 15 years. We also examined the thermal profile of the main microhabitats used by lowland Amazonian frogs to infer whether these microhabitats offer suitable thermal conditions for Bd growth. We detected Bd in nine lowland frog species and variation in prevalence of infection across years. Our findings suggest that the temperatures in the leaf litter and understory vegetation of some habitats offer suitable conditions for Bd growth.

TI  - Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment for the Rondo Dwarf Galago in Coastal Forests, Tanzania
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - Negative effects of climate change on organisms and their habitats pose significant conservation challenges especially for species already under siege from other threats like habitat loss, pollution and diseases. This study assessed the extent to which the Rondo dwarf galago (Paragalago rondoensis), an endangered primate in the coastal forests in eastern Tanzania is threatened by climate change. Past and projected temperature and precipitation records from Tanzania Meteorological Authority were overlaid with P. rondoensis distribution range to assess the species exposure to climate extremes. Traits predisposing it to climate change were also obtained from published literature and experts on the organism's biology to determine its sensitivity. The P. rondoensis vulnerability to climate change was obtained by feeding exposure and sensitivity data into Natureserve's Climate Change Vulnerability Index (CCVI) software. Results indicated that most of Rondo galago's habitat and distribution range will be exposed to a temperature increase of 1 to 1.3 degrees C by 2050, which if combined with other threats, is likely to further endanger the species survival. Due to its diet specialization on insects, which are moisture-dependent, any extreme decrease in humidity will reduce its diet availability thereby threatening the species further. Moreover, Rondo galago's limited habitats and distribution range in the East African tropical coastal forests, raises the species threat level. Rondo galago's conservation should be enhanced through creation of corridors to facilitate its possible shifts to conducive and safer habitats in the event of extreme weather. Climate change aspects should also be integrated into the species conservation strategies.

T2  - FLORIDA ENTOMOLOGIST
AB  - Approximately 6000 species of Thysanoptera have been described worldwide. They are particularly diverse in the Neotropics, living in a wide range of environments. Although many species of thrips are well known as inhabitants of cultivated plants, there are others that are abundant in other types of habitats. In the present study we conducted a survey in the "Biosphere Reserve of Volcan Tacana" with the main objective to know the native fauna of thrips. The results confirm the presence of 112 species in 52 genera and 4 families. Our survey indicates that this reserve contains a great biodiversity of Thysanoptera. A full check-list of species is provided.

TI  - Vegetation cover and biodiversity reduce parasite infection in wild hosts across ecological levels and scales
T2  - ECOGRAPHY
AB  - Land use changes and biodiversity loss critically disrupts ecosystem functioning and are major drivers of infectious disease outbreaks. Trypanosoma cruzi, the agent of Chagas disease, is a multi-host parasite whose epidemiology has changed due to the expansion of anthropogenic activities over natural areas. We aimed to understand the ecological processes increasing parasite prevalence at the individual, the community and the landscape levels using the largest database on small mammal infection by T. cruzi in Brazil. We applied machine learning techniques and structural equation models to show that allometric traits and the relative abundance of rodents in the community were important predictors of infection risk, followed by variables associated with the landscape environmental quality. Natural vegetation cover change and the taxonomic and functional dimensions of biodiversity indirectly reduced infection through its effect on the abundance distribution and composition of host communities. According to our findings, approaches to biodiversity conservation and restoration based on the integration of social inclusion and human welfare would contribute to regulate the prevalence of T. cruzi in wild hosts, which may reduce overall transmission risk.

TI  - The Emergence of Chikungunya ECSA Lineage in a Mayaro Endemic Region on the Southern Border of the Amazon Forest
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE
AB  - Anthropic changes on the edges of the tropical forests may facilitate the emergence of new viruses from the sylvatic environment and the simultaneous circulation of sylvatic and urban viruses in the human population. In this study, we investigated the presence of arboviruses (arthropod-borne viruses) in the sera of 354 patients, sampled from February 2014 to October 2018 in Sinop city. We sequenced the complete genomes of one chikungunya virus (CHIKV)-positive and one out of the 33 Mayaro virus (MAYV)-positive samples. The CHIKV genome obtained here belongs to the East/Central/South African (ECSA) genotype and the MAYV genome belongs to the L genotype. These genomes clustered with other viral strains from different Brazilian states, but the CHIKV strain circulating in Sinop did not cluster with other genomes from the Mato Grosso state, suggesting that at least two independent introductions of this virus occurred in Mato Grosso. Interestingly, the arrival of CHIKV in Sinop seems to not have caused a surge in human cases in the following years, as observed in the rest of the state, suggesting that cross immunity from MAYV infection might be protecting the population from CHIKV infection. These findings reinforce the need for continued genomic surveillance in order to evaluate how simultaneously circulating alphaviruses infecting the human population will unfold.

TI  - Factors that are associated with the risk of acquiring <i>Plasmodium knowlesi</i> malaria in Sabah, Malaysia: a case-control study protocol
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Introduction: Plasmodium knowlesi has long been present in Malaysia, and is now an emerging cause of zoonotic human malaria. Cases have been confirmed throughout South-East Asia where the ranges of its natural macaque hosts and Anopheles leucosphyrus group vectors overlap. The majority of cases are from Eastern Malaysia, with increasing total public health notifications despite a concurrent reduction in Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax malaria. The public health implications are concerning given P. knowlesi has the highest risk of severe and fatal disease of all Plasmodium spp in Malaysia. Current patterns of risk and disease vary based on vector type and competence, with individual exposure risks related to forest and forest-edge activities still poorly defined. Clustering of cases has not yet been systematically evaluated despite reports of peri-domestic transmission and known vector competence for human-to-human transmission.
   Methods and analysis: A population-based case-control study will be conducted over a 2-year period at two adjacent districts in north-west Sabah, Malaysia. Confirmed malaria cases presenting to the district hospital sites meeting relevant inclusion criteria will be requested to enrol. Three community controls matched to the same village as the case will be selected randomly. Study procedures will include blood sampling and administration of household and individual questionnaires to evaluate potential exposure risks associated with acquisition of P. knowlesi malaria. Secondary outcomes will include differences in exposure variables between P. knowlesi and other Plasmodium spp, risk of severe P. knowlesi malaria, and evaluation of P. knowlesi case clustering. Primary analysis will be per protocol, with adjusted ORs for exposure risks between cases and controls calculated using conditional multiple logistic regression models.
   Ethics: This study has been approved by the human research ethics committees of Malaysia, the Menzies School of Health Research, Australia, and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, UK.

TI  - ANTIBACTERIAL PROPERTY TESTING OF TWO SPECIES OF TROPICAL PLANT <i>LASIANTHUS</i> (RUBIACEAE)
T2  - SOUTHEAST ASIAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Two tropical plant species, Lasianthus pilosus and Lasianthus stipularis are used in traditional medicine but there have been no published studies of the extracts of these plants against bacteria. In this study, we aimed to determine the antimicrobial activities of the above two plants against two gram-positive and seven gram-negative bacterial strains to determine the potential of these two plant species for possible antimicrobial drug development. The antibacterial activities of the lipophilic extracts of these plants were evaluated by disk diffusion and broth microdilution methods. The zone diameters and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) for these plant extracts exhibited their highest antibacterial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, followed by Staphylococcus aureus and Acinetobacter baumannii, respectively. The MIC of these extracts against P. aeruginosa (ATCC 37166 and ATCC 27853) varied from 50 to 200 mu g/ml. Thin layer chromatography and detection using different specific reagents revealed the presence of terpenoids, phenolic compounds and iridoid. Cell lysis due to the effect of the lipophilic extracts of these tested plants was demonstrated using scanning electron microscopy. In conclusion, the bioactive compounds of these plants should be studied further to develop potential antimicrobial agents.

TI  - The fewer, the better fare: Can the loss of vegetation in the Cerrado drive the increase in dengue fever cases infection?
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Several studies have reported the relationship of deforestation with increased incidence of infectious diseases, mainly due to the deregulation caused in these environments. The purpose of this study was to answer the following questions: a) is increased loss of vegetation related to dengue cases in the Brazilian Cerrado? b) how do different regions of the tropical savanna biome present distinct patterns for total dengue cases and vegetation loss? c) what is the projection of a future scenario of deforestation and an increased number of dengue cases in 2030? Thus, this study aimed to assess the relationship between loss of native vegetation in the Cerrado and dengue infection. In this paper, we quantify the entire deforested area and dengue infection cases from 2001 to 2019. For data analyses, we used Poisson generalized linear model, descriptive statistics, cluster analysis, non-parametric statistics, and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models to predict loss of vegetation and fever dengue cases for the next decade. Cluster analysis revealed the formation of four clusters among the states. Our results showed significant increases in loss of native vegetation in all states, with the exception of Piaui. As for dengue cases, there were increases in the states of Minas Gerais, SAo Paulo, and Mato Grosso. Based on projections for 2030, Minas Gerais will register about 4,000 dengue cases per 100,000 inhabitants, Sao Paulo 750 dengue cases per 100,000 inhabitants, and Mato Grosso 500 dengue cases per 100,000 inhabitants. To reduce these projections, Brazil will need to control deforestation and implement public health, environmental and social policies, requiring a joint effort from all spheres of society.

TI  - Prevalence of hemoprotozoan parasites in small ruminants along a human-livestock-wildlife interface in western Uganda
T2  - VETERINARY PARASITOLOGY- REGIONAL STUDIES AND REPORTS
AB  - Small ruminants are important to community livelihood in developing countries; however information on the role of hemoprotozoan parasites is scanty. The objective of the study was to determine hemoprotozoan parasitic prevalence in western Uganda and identify major areas associated with these infections. This was a cross sectional study conducted at the edge of Budongo Conservation Forest in Masindi district of western Uganda in which 712 small ruminants were sampled. Blood from the jugular vein was collected from caprines and ovines and placed in an EDTA tube, and transported to the laboratory for examination. Thin and thick smears were prepared and examined by microscopy for hemoprotozoan parasites, and DNA was extracted and examined by PCR for Trypanosoma spp. A total of 13 villages in Budongo sub-county were surveyed and the study showed that caprines were the major small ruminants of importance to the community. Prevalence of hemoprotozoan parasites was as follows; anaplasmosis (3.65%) > theileriosis (0.45%) > trypanosomiasis (0.15%) and babesiosis (0%) by microscopy. Infections were found in the young with the exception of Anaplasma spp. while coinfections of anaplasmosis and theileriosis were high. Molecular analysis showed an overall trypanosome prevalence of 9.27% (PCR), mainly due to Trypanosoma brucei and T. congolense forest. Villages with trypanosomiasis were found in lowlands and swamps. The current trypanosomiasis prevalence in small ruminants of Uganda was 10 times greater than that previously reported showing that the disease burden has increased overtime within Uganda. A prevalence of 0.14% (95% CI: 0.00, 0.78) for the SRA gene showed that small ruminants would be important reservoirs of infection to humans. Hemoprotozoan parasites are a threat to community livelihood in developing countries and the role of molecular diagnostic techniques in disease monitoring was re-emphasized by this study. Information on primary hosts involved in the propagation of hemoprotozoan parasites in Uganda would help streamline prospective disease surveillance and control efforts.

AB  - Background: In areas where health resources are limited, community participation in the recognition and reporting of disease hazards is critical for the identification of outbreaks. This is particularly true for zoonotic diseases such as monkeypox that principally affect people living in remote areas with few health services. Here we report the findings of an evaluation measuring the effectiveness of a film-based community outreach program designed to improve the understanding of monkeypox symptoms, transmission and prevention, by residents of the Republic of the Congo (ROC) who are at risk for disease acquisition.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: During 90 days, monkeypox outreach was conducted for similar to 23,860 people in northern ROC. Two hundred seventy-one attendees (selected via a structured sample) were interviewed before and after participating in a small-group outreach session. The proportion of interviewees demonstrating monkeypox-specific knowledge before and after was compared. Significant gains were measured in areas of disease recognition, transmission, and mitigation of risk. The ability to recognize at least one disease symptom and a willingness to take a family member with monkeypox to the hospital increased from 49 and 45% to 95 and 87%, respectively (p<0.001, both). Willingness to deter behaviors associated with zoonotic risk, such as eating the carcass of a primate found dead in the forest, remained fundamentally unchanged however, suggesting additional messaging may be needed.
   Conclusions/Significance: These results suggest that our current program of film-based educational activities is effective in improving disease-specific knowledge and may encourage individuals to seek out the advice of health workers when monkeypox is suspected.

TI  - Discrimination of liana and tree leaves from a Neotropical Dry Forest using visible-near infrared and longwave infrared reflectance spectra
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Increases in liana abundance in tropical forests are pervasive threats to the current and future forest carbon stocks. Never before has the need been more evident for new approaches to detect the presence of liana in ecosystems, given their significance as fingerprints of global environmental change. In this study, we explore the use of longwave infrared reflectance (LWIR, 8-11 mu m) as a wavelength region for the classification of liana and tree leaves and compare classification results with those obtained using visible-near infrared reflectance data (VIS-NIR, 0.45-0.95 mu m). Twenty sun leaves were collected from each of 14 liana species and 21 tree species located at the canopy or forest edge (n = 700) in Santa Rosa National Park, Costa Rica. LWIR and VIS-NIR reflectance measurements were performed on these leaves using a portable calibrated Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) Agilent ExoScan 4100 and a UniSpec spectral analysis system, respectively. The VIS-NIR and LWIR data were first resampled. Then these two spectral libraries were pre-processed for noise reduction and spectral feature enhancement resulting in three datasets for each spectral region as follows: filtered only, filtered followed by extraction of the first derivative, and continuous wavelet transformation (CWT). Data reduction was then applied to these data sets using principal components analysis (PCA). The outputs obtained from the PCA were used to conduct the supervised classification of liana and tree leaves. In total, 21 classifiers were applied to datasets of training and testing to extract the classification accuracy and agreement for liana and tree leaves. The results suggest that the classification of leaves based on LWIR data can reach accuracy values between 66 and 96% and agreement values between 32 and 92%, regardless of the type of classifier. In contrast, the classification based on VIS-NIR data shows accuracy values between 50 and 70% and agreement values between 0.01 and 40%. The highest classification rates of liana and tree leaves were obtained from datasets pre-processed using the CWT or from the extraction of the first derivative and classified using either random forest, k-nearest neighbor, or support vector machine with radial kernel. The results using the LWIR reflectance highlight the potential of this spectral region for the accurate detection of liana extent in tropical ecosystems. Future studies should consider this potential and test the regional monitoring of lianas.

TI  - Seasonality, richness and prevalence of intestinal parasites of three neotropical primates (<i>Alouatta seniculus</i>, <i>Ateles hybridus</i> and <i>Cebus versicolor</i>) in a fragmented forest in Colombia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY-PARASITES AND WILDLIFE
AB  - Studies on parasites infecting non-human primates are essential to better understand the potential threat to humans of zoonoses transmission, particularly under the current processes of pervasive land use change and biodiversity loss. The natural ecosystems in the Middle Magdalena river basin in Colombia have suffered a dramatic reduction and transformation into pastures and agroindustrial monocultures, threatening their biodiversity, and probably affecting the dynamics between parasites and their hosts, as well as altering the disease transmission cycles between wild populations and humans. This study evaluated seasonality, prevalence and richness of intestinal parasites in three species of neotropical primates: Cebus versicolor, Ateles hybridus and Alouatta seniculus, in a fragmented forest in the Middle Magdalena river valley, Colombia. One hundred and eighty five faecal samples were collected between 2010 and 2015. Direct faecal smears were performed with saline solution (0.85%) and iodine solution (1%), in order to identify larvae and eggs based on their morphology. A large proportion of the samples examined (72.9%) was positive for intestinal parasites; seven families of nematodes were identified: Trichuridae, Trichostrongylidae, Oxyuridae, Strongyloididae, Ancylostomatidae, Ascarididae and Gnathostomatidae, two of protozoans: Entamoebidae and Balantiididae, as well as some eggs of trematodes, cestodes and acanthocephalans. Additionally, DNA extraction and sequencing were conducted on 30 faecal samples in order to identify Giardia sp. and Blastocystis hominis, two parasite species also present in humans. Molecular testing for Giardia sp. was negative and Blastocystis hominis was identified in a single sample of Alouatta seniculus. No clear patterns were observed for prevalence of intestinal parasites according to the season; nonetheless, parasite species richness was higher during the dry season. This study builds on our current understanding of intestinal parasites infecting wild neotropical primates and provides novel information on the patterns of intestinal parasites in primate communities exposed to anthropogenic disturbance.

TI  - The legendary lost city "Ciudad Blanca" found under tropical forest in Honduras, using ERS-2 and JERS-1 SAR imagery
T2  - EARTH SURFACE REMOTE SENSING II
CP  - Conference on Earth Surface Remote Sensing II
AB  - The legendary "Ciudad Blanca" of Honduras was first referred to under the name Xucutaco by the Spanish conquistador Hernan Cortes already in 1526. Located in the remote, impenetrable and incompletely mapped rainforest of the Mosquito Coast, it was never conquered by the Spanish. With the time, it was slowly abandoned and forgotten.
   Two JERS-1 and one ERS-2 SLC Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images have been used to identify and to locate the lost city, a task made difficult due to the thick vegetation cover. To this end, advanced processing tools for the detection of artificial targets under forest cover, and for SAR data fusion have been used.
   Among the techniques used, a new Bayesian Distribution Entropy Maximum A Posteriori (DE-MAP) vector speckle filter, particularly suited for the restoration of a strongly textured scene, has been used to enhance the SAR images. This new speckle filter incorporates a statistical description of the effects of the SAR imaging system: in order to account for the effects due to the spatial correlation of the speckle in SAR images, an estimator originating from the local spatial autocorrelation function (ACF) of the SAR signal are incorporated to this filter, to refine the evaluation of the non-stationary first order local statistics, to improve the restoration of the scene textural properties, and to preserve the useful spatial resolution in the speckle filtered image.
   On the other hand, radargrammetric techniques have been used to: i) produce a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of the study area; ii) fuse ERS and JERS information in order to allow visual identification of the remnants of Ciudad Blanca by visual photo-interpretation.
   Using the processed images, geocoded UTM spatio-maps of the region have also been produced to locate accurately our findings, and guide a ground expedition in the future.

TI  - Characterisation of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Matara district, southern Sri Lanka: evidence for case clustering
T2  - PATHOGENS AND GLOBAL HEALTH
AB  - Leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease transmitted by Phlebotomus spp. sand flies. Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) in Sri Lanka is caused by Leishmania donovani. Transmission patterns are different in Southern and Northern Sri Lanka. Current study examined the prevalence, risk factors and distribution of CL in Matara District, Southern Sri Lanka. Total of 2260 individuals from four District Secretariat divisions (DSDs) were screened by house to house surveys using an interviewer administered questionnaire. The study population had an age range of 1-90 years (median = 43 +/- 17.31), low monthly income (<20 000 LKR, 52.8%) and a male to female ratio of 1 : 2. Thirty eight patients were diagnosed by light microscopy, culture and/or PCR with a disease prevalence of 1.68%. Spatial mapping provided evidence for significant case clustering, which tended to be more prominent with proximity to forest areas. The risk factors identified were un-plastered brick walls, absence or low usage of protective measures against insect bites, low income and excessive time (>4 hours/day) spent outdoors. However, exposure of limbs while outdoors, unawareness about the disease, type of occupation, common water source as the mode of water supply and presence of animal shelters within 200 m were not associated with the risk of acquiring the disease. Peri-domestic transmission is likely to contribute to the observed case clustering with all age groups at risk of acquiring the infection. Human behavioural habits coinciding with that of the vector, sand fly are likely to enable host-vector contact promoting its spread. Appropriate vector control measures, improvement of housing conditions, public education regarding preventive measures are required to contain the spread of disease.

TI  - Age-specific mortality analysis of the dry forest kissing bug, <i>Rhodnius neglectus</i>
T2  - ENTOMOLOGIA EXPERIMENTALIS ET APPLICATA
AB  - Age-specific mortality patterns can be very different across insects with different life histories. Some holometabolous insects (like mosquitoes, fruit flies) show a pattern where mortality rate decelerates at older ages, whereas other holometabolous insects (bruchid beetles) and hemimetabolous insects (cotton stainers, milkweed bugs, and kissing bugs) show an age-specific mortality pattern that increases through all ages. Kissing bugs are strictly hematophagous and are vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi Chagas, the etiologic agent of Chagas disease. Here, we tested whether cohort data from the dry forest kissing bug, Rhodnius neglectus Lent (Hemiptera: Reduviidae), supports an increase of mortality rate that decelerates with age. We analyzed the age-specific mortality pattern of a cohort of 250 individuals of R. neglectus. We used a suite of seven models with different degrees of complexity, to model age-dependent forms of change in mortality rate increase in R. neglectus in the laboratory. We used the Akaike model selection criterion to choose between models that consider absence or presence of mortality deceleration. Five of the seven models (logistic, Gavrilovs, Gompertz, DeMoivre, and exponential) showed a statistically significant fit to the mortality rate. Weak late-age mortality deceleration in R. neglectus was supported by the best fit (logistic model), and this result is consistent with predictions of the disposable soma theory of senescence.

TI  - Infection of Rodents by <i>Orientia tsutsugamushi</i>, the Agent of Scrub Typhus, in Relation to Land Use in Thailand
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE
AB  - The relationship between land use structures and occurrence of the scrub typhus agent, Orientia tsutsugamushi, in small wild mammals was investigated in three provinces of Thailand: Buriram, Loei, and Nan. O. tsutsugamushi detection was performed using 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) amplicon sequencing approach using Miseq Illumina platform. In total, 387 animals (rodents and shrews) were examined for the infection. The 16S rDNA sequences of the bacterium were found in nine animals, namely Bandicota savilei, Berylmys bowersi, Leopoldamys edwardsi, Rattus exulans, R. tanezumi, and Rattus sp. phylogenetic clade 3, yielding 2.3% infection rate, with two new rodent species found infected by the bacterium in Thailand: B. bowersi and L. edwardsi. Using a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) and Random Forest analyses for investigating the association between human-land use and occurrence of the bacterium, forest habitat appeared as a strong explicative variable of rodent infection, meaning that O. tsutsugamushi-infected animals were more likely found in forest-covered habitats. In terms of public health implementation, our results suggest that heterogenous forested areas including forest-converted agricultural land, reforestation areas, or fallows, are potential habitats for O. tsutsugamushi transmission. Further understanding of population dynamics of the vectors and their hosts in these habitats could be beneficial for the prevention of this neglected zoonotic disease.

TI  - 1ST REGULAR OBSERVATIONS ON LEAFHOPPERS, CICADULINA SPP VECTORS OF MAIZE STREAK VIRUS (MSV) IN SOUTHEASTERN NIGERIA
T2  - INSECT SCIENCE AND ITS APPLICATION
CP  - 2ND INTERNATIONAL CONF ON TROPICAL ENTOMOLOGY : BIO-CONTROL IN THE TROPICS
AB  - Regular field surveys were carried out in 2 week intervals in 1986 and 1987 to determine population density, species composition, migration activity of Cicadulina leafhoppers and their infectivity with maize streak virus (MSV) in different ecological locations of southeastern Nigeria: mangrove swamp forest (IITA and RIART station at Onne), deltaic swamp forest (RSUST, Port Harcourt), seasonal swamp forest (Iriebe) and high forest zone (NCRI, Amakama near Umuahia).
   Population density was always low during dry season, significantly lower in the rain forest zone and higher in the swamp forest, rapidly rising in the second rainy season in all ecological zones and reaching its maximum before the rains finally stopped. Sharp increase in the population density in Nov. and Dec. may indicate mass migration activity of Cicadulina leafhoppers from already dry areas of adjacent Guinea savanna at that period.
   Six species of Cicadulina were collected from most of sampled areas. C. ghaurii was the predominant species in 1986 and 1987, averaging 55.9% for all locations and periods. Its portion was higher in the mangrove swamp forest (Onne) than in the high forest zone (Amakama). The predominance of other species declined in the order: C. triangula (18.2%), C. mbila (17.2%), C. arachidis (5.9%), C. similis (2.8%) and C. hartmansi (0.1%). In absolute values, the portion of individuals out of the total number of leafhoppers collected was for C. triangula 53.7%, C. ghaurii 25.5%, C. mbila 17.3%, C. arachidis 2.3%, C. similis 1.1% and C. hartmansi 0.1%. A high population of C. triangula occurred only in the relatively short period in Nov.-Dec., especially in Iriebe and was correlated with the rapid increase of Cicadulina densities in all sampled areas; a high migration activity of C. triangula and C. mbila was confirmed.
   Incidence of MSV in the surveyed farmers' field varied between 0-22% in the first rainy season (1987) and 12-25% in the second rainy season (1986). The portion of Cicadulina adults already infected with MSV under field conditions and capable of transmitting MSV to the susceptible maize seedlings varied from 3.3 to 23.3%, with higher values for leafhoppers collected at the end of the second rainy season.

TI  - Domestic dogs in Atlantic forest preserves of south-eastern Brazil: a camera-trapping study on patterns of entrance and site occupancy rates
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY
AB  - Presence of exotic species in forest remnants is a major concern for the conservation of wild species, not only, on islands. where potential impact is higher. Although the problem is widespread and increasing, there are few studies on Neotropical forests. Here we quantify the Occurrence of domestic dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) in an Atlantic forest reserve in south-eastern Brazil (Santa Lucia Biological Station - SLBS). Throughout two years of monitoring with camera traps (2,142 camera-days), 25 records of 16 individual dogs were obtained in the interior of SLBS, making dogs the fourth most frequently, recorded species of mammals in general and the first-ranking among Carnivora, ahead of the ocelot and puma, the top two terrestrial predators present in SLBS. Dogs entered the forest year round, in almost half of the sampled months (48%), and predominantly during daytime (89%). They were detected in various. trails inside the reserve, but mostly in areas nearest to the reserve's border (< 200 in from the edge). Record rates of domestic dogs did not correlate significantly with climate variables, with frequency of mammal records and richness in general. or with any particular mammal species (Spearman rank correlation. p > 0.05 in all Cases), suggesting an erratic, non-seasonal pattern of entrance in the reserve. Data indicate that domestic dogs call be abundant and frequent visitors to little disturbed Atlantic forest reserves even when these are located in regions of low density of human population. The potential impact to native fauna is discussed.

TI  - Epidemiological, prevention and control updates of yellow fever outbreak in Brazil
T2  - ASIAN PACIFIC JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE
AB  - Yellow fever is an acute viral disease endemic to tropical countries, like Brazil, where, since the 1940s, has no significant documented outbreaks similar to that observed between 2016/2018 (2 045 confirmed cases and 677 deaths; caused by the sylvatic form). The principal manipulating factors inciting this change were absence of appropriate vaccination campaigns and increased urbanization population growth in forest areas, with prevalence of the virus in the species inhabiting of these areas. The 2016/2018 outbreaks exhibited incidence in areas with historically low or no yellow fever virus activity, triggering a surge in recorded deaths - mainly in the Southeastern states of Brazil. The Brazilian government aggressively responded, reforming the countries' prophylactic measures, including vaccine implementation - as of March, 2018, switching from the former double dose regimen of the vaccine, to a single dose protocol, deemed as adequate. Moreover, some states appropriated the fractionated dosage (1/5 of the standard dose), in foresight of potential vaccine shortages. To prevent the uprising of new sylvatic yellow fever cases in Brazil, it's obligatory the development of effective combative plans, including adaptation of prophylactic measures individually (use of repellents, protective clothing etc.), applicable vaccination campaigns in every endemic region, to raise awareness to locals and visitors alike. Notwithstanding these preventative strategies, the persistence of cases and the recent outbreaks in Brazil, highlight the possible ineffectiveness of combative measures. Based on these considerations, the objective of this review was to raise more awareness of the epidemiological impact of the disease in Brazil.

TI  - Predicting the distribution of the amphibian pathogen <i>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</i> in the New World
T2  - BIOTROPICA
AB  - One application of ecological niche modeling is predicting suitable areas for the establishment of invasive species. Herein, I model the fundamental niche of the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, a Pathogen linked to amphibian declines on several continents. Niche models were generated with the Genetic Algorithm of Rule-Set Prediction using point distribution data of the pathogen and digital maps of environmental variables integrated in a GIS environment. The distribution of regions suitable for B. dendrobatidis in the New World is extensive and includes significant portions of. (1) Sierra Madre Occidental pine-oak forest; (2) Sonoran and Sinaloan dry forest; (3) Veracruz moist forest; (4) Central America east from the Isthmus of Tehuantepec; (5) Caribbean Islands; (6) temperate forest in Chile and western Argentina south of latitude 30 degrees S; (7) Andes above 1000 m of attitude in Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador; (8) eastern slopes of the Andes in Peru and Bolivia; (9) Brazilian Atlantic forest; (10) Uruguay, Paraguay, and northeastern Argentina; (11) southwestern and Madeira-Tapajos Amazonian tropical rainforests. The regions with the highest suitability for B. dendrobatidis include habitats that contain the world's most diverse amphibian faunas. Models were built with New World localities, but also showed strong predictability for B. dendrobatidis localities in the Old World. Out of a total of 59 reported Old World localities for B. dendrobatidis, 56 occurred within regions with high predicted suitability. I also present analyses of the environmental envelope of B. dendrobatidis and discuss the implications of the results for the conservation of amphibians in the neotropics.

TI  - Peridomestic <i>Aedes malayensis</i> and <i>Aedes albopictus</i> are capable vectors of arboviruses in cities
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   Dengue and chikungunya are global re-emerging mosquito-borne diseases. In Singapore, sustained vector control coupled with household improvements reduced domestic mosquito populations for the past 45 years, particularly the primary vector Aedes aegypti. However, while disease incidence was low for the first 30 years following vector control implementation, outbreaks have re-emerged in the past 15 years. Epidemiological observations point to the importance of peridomestic infection in areas not targeted by control programs. We investigated the role of vectors in peri-domestic areas.
   Methods
   We carried out entomological surveys to identify the Aedes species present in vegetated sites in highly populated areas and determine whether mosquitoes were present in open-air areas frequented by people. We compared vector competence of Aedes albopictus and Aedes malayensis with Ae. aegypti after oral infection with sympatric dengue serotype 2 and chikungunya viruses. Mosquito saliva was tested for the presence of infectious virus particles as a surrogate for transmission following oral infection.
   Results
   We identified Aedes albopictus and Aedes malayensis throughout Singapore and quantified their presence in forested and opened grassy areas. Both Ae. albopictus and Ae. malayensis can occupy sylvatic niches and were highly susceptible to both arboviruses. A majority of saliva of infected Ae. malayensis contained infectious particles for both viruses.
   Conclusions
   Our study reveals the prevalence of competent vectors in peri-domestic areas, including Ae.malayensis for which we established the vector status. Epidemics can be driven by infection foci, which are epidemiologically enhanced in the context of low herd immunity, selective pressure on arbovirus transmission and the presence of infectious asymptomatic persons, all these conditions being present in Singapore. Learning from Singapore's vector control success that reduced domestic vector populations, but has not sustainably reduced arboviral incidence, we suggest including peri-domestic vectors in the scope of vector management.

TI  - Dispersal patterns of <i>Trypanosoma cruzi</i> in Arequipa, Peru
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Anthropogenic environmental alterations such as urbanization can threaten native populations as well as create novel environments that allow human pests and pathogens to thrive. As the number and size of urban environments increase globally, it is more important than ever to understand the dispersal dynamics of hosts, vectors and pathogens of zoonotic disease systems. For example, a protozoan parasite and the causative agent of Chagas disease in humans, Trypanosoma cruzi, recently colonized and spread through the city of Arequipa, Peru. We used population genomic and phylogenomic tools to analyze whole genomes of 123 T. cruzi isolates derived from vectors and non-human mammals throughout Arequipa to determine patterns of T. cruzi dispersal. The data show significant population genetic structure within city blocks-parasites in the same block tend to be very closely related-but no population structure among blocks within districts-parasites in neighboring blocks are no more closely related to one another than to parasites in distant districts. These data suggest that T. cruzi dispersal within a block occurs regularly and that occasional long-range dispersal events allow the establishment of new T. cruzi populations in distant blocks. Movement of domestic animals may be the primary mechanism of inter-block and inter-district T. cruzi dispersal.
   Author summary
   Urbanization creates environments that are ideal for some human pests and pathogens. As the number and size of urban environments increases globally, it is becoming vital to understand how human disease-causing pathogens, their vectors, and their non-human hosts disperse through urban landscapes. Here we study a population of Trypanosoma cruzi-the protozoan parasite and causative agent of Chagas disease in humans-that recently colonized the city of Arequipa, Peru. We use population genomic and phylogenomic tools to understand how this parasite population dispersed through the city to achieve its current distribution and abundance. We show that T. cruzi collected from the same city block tend to be very closely related, while those from neighboring blocks are often as distantly related as those from blocks in distant districts. The data suggest that vectors facilitate frequent within-block dispersal of the parasite, while domestic animal movement may facilitate the relatively infrequent inter-block and inter-district dispersal.

TI  - Intestinal parasitism and nutritional status among indigenous children from the Argentinian Atlantic Forest: Determinants of enteroparasites infections in minority populations
T2  - ACTA TROPICA
AB  - Objective: Intestinal parasitoses, especially in the less favored populations of tropical and subtropical areas, are a scourge of high impact in public health. We conducted a cross-sectional survey to investigate the prevalence of helminths and protozoa pathogens, malnutrition, and their determinants in children from indigenous Mbya Guarani villages of Iguazti, in the subtropical Atlantic Forest of Argentina.
   Methods: Parasitological assessment was performed using a combination of flotation, sedimentation, and centrifugation techniques, as well as temporal and permanent stains. Nutritional assessment was based on nutritional indicators derived from anthropometric measurements. Statistical analysis of socio-demographic determinants was assessed by Generalized Linear Mixed Models at individual, household, and village levels.
   Results: A total of 303 children from 140 families from Fortin Mborore and Yriapu Jungle villages participated, and 87.8% of them resulted positive to at least one parasite. Multiparasitism reached 70% and children with up to six different parasites were detected. Thirteen genera were identified, of which eight were pathogenic. The most frequent soil-transmitted helminths were hookworms and Strongyloides stercoralis with 60.7 and 41.9%, respectively. Enterobius vermicularis was detected in 28.4% of children. Giardia duodenalis was the main protozoan and reached the 33.3%. The prevalence of stunting and underweight were 38.9% and 6.9%, whereas for overweight and obesity were 28.1% and 12.9%, respectively. An association was observed between stunting in older children and the presence of parasites, multiparasitism, and giardiasis. Individual conditions and habits were important determinants for most of the parasitoses.
   Conclusions: We evidenced that the community is affected by the double burden of malnutrition and parasitoses. To face this alarming situation, public policies are needed to improve sanitation, hygiene education access, community deworming programs, and quality nutrition on a regular basis of intercultural approaches.

TI  - ECOLOGICAL NICHE MODELING OF <i>RICKETTSIA</i>-INFECTED AND -UNINFECTED TICKS IN FOREST EDGES OF THAILAND
T2  - SOUTHEAST ASIAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Rickettsia spp are the causative agents of rickettsia infection in humans and animals. In Thailand, many Rickettsia spp with unknown pathogenicity have been detected in ticks, but the demographic and geographic distributions of their Rickettsia infection status remain largely unknown. Here, an ecological niche model based on maximum entropy method was constructed using a maximum entropy program to determine environmental factors and probability of occurrence and distribution of Rickettsia-infected ticks based on 38 environmental raster layers. The ecological niche model predicted that optimal Rickettsia-infected tick occurrence was during a season with low precipitation and high temperature and an elevation of <1,400 m. In addition, highest frequency of infected ticks was predicted to be found in along the Thai-Cambodia border at the lower region of northeastern Thailand. The predictions were statistically concordant with data collected from forest edges adjacent to residential areas in 33 remote districts of Thailand between 2008-2011. The study should provide baseline information which should assist in future development of surveillance and prevention programs for tick-borne rickettsioses in humans, especially in remote areas where diagnosis is not available and late responses frequently occur.

TI  - Socioeconomic, demographic and landscape factors associated with cutaneous leishmaniasis in Kurunegala District, Sri Lanka
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
AB  - Background Leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease that affects countries in the developing world. In Sri Lanka, cutaneous leishmaniasis is the most common form of the disease. It is prevalent in dry and intermediate zones, mostly associated with rural settings. Understanding basic risk factors is critical in the management of the disease with effective interventions. This study is focused on assessing the demographic, socioeconomic and landscape factors associated with leishmaniasis in Kurunegala District, Sri Lanka. Methods A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted. Households of the past patients and randomly selected households, which had no history of leishmaniasis cases were interviewed. The clinical, socioeconomic, demographic, landscape and awareness-related data were obtained using a pre-tested, interviewer-administered questionnaire. Results A total of 101 patients and a similar number of controls were included in the study. All the patients had the cutaneous form of the disease. Housewives and personnel with monthly incomes less than Rs. 10,000 (56.76 USD) were 3.9- and 9.5-times more prone to the disease, respectively, according to multivariate analysis. Presence of decaying garbage, termite hills, unclear areas, wet soil and gardening areas were always associated with the increased odds of acquiring the disease. Conclusions Demographic factors do not play a pivotal role in the prevalence of leishmaniasis in the area. Housewives, inhabitants with low incomes and individuals who live in areas with conditions suitable for sand fly breeding and resting are major groups with a higher risk of infection. Special attention must be given in raising awareness and environmental management in control activities.

TI  - Landscape Diversity Related to Buruli Ulcer Disease in Cote d'Ivoire
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background: Buruli ulcer disease (BU), due to the bacteria Mycobacterium ulcerans, represents an important and emerging public health problem, especially in many African countries. Few elements are known nowadays about the routes of transmission of this environmental bacterium to the human population.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: In this study, we have investigated the relationships between the incidence of BU in Cote d'Ivoire, western Africa, and a group of environmental variables. These environmental variables concern vegetation, crops (rice and banana), dams, and lakes. Using a geographical information system and multivariate analyses, we show a link between cases of BU and different environmental factors for the first time on a country-wide scale. As a result, irrigated rice field cultures areas, and, to a lesser extent, banana fields as well as areas in the vicinity of dams used for irrigation and aquaculture purposes, represent high-risk zones for the human population to contract BU in Cote d'Ivoire. This is much more relevant in the central part of the country.
   Conclusions/Significance: As already suspected by several case-control studies in different African countries, we strengthen in this work the identification of high-risk areas of BU on a national spatial scale. This first study should now be followed by many others in other countries and at a multi-year temporal scale. This goal implies a strong improvement in data collection and sharing in order to achieve to a global picture of the environmental conditions that drive BU emergence and persistence in human populations.

TI  - Seed predation, pathogens and germination in primary vs. secondary cloud forest at Maquipucuna Reserve, Ecuador
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY
AB  - Because the fate of the seed rain has long been shown to be critical to understanding forest recruitment and regeneration, seed predation, seed pathogens and germination among different species was examined in primary (closed-canopy vs. tree-fall gap) and in secondary (banana vs. sugarcane vs. seeded pasture) cloud forest at Maquipucuna Reserve, Ecuador. I found (1) seed predation took more seeds than either seed pathogenic disease or germination for all tree seed species and in both forests, where the level of seed loss to predation was greatest in the closed-canopy primary forest, second largest in the tree-fall gaps and less in recovering banana, sugarcane and pasture; (2) for pathogens these trends were reversed; and (3) most seeds, that were not taken by predators or pathogens, germinated. Cecropia sp. seeds in the tree-fall gaps and Otoba gordoniifolia seeds in both closed-canopy forest and tree-fall gaps were the most significantly different among all treatments in primary forest and Solanum ovalifolia seeds in banana fields and Piper aduncum in all fields were the most significantly different among all treatments in secondary forest. I conclude that forests may recover faster after human disturbance (here agriculture) than after natural disturbances (here tree-fall).

TI  - Recasting the theory of mosquito-borne pathogen transmission dynamics and control
T2  - TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Mosquito-borne diseases pose some of the greatest challenges in public health, especially in tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world. Efforts to control these diseases have been underpinned by a theoretical framework developed for malaria by Ross and Macdonald, including models, metrics for measuring transmission, and theory of control that identifies key vulnerabilities in the transmission cycle. That framework, especially Macdonalds formula for R-0 and its entomological derivative, vectorial capacity, are now used to study dynamics and design interventions for many mosquito-borne diseases. A systematic review of 388 models published between 1970 and 2010 found that the vast majority adopted the RossMacdonald assumption of homogeneous transmission in a well-mixed population. Studies comparing models and data question these assumptions and point to the capacity to model heterogeneous, focal transmission as the most important but relatively unexplored component in current theory. Fine-scale heterogeneity causes transmission dynamics to be nonlinear, and poses problems for modeling, epidemiology and measurement. Novel mathematical approaches show how heterogeneity arises from the biology and the landscape on which the processes of mosquito biting and pathogen transmission unfold. Emerging theory focuses attention on the ecological and social context for mosquito blood feeding, the movement of both hosts and mosquitoes, and the relevant spatial scales for measuring transmission and for modeling dynamics and control.

TI  - Enhancing vector refractoriness to trypanosome infection: achievements, challenges and perspectives
T2  - BMC MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - With the absence of effective prophylactic vaccines and drugs against African trypanosomosis, control of this group of zoonotic neglected tropical diseases depends the control of the tsetse fly vector. When applied in an area-wide insect pest management approach, the sterile insect technique (SIT) is effective in eliminating single tsetse species from isolated populations. The need to enhance the effectiveness of SIT led to the concept of investigating tsetse-trypanosome interactions by a consortium of researchers in a five-year (2013-2018) Coordinated Research Project (CRP) organized by the Joint Division of FAO/IAEA. The goal of this CRP was to elucidate tsetse-symbiome-pathogen molecular interactions to improve SIT and SIT-compatible interventions for trypanosomoses control by enhancing vector refractoriness. This would allow extension of SIT into areas with potential disease transmission. This paper highlights the CRP's major achievements and discusses the science-based perspectives for successful mitigation or eradication of African trypanosomosis.

TI  - Sources and Targets for Drug Repurposing: Landscaping Transitions in Therapeutic Space
T2  - ASSAY AND DRUG DEVELOPMENT TECHNOLOGIES
AB  - Patent applications provide unique opportunities for landscaping ongoing medical innovation. In this analysis of drug repurposing patent applications published under the international Patent Convention Treaty during the years 2011-2014, we discuss what categories in the World Health Organization's International Classification of Diseases provide drugs and drug candidates for potential second medical uses, and how these proposed repurposed uses relate to each other and the original ones. Also discussed are the geographic origin of the patent assignees and their type and size. Beyond the expected interactions within the field of neuropsychiatry, frequent secondary use claims for oncology compounds to treat noninfectious respiratory diseases, and for cardiovascular compounds to treat neurological conditions, were unexpected findings derived from the repurposing heatmap. The relative absence of repurposing claims to treat parasitic or tropical diseases contrasts sharply with the broad attention this segment receives in the peer-reviewed literature. Equally notable are the dominance of universities and small pharmaceutical companies; a focus of large multinational companies to repurpose their own compounds; and the leading role of European-centered entities among the assignees. We believe that this investigation represents the first comprehensive cross-sectional attempt at mapping drug repurposing patterns across therapeutic fields, and could provide important clues that complement those obtained from the peer-reviewed literature.

TI  - Sand fly (<i>Lutzomyia vexator</i>) (Diptera: Psychodidae) Populations in upstate New York:: Abundance, microhabitat, and phenology
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - Visceral leishmaniasis is an endemic protozoal disease of humans and dogs in tropical and subtropical regions in Asia, Africa, southern Europe, Central America, and South America, where sand flies (genera Phlebotomus and Lutzomyia) act as vectors. An outbreak in a New York foxhound kennel and subsequent surveillance revealed widespread Leishmania infantum infection of dogs in the United States, outside the known range of the vector sand flies. For this study, we conducted surveillance for sand flies during the summers of 2001 and 2002 at two areas: on the grounds of the New York kennel and at the Institute of Ecosystem Studies (IES) 10 km away. CO2-baited light traps were used for surveillance. Populations of Lutzomyia vexator, not previously known in New York, were widespread and locally abundant (range, 0.26-1.16 flies/trap night) at the IES site. These populations showed a bimodal, midsummer activity peak and were most abundant on steep slopes within mature mixed hardwood forests. Further research will be necessary to determine whether the New York populations of L. vexator in the vicinity of the kennel could be involved in transmission of canine leishmaniasis.

AB  - The lack of sustainability in the exploitation of the tropical Amazon forest has caused severely impacted environment and biodiversity. In this context, the objective of this study is to detect, characterize and quantify the forest areas affected by timber exploitation in the years 2001 and 2002. This research was developed in the north of the Mato Grosso state, Brazil, utilizing fraction images that were generated by a linear spectral mixture model referring to the mentioned years. Change vector analysis (CVA) was applied to the difference image of the fraction images from the two years. One image representing magnitude of change, and two images representing the angles of the change vectors were generated. These images are efficient for detection of intensity and type of change that occurred in the forested areas, which are subject to selective logging.

TI  - An Unexpected Recurrent Transmission of Rift Valley Fever Virus in Cattle in a Temperate and Mountainous Area of Madagascar
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Rift Valley fever is an acute, zoonotic viral disease of domestic ruminants, caused by a phlebovirus (Bunyaviridae family). A large outbreak occurred in Madagascar in 2008-2009. The goal of the present study was to evaluate the point prevalence of antibodies against Rift Valley Fever Virus (RVFV) in cattle in the Anjozorobe district, located in the wet and temperate highland region of Madagascar and yet heavily affected by the disease, and analyse environmental and trade factors potentially linked to RVFV transmission. A serological study was performed in 2009 in 894 bovines. For each bovine, the following variables were recorded: age, location of the night pen, minimum distance from the pen to the nearest water point and the forest, nearest water point type, and herd replacement practices. The serological data were analyzed using a generalized linear mixed model. The overall anti-RVFV IgG seroprevalence rate was 28% [CI95% 25-31]. Age was statistically linked to prevalence (p = 10(-4)), being consistent with a recurrent RVFV circulation. Distance from the night pen to the nearest water point was a protective factor (p = 5.10(-3)), which would be compatible with a substantial part of the virus transmission being carried out by nocturnal mosquito vectors. However, water point type did not influence the risk of infection: several mosquito species are probably involved. Cattle belonging to owners who purchase animals to renew the herd were significantly more likely to have seroconverted than others (p = 0.04): cattle trade may contribute to the introduction of the virus in this area. The minimum distance of the night pen to the forest was not linked to the prevalence. This is the first evidence of a recurrent transmission of RVFV in such an ecosystem that associates a wet, temperate climate, high altitude, paddy fields, and vicinity to a dense rain forest. Persistence mechanisms need to be further investigated.

T2  - 2009 IEEE INTERNATIONAL GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING SYMPOSIUM, VOLS 1-5
CP  - IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium
AB  - This study compares six change detection techniques to study land cover change associated with tropical forest (El Rawashda forest reserve, Gedaref State. Sudan). For this site, Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) data acquired on March 22, 2003 and Aster data acquired on February 26, 2006 were used. The change detection techniques employed in this study were Post-Classification Comparison (PCC). image differencing of different vegetation indices (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) and Transformed Difference Vegetation Index (TDVI)), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Multivariate Alteration Detection (MAD), Change Vector Analysis (CVA) and Tasseled Cap Analysis (TCA).
   As field validation data did not exist for 2003, a manual classification was performed, then a change map was conducted to locate and identify change in vegetation This change map was used as a reference to quantitatively assess the accuracy of each change-detection techniques Based on accuracy assessment, the most successful technique was the PCC technique with an accuracy of 94% This was followed by the MAD technique with an accuracy 88.8% However, among vegetation indices techniques, TDVI stood out as better than NDVI and SAVI in its ability to accurately identify vegetation change

TI  - ECTOPARASITES IN FREE-RANGING AMERICAN KESTRELS IN ARGENTINA: IMPLICATIONS FOR THE TRANSMISSION OF VIRAL DISEASES
T2  - JOURNAL OF RAPTOR RESEARCH
AB  - We described ectoparasitic species such as chewing lice, mites, and louse flies in free-ranging American Kestrels (Falco sparverius) in the semiarid forest of Argentina. From twenty-two adults and one juvenile American Kestrel captured (fourteen females and nine males) during four breeding seasons between 2005 and 2008, we found in seven birds (six females and one male) two louse species (Laemobothrion tinnunculi and Degeeriella carruthi), one mite species (Ornithonyssus bursa) and one louse fly (Icosta americana). Although the two louse species have been previously reported as parasites of American Kestrels, this is the first record for O. bursa in American Kestrels and the first for I. americana in Argentina. This finding is of particular interest because West Nile Virus (WNV) has been detected in I. americana, which suggests a potential role of this louse fly in the transmission of WNV in raptors in North America. Our results highlight the need for further studies on American Kestrel ectoparasites and also on host-parasite interactions for other neotropical raptors to better understand effects of parasitism on the health of those bird species and to detect possible vectors of infectious diseases.

TI  - Vector-borne transmission and evolution of Zika virus
T2  - NATURE ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV), discovered in the Zika Forest of Uganda in 1947, is a mosquito-borne flavivirus related to yellow fever, dengue and West Nile viruses. From its discovery until 2007, only sporadic ZIKV cases were reported, with mild clinical manifestations in patients. Therefore, little attention was given to this virus before epidemics in the South Pacific and the Americas that began in 2013. Despite a growing number of ZIKV studies in the past three years, many aspects of the virus remain poorly characterized, particularly the spectrum of species involved in its transmission cycles. Here, we review the mosquito and vertebrate host species potentially involved in ZIKV vector-borne transmission worldwide. We also provide an evidence-supported analysis regarding the possibility of ZIKV spillback from an urban cycle to a zoonotic cycle outside Africa, and we review hypotheses regarding recent emergence and evolution of ZIKV. Finally, we identify critical remaining gaps in the current knowledge of ZIKV vector-borne transmission.

TI  - Mapping dengue risk in Singapore using Random Forest
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   Singapore experiences endemic dengue, with 2013 being the largest outbreak year known to date, culminating in 22,170 cases. Given the limited resources available, and that vector control is the key approach for prevention in Singapore, it is important that public health professionals know where resources should be invested in. This study aims to stratify the spatial risk of dengue transmission in Singapore for effective deployment of resources.
   Methodology/principal findings
   Random Forest was used to predict the risk rank of dengue transmission in 1 km(2) grids, with dengue, population, entomological and environmental data. The predicted risk ranks are categorized and mapped to four color-coded risk groups for easy operation application. The risk maps were evaluated with dengue case and cluster data. Risk maps produced by Random Forest have high accuracy. More than 80% of the observed risk ranks fell within the 80% prediction interval. The observed and predicted risk ranks were highly correlated (rho >= 0.86, P < 0.01). Furthermore, the predicted risk levels were in excellent agreement with case density, a weighted Kappa coefficient of more than 0.80 (P < 0.01). Close to 90% of the dengue clusters occur in high risk areas, and the odds of cluster forming in high risk areas were higher than in low risk areas.
   Conclusions
   This study demonstrates the potential of Random Forest and its strong predictive capability in stratifying the spatial risk of dengue transmission in Singapore. Dengue risk map produced using Random Forest has high accuracy, and is a good surveillance tool to guide vector control operations.

TI  - Introduced primate species of an Atlantic Forest region in Brazil: present and future implications for the native fauna
T2  - TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE
AB  - The Atlantic Forest of the state of Rio de Janeiro was the habitat of six native primate species: Callithrix aurita, Leontopithecus rosalia, Alouatta guariba clamitans, Brachyteles arachnoides, Callicebus nigrifrons and Cebus nigritus; a seventh species, Brachteles hypoxanthus, possibly occurs in the state. In the literature, the number of non-native primate species for the state was less (three) than the native species (six or seven). Our study reviews the list of primate species, both native and non-native, within the state of Rio de Janeiro and discusses the possible impacts of the introduced primates on the native fauna. Using data from the literature, personal communication with experts, data from Brazilian Federal datasets (Linha Verde and CETAS), and specimens deposited in scientific collections of museums, we recorded 17 primate species with at least one record within the state of Rio de Janeiro. At least eight taxa can be considered non-native to the state. Conservation implications for native fauna may include food resource depletion and competition, hybridization, and disease transmission. Some of these effects were already recorded on the native fauna. We believe the removal of non-native primate species from the state is necessary in order to preserve native fauna regardless of political and ethical issues.

TI  - Digital mapping of soil parent material in a heterogeneous tropical area
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
AB  - Parent material is one of the five factors in soil formation. Studies on parent material allow interpreting soil genesis processes and improve our knowledge of specific soil attributes. However, soil parent material maps at detailed cartographic scale (finer than 1:100,000) are rare in tropical areas and it is usually inferred from poorly detailed geological data, which generally group different lithologies into single units. Thus, we propose a methodology to map soil parent material based on remote sensing and machine learning in a geologically very complex area. The study site covers 1378 km(2) in Sao Paulo State, Brazil. Prediction models used data from 280 geological observation points, a digital elevation model (spatial resolution of 5 m, upscale to 30 m) and multitemporal Landsat images in a range of 30 years. We evaluated six classification algorithms, namely random forest, decision tree, support vector machine, multinomial logistic regression, K-means (unsupervised classification), and object-based image analysis with maximum likelihood classification. Environmental covariates were grouped to create different scenarios combining terrain derivatives, hydrologic covariates, topsoil spectral reflectance, and spatial coordinates. A bare soil image, elaborated using 30 years of Landsat data, was evaluated as a covariate to predict soil parent material. Predictions were validated using three different strategies: crossvalidation, separate validation dataset (20%), and comparison with legacy geological maps (information from two areas with geological maps at fine scale). We also assessed the correspondence between the map of predicted soil parent material and data of soil particle size from 571 soil sampling points. Random forest algorithm presented the best validation performance, whereas the group of terrain derivatives and hydrologic covariates explained most of model variation. The produced parent material map was coherent with the spatial distribution of soil particle size across the study area. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Humans and Great Apes Cohabiting the Forest Ecosystem in Central African Republic Harbour the Same Hookworms
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background: Hookworms are important pathogens of humans. To date, Necator americanus is the sole, known species of the genus Necator infecting humans. In contrast, several Necator species have been described in African great apes and other primates. It has not yet been determined whether primate-originating Necator species are also parasitic in humans.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: The infective larvae of Necator spp. were developed using modified Harada-Mori filter-paper cultures from faeces of humans and great apes inhabiting Dzanga-Sangha Protected Areas, Central African Republic. The first and second internal transcribed spacers (ITS-1 and ITS-2) of nuclear ribosomal DNA and partial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) gene of mtDNA obtained from the hookworm larvae were sequenced and compared. Three sequence types (I-III) were recognized in the ITS region, and 34 cox1 haplotypes represented three phylogenetic groups (A-C). The combinations determined were I-A, II-B, II-C, III-B and III-C. Combination I-A, corresponding to N. americanus, was demonstrated in humans and western lowland gorillas; II-B and II-C were observed in humans, western lowland gorillas and chimpanzees; III-B and III-C were found only in humans. Pairwise nucleotide difference in the cox1 haplotypes between the groups was more than 8%, while the difference within each group was less than 2.1%.
   Conclusions/Significance: The distinctness of ITS sequence variants and high number of pairwise nucleotide differences among cox1 variants indicate the possible presence of several species of Necator in both humans and great apes. We conclude that Necator hookworms are shared by humans and great apes co-habiting the same tropical forest ecosystems.

TI  - <i>Anopheles</i> (<i>Kerteszia</i>) <i>cruzii</i> (DIPTERA: CULICIDAE) IN PERIDOMICILIARY AREA DURING ASYMPTOMATIC MALARIA TRANSMISSION IN THE ATLANTIC FOREST: MOLECULAR IDENTIFICATION OF BLOOD-MEAL SOURCES INDICATES HUMANS AS PRIMARY INTERMEDIATE HOSTS
T2  - REVISTA DO INSTITUTO DE MEDICINA TROPICAL DE SAO PAULO
AB  - Anopheles (Kerteszia) cruzii has been implicated as the primary vector of human and simian malarias out of the Brazilian Amazon and specifically in the Atlantic Forest regions. The presence of asymptomatic human cases, parasite-positive wild monkeys and the similarity between the parasites infecting them support the discussion whether these infections can be considered as a zoonosis. Although many aspects of the biology of An. cruzii have already been addressed, studies conducted during outbreaks of malaria transmission, aiming at the analysis of blood feeding and infectivity, are missing in the Atlantic Forest. This study was conducted in the location of Palestina, Juquitiba, where annually the majority of autochthonous human cases are notified in the Atlantic Forest of the state of Sao Paulo. Peridomiciliary sites were selected for collection of mosquitoes in a perimeter of up to 100 m around the residences of human malaria cases. The mosquitoes were analyzed with the purpose of molecular identification of blood-meal sources and to examine the prevalence of Plasmodium. A total of 13,441 females of An. (Ker.) cruzii were collected. The minimum infection rate was calculated at 0.03% and 0.01%, respectively, for P. vivax and P. malariae and only human blood was detected in the blood-fed mosquitoes analyzed. This data reinforce the hypothesis that asymptomatic human carriers are the main source of anopheline infection in the peridomiciliary area, making the probability of zoonotic transmission less likely to happen.

TI  - Vaccination and Therapeutics: Responding to the Changing Epidemiology of Yellow Fever
T2  - CURRENT TREATMENT OPTIONS IN INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB  - Purpose of Review At the turn of the nineteenth century, yellow fever (YF) was considered the most dangerous infectious disease with high case fatality. Subsequent, mass vaccination campaigns coupled with widespread elimination of the YF mosquito vector significantly decreased YF cases and reduced outbreaks to the tropical and subtropical forested regions of Africa and South America. Recent Findings However, recent (2016) large outbreaks in Angola, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and South-Eastern Brazil, where previously had been demarcated as low-risk regions, have highlighted the possibility of a rapidly changing epidemiology and the potential re-emergence of yellow fever virus (YFV). Furthermore, the first-ever importation of YFV into Asia has highlighted the potential fear of YFV emerging as a global threat. In this review, we describe the changing epidemiology of YF outbreaks and highlight the use of public health policies, therapeutics, and vaccination as tools to help eliminate future YFV outbreaks.

TI  - <i>Lasiodiplodia fici</i> sp. nov., Causing Leaf Spot on Ficus altissima in China
T2  - PATHOGENS
AB  - High temperatures and the seasonality in tropical ecosystems favours plant pathogens, which result in many fungal diseases. Among these, diseases caused by Botryosphaeriaceae species are prominent as dieback, canker and leaf spots. In this research, we isolated one leaf-spot-causing Botryosphaeriaceae species from Ficus altissima leaves, which were collected in Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China. Isolation and identification of the pathogen were based on morphological and molecular aspects. Based on multigene phylogenetic analysis of combined internal transcribed spacer (ITS), translation elongation factor 1-alpha gene (tef1) and beta-tubulin gene (tub2), the fungus associated with leaf spots on F. altissima is described as Lasiodiplodia fici, a novel species. Pathogenicity assays were conducted by inoculating the fungus onto detached shoots and plants under controlled environmental conditions. The results revealed that the L. fici isolates can infect the plant tissues under stress conditions by developing disease symptoms on detached shoots within three days. However, when it was inoculated onto the leaves of the host and grown in natural conditions, the progression of the disease was slow. The putative pathogen was re-isolated, and Koch's assumptions were satisfied. This is the first report of Lasiodiplodia species causing disease on Ficus altissima. Results from the present study will provide additional knowledge on fungal pathogens associated with forest and ornamental plant species.

TI  - Comparative Assessment of Supervised Classifiers for Land Use-Land Cover Classification in a Tropical Region Using Time-Series PALSAR Mosaic Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Numerous classification algorithms have been proposed to create accurate classification maps using optical remote sensing data. However, few comparative studies evaluate the performance of classification algorithms with focus on tropical forests due to cloud effects. Advances in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) techniques and spatial resolution, mapping, and comparison of classification algorithms are possible. This research investigated the accuracy and processing speeds of five supervised classifiers, including Naive Bayes, AdaBoost, multi-layer perceptron, random forest (RF), and support vector machine, for land use-land cover (LULC) classification in a tropical region using time-series Advanced Land Observing Satellite-phased array type L-band SAR (ALOS-PALSAR) 25-m mosaic data. The study area is located in central Sumatra, Indonesia, where abundant forest-related carbon stocks exist. This investigation was intended to aid the implementation of a classification algorithm for the automatic creation of LULC classification maps. We perform object-based and pixel-based analyses to investigate the ability of the classifiers and their accuracies, respectively. RF had the best classification accuracy and processing speed in which the accuracies for 10 classes and 2 classes were 64.07% and 90.22% for pixel-based and 82.94% and 86.23% for object-based evaluations, respectively. These results indicate that RF is a useful classifier for the analysis of PALSAR mosaic data and that the automatic creation of highly accurate classification maps is possible by using time-series data. The outcome of this research will be valuable resources for biodiversity and global-warming mitigation efforts in the region.

TI  - Diversity, Composition, Taxa Biomarkers, and Functional Genes of Fish Gut Microbes in Peat Swamp Forests and its Converted Areas in North Selangor, Malaysia
T2  - PERTANIKA JOURNAL OF TROPICAL AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE
AB  - The aquatic organisms in peat swamp forests are under threat due to habitat degradation resulting from human activities. This study determines the fish gut microbes' diversity, composition, taxa biomarkers, and functional genes in peat swamp forests and its converted areas in North Selangor, Malaysia. Three undisturbed and disturbed areas nearby the peat swamp forests were selected. First, the 16S amplicon metagenomic analysis was conducted to assess the composition and diversity of bacterial communities in fish gut contents from both areas. Then, Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt) and Linear discriminant analysis Effect Size (LEfSe) were used to predict disease/pathogen related functional genes. This study revealed Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Fusobacteria, and Actinobacteria as the predominant phyla in both studied areas. In contrast, bacterial community profiles of disturbed and undisturbed areas were slightly dissimilar. Metagenome predictions revealed that genes are related to metabolism, environmental information processing, genetic information processing, cellular processes, human diseases, and organismal systems. Further investigation revealed six potential biomarker genes, including chronic myeloid leukaemia in an undisturbed area, Vibrio cholerae infection, bladder cancer, pathogenic Escherichia coli infection, Staphylococcus aureus infection, and pertussis in disturbed areas. This study revealed that the fish gut microbiome could be used as an indicator in comparing the undisturbed and disturbed ecosystems.

TI  - Forest Goers and Multidrug-Resistant Malaria in Cambodia: An Ethnographic Study
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Multidrug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum malaria on the Cambodia-Thailand border is associated with working in forested areas. Beyond broad recognition of "forest-going" as a risk factor for malaria, little is known about different forest-going populations in this region. In Oddar Meanchey Province in northwestern Cambodia, qualitative ethnographic research was conducted to gain an in-depth understanding of how different populations, mobility and livelihood patterns, and activities within the forest intersect with potentiate malaria risk and impact on the effectiveness of malaria control and elimination strategies. We found that most forest-going in this area is associated with obtaining precious woods, particularly Siamese rosewood. In the past, at-risk populations included large groups of temporary migrants. As timber supplies have declined, so have these large migrant groups. However, groups of local residents continue to go to the forest and are staying for longer. Most forest-goers had experienced multiple episodes of malaria and were well informed about malaria risk. However, economic realities mean that local residents continue to pursue forest-based livelihoods. Severe constraints of available vector control methods mean that forest-goers have limited capacity to prevent vector exposure. As forest-goers access the forest using many different entry and exit points, border screening and treatment interventions will not be feasible. Once in the forest, groups often converge in the same areas; therefore, interventions targeting the mosquito population may have a potential role. Ultimately, a multisectoral approach as well as innovative and flexible malaria control strategies will be required if malaria elimination efforts are to be successful.

TI  - Microbial faecal pollution of river water in a watershed of tropical Ethiopian highlands is driven by diffuse pollution sources
T2  - JOURNAL OF WATER AND HEALTH
AB  - Tropical communities in the developing world depend heavily on riverine systems for their socioeconomic development. However, these resources are poorly protected from diffuse pollution, and there is a lack of quantitative information regarding the microbial pollution characteristics of riverine water, despite frequently reported gastrointestinal diseases. The aim of our study was to apply faecal taxation (i.e., faecal pellet counting in representative test areas to estimate the potential availability of diffuse pollution sources) in combination with a detailed microbiological faecal pollution analysis in a riverine environment to elucidate the importance of diffuse pollution. To realize this approach, ambient faecal pellets, a multiparametric data set for standard faecal indicator bacteria (SFIB), including Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens spores and enterococci from catchment soil and river water, and a number of riverine water physicochemical variables were analysed during a one-year cycle. We demonstrated that the abundance of ambient faecal pellets, which were consistently counted at reference sites in the catchment, was associated with faecal pollution in the river water. Water SFIB, dissolved oxygen, nutrients, conductivity and total suspended solids were strongly linked with the abundance of ambient faecal pellets in the river catchment, as demonstrated by principal component analysis (PCA). Elevated concentrations of SFIB in the riverine water in the absence of rainfall also suggested the direct input of faecal bacteria into the riverine water by livestock (e.g., during watering) and humans (e.g., during bathing). Statistical analyses further revealed that the microbiological water quality of the investigated riverine water was not influenced by SFIB potentially occurring in the soil. This study demonstrates the importance of diffuse faecal pollution sources as major drivers of the microbiological quality of riverine water in the Ethiopian Highlands. In addition, a new successfully applied integrated approach could be very useful for developing predictive models, which would aid in forecasting riverine microbiological quality in tropical developing countries.

TI  - Hematological evaluation of free-living golden-headed lion tamarins (<i>Leontopithecus chrysomelas</i>) from an Urban Atlantic Forest
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL PRIMATOLOGY
AB  - Background The Atlantic Forest where the animals were captured is surrounded by residences, so this close contact could favor the presence of disease-transmitting pathogens, putting the local population at risk. For these and other factors, it is important to perform laboratory tests enabling the performance of important diagnoses. Methods Blood samples of 268 golden-headed lion tamarins (Leontopithecus chrysomelas) inhabiting an Atlantic Forest area in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, were processed for accessing age and sex influence in hematological parameters and to establish normative hematology values. Results Mean values of red blood cells, hematocrit, hemoglobin, and platelet count were significantly higher in adult males than in adult females. Adult animals had significantly higher mean neutrophil count, and young animals had higher averages than adults in lymphocyte values. Anisocytosis and platelet indices parameters were also provided for the first time. Conclusions Averages presented can be used as hematological parameters for golden-headed lion tamarins.

TI  - <i>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</i> and the Collapse of Anuran Species Richness and Abundance in the Upper Manu National Park, Southeastern Peru
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
AB  - Amphibians are declining worldwide, but these declines have been particularly dramatic in tropical mountains, where high endemism and vulnerability to an introduced fungal pathogen, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), is associated with amphibian extinctions. We surveyed frogs in the Peruvian Andes in montane forests along a steep elevational gradient (1200-3700 m). We used visual encounter surveys to sample stream-dwelling and arboreal species and leaf-litter plots to sample terrestrial-breeding species. We compared species richness and abundance among the wet seasons of 1999, 2008, and 2009. Despite similar sampling effort among years, the number of species (46 in 1999) declined by 47% between 1999 and 2008 and by 38% between 1999 and 2009. When we combined the number of species we found in 2008 and 2009, the decline from 1999 was 36%. Declines of stream-dwelling and arboreal species (a reduction in species richness of 55%) were much greater than declines of terrestrial-breeding species (reduction of 20% in 2008 and 24% in 2009). Similarly, abundances of stream-dwelling and arboreal frogs were lower in the combined 2008-2009 period than in 1999, whereas densities of frogs in leaf-litter plots did not differ among survey years. These declines may be associated with the infection of frogs with Bd. B. dendrobatidis prevalence correlated significantly with the proportion of species that were absent from the 2008 and 2009 surveys along the elevational gradient. Our results suggest Bd may have arrived at the site between 1999 and 2007, which is consistent with the hypothesis that this pathogen is spreading in epidemic waves along the Andean cordilleras. Our results also indicate a rapid decline of frog species richness and abundance in our study area, a national park that contains many endemic amphibian species and is high in amphibian species richness.

TI  - What would happen to the trees and lianas if apes disappeared?
T2  - ORYX
AB  - Apes, like many frugivorous animals, are crucial allies for the reproduction of several fruiting tree species. Almost all apes, however, including bonobos Pan paniscus, are threatened with extinction. How will this affect tree conservation? How can plants that are adapted to seed dispersal by apes reproduce without their dispersal vectors? At LuiKotale, in an evergreen tropical forest of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the recruitment of 22 plant species in the absence of seed dispersal was investigated under the parental canopy, where a proportion of seeds fall without horizontal dissemination. Most bonobo-dispersed plant species (95% of 19 species) were unable to self-recruit under the canopy. As 40% of the tree species (65% of trees) at LuiKotale are dispersed by bonobos there is a risk of ecosystem decay and simplification (reduced biodiversity) if Pan paniscus disappears from its natural range. The extinction of other apes from their forests could have similar consequences. The conservation of tree species, therefore, must encompass conservation of pollinators, seed dispersal vectors and other species that provide ecological services to the trees and other fruiting plants.

TI  - REMOTE-SENSING AS A LANDSCAPE EPIDEMIOLOGIC TOOL TO IDENTIFY VILLAGES AT HIGH-RISK FOR MALARIA TRANSMISSION
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - A landscape approach using remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) technologies was developed to discriminate between villages at high and low risk for malaria transmission, as defined by adult Anopheles albimanus abundance. Satellite data for an area in southern Chiapas, Mexico were digitally processed to generate a map of landscape elements. The GIS processes were used to determine the proportion of mapped landscape elements surrounding 40 villages where An. albimanus abundance data had been collected. The relationships between vector abundance and landscape element proportions were investigated using stepwise discriminant analysis and stepwise linear regression. Both analyses indicated that the most important landscape elements in terms of explaining vector abundance were transitional swamp and unmanaged pasture. Discriminant functions generated for these two elements were able to correctly distinguish between villages with high and low vector abundance, with an overall accuracy of 90%. Regression results found both transitional swamp and unmanaged pasture proportions to be predictive of vector abundance during the mid-to-late wet season. This approach, which integrates remotely sensed data and GIS capabilities to identify villages with high vector-human contact risk, provides a promising tool for malaria surveillance programs that depend on labor-intensive field techniques. This is particularly relevant in areas where the lack of accurate surveillance capabilities may result in no malaria control action when, in fact, directed action is necessary. In general, this landscape approach could be applied to other vector-borne diseases in areas where 1) the landscape elements critical to vector survival are known and 2) these elements can be detected at remote sensing scales.

TI  - Comparative prevalence of sensitization to common animal, plant and mould allergens in subjects with asthma, or atopic dermatitis and/or allergic rhinitis living in a tropical environment
T2  - CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL ALLERGY
AB  - Background and objectives Current information suggests that the expression of allergic diseases is determined by the exposure and nature of the allergen. The objectives of the present study were to determine if the nature of allergenic exposition to animal, plant or fungal allergens influenced the clinical manifestations of atopic dermatitis (AD), allergic rhinitis (AR) or asthma (AS) in patients living in a tropical environment. The prevalence and degree of sensitization to these allergens were analysed by age and gender.
   Subjects and methods A total of 1496 atopic cases, grouped according to the primary diagnosis of AD or AR or AS, were skin tested using a standardized allergen panel. Participants were categorized by age groups. The atopic index (AI) and mean weal diameter (MWD) as well as the prevalence of positive skin tests were determined for each of the patient groups and compared by age groups.
   Results The prevalence of atopy as well as the AI and the MWD peaked at 6-15 years of age and declined thereafter. In all the patients tested, the prevalence of sensitization was, in decreasing order; dust mites 94.3%, cockroach 41.5%, pets 31.5%, plant allergens 31.1% and fungal 19.4%. Eight hundred and ninety-three atopic patients were exclusively sensitized only to animal allergens. Of these, 38.4% had AD, 31.3% had AR and 30.5% with AS.
   Conclusion These data demonstrate that for patients with AD, AR and AS living in a tropical environment, the prevalence of positive skin reactions to animal allergens is highest followed by plant and fungal allergens. We did not observe any association between the type of allergen and clinical manifestations. The index of atopy was similar for both sexes. The prevalence and degree of sensitization were shown to peak in young adults independent of the allergen in AD and AR patients.

TI  - Vaccination and Therapeutics: Responding to the Changing Epidemiology of Yellow Fever
T2  - CURRENT TREATMENT OPTIONS IN INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB  - Purpose of Review At the turn of the nineteenth century, yellow fever (YF) was considered the most dangerous infectious disease with high case fatality. Subsequent, mass vaccination campaigns coupled with widespread elimination of the YF mosquito vector significantly decreased YF cases and reduced outbreaks to the tropical and subtropical forested regions of Africa and South America. Recent Findings However, recent (2016) large outbreaks in Angola, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and South-Eastern Brazil, where previously had been demarcated as low-risk regions, have highlighted the possibility of a rapidly changing epidemiology and the potential re-emergence of yellow fever virus (YFV). Furthermore, the first-ever importation of YFV into Asia has highlighted the potential fear of YFV emerging as a global threat. In this review, we describe the changing epidemiology of YF outbreaks and highlight the use of public health policies, therapeutics, and vaccination as tools to help eliminate future YFV outbreaks.

TI  - Rapid health evaluation in migrant peoples in transit through Darien, Panama: protocol for a multimethod qualitative and quantitative study
T2  - THERAPEUTIC ADVANCES IN INFECTIOUS DISEASE
AB  - Background: The world is currently unprepared to deal with the drastic increase in global migration. There is an urgent need to develop programs to protect the well-being and health of migrant peoples. Increased population movement is already evident throughout the Americas as exemplified by the rising number of migrant peoples who pass through the Darien neotropical moist broadleaf forest along the border region between Panama and Colombia. The transit of migrant peoples through this area has an increase in the last years. In 2021, an average of 9400 people entered the region per month compared with 2000-3500 people monthly in 2019. Along this trail, there is no access to health care, food provision, potable water, or housing. To date, much of what is known about health needs and barriers to health care within this population is based on journalistic reports and anecdotes. There is a need for a comprehensive approach to assess the health care needs of migrant peoples in transit. This study aims to describe demographic characteristics, mental and physical health status and needs, and experiences of host communities, and to identify opportunities to improve health care provision to migrant peoples in transit in Panama.
   Study design and methods: This multimethod study will include qualitative (n = 70) and quantitative (n = 520) components. The qualitative component includes interviews with migrant peoples in transit, national and international nongovernmental organizations and agencies based in Panama. The quantitative component is a rapid epidemiological study which includes a questionnaire and four clinical screenings: mental health, sexual and reproductive health, general and tropical medicine, and nutrition.
   Conclusion: This study will contribute to a better understanding of the health status and needs of migrant peoples in transit through the region. Findings will be used to allocate resources and provide targeted health care interventions for migrant peoples in transit through Darien, Panama.

TI  - AVIRIS-NG HYPERSPECTRAL DATA FOR MAPPING MANGROVE FORESTS AND THEIR HEALTH SPATIALLY: A CASE STUDY OF INDIAN SUNDARBANS
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL FOREST SCIENCE
AB  - The present work deals with the classification of mangrove forests and determination of their health spatially using Airborne Visual Imaging Infrared Spectrometer-Next Generation data over a portion of Indian Sundarbans. The objectives were to test pixel-based classifiers and object-based approach for classification of mangroves into floristic composition classes and map the health status of the forests. Five known spectral indices were applied in Decision Tree algorithm for identifying mangrove forests, followed by creation of a mangrove mask of the study area. Spectral Angle Mapper, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Object-Based Image Analysis classifiers were separately evaluated on the data within the mask. The overall classification accuracy was highest in SVM (99%). A total of 10 floristic composition classes were obtained. The classes were further classified into three health classes, viz. most healthy, moderately healthy and less healthy/stressed using different vegetation indices for greenness, light-use efficiency, leaf pigments and canopy moisture contents. The methodology presented here holds good opportunity to be applied to other mangrove forests for producing mangrove health maps at finer levels.

TI  - Incidence and Effect of Heart Rot in Marayur Sandalwood (Santalum album L.) Reserve, Kerala, and Its Natural Durability Against Fungi
T2  - FOREST SCIENCE
AB  - Indian sandalwood (Santalum album L.) is a semi-parasitic tree, well known for its valuable sandalwood oil extracted from heartwood and roots. Extensive loss of heartwood as a result of its decay is observed in living trees and this has inspired the current study, to investigate the health of sandalwood in Marayur sandalwood forest reserves. Located in Kerala, India, the majority of the trees in Marayur are facing high mortality with the loss of heartwood. The current study evaluated the health status and heartwood-rot disease severity of each tree, which revealed that only 16.67 % of the total trees were healthy and 1.5 % of them were dead. Statistical analysis revealed increasing girth class of trees has a significant positive association with increased disease severity at a 0.05 level of significance. Laboratory analysis confirmed the presence of the major wood-rotters Allophoma tropica, Xylaria berteroi, Diaporthe sp., Fomes sp., Ganoderma appalanatum, and Trametes sp., and that they are collectively responsible for the heart rot. A durability assessment revealed sandalwood is highly resistant (durability class I) to white-rot fungi (viz., Trametes hirsutus and T. [Coriolus] versicolor) and moderately resistant (durability class II) to brown-rot fungi (Oligoporous placenta and Fomitopsis meliae). Study implications: This study highlights the health status and heart-rot disease severity of sandalwood trees in Marayur Forest Reserves. Of the total trees surveyed, about 1.5% mortality was observed and only 17% of the trees were devoid of any heart-rot symptoms. Allophoma tropica, Ganoderma applanatum, Xylaria berteroi isolate SR52, Diaporthe sp., Fomes sp., G. appalanatum, and Trametes sp. are typical species collectively responsible for the heart rot and this was found to be the case in our study. These findings will sensitize forest managers to the loss of valuable sandalwood and death of the trees due to the heart rot, thereby enabling them to take appropriate preventive measures. Also, the natural durability of sandalwood against brown- and white-rot fungi is reported for the first time, indicating that sandalwood falls in the resistance class I (highly resistant) against white-rot fungi (Trametes hirsutus and T. (Coriolus) versicolor) and resistance class II (resistant) against brown-rot fungi (Oligoporous placenta and Fomitopsis meliae).

TI  - Land-cover binary change detection methods for use in the moist tropical region of the Amazon: a comparative study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Many land-cover change detection techniques have been developed; however, different conclusions about the value or appropriateness of each exist. This difference of opinion is often influenced by the landscape complexity of study areas and data used for analysis. Which method is most suitable for land-cover change detection in Amazon tropical regions remains unclear. In this paper, 10 binary change detection methods were implemented and compared with respect to their capability to detect land-cover change and no change conditions in moist tropical regions. They are image differencing (ID), modified image differencing (MID), a combination of image differencing and principal component analysis (IDPCA), principal component differencing (PCD), multitemporal PCA (MPCA), change vector analysis (CVA), vegetation index differencing (VID), image ratioing (IR), modified image ratioing (MIR), and a combination of image ratioing and PCA (IRPCA). Multi-temporal Thematic Mapper (TM) data were used to conduct land-cover binary change detection. Research results indicate that MID, PCD and ID using TM band 5 are significantly better than other binary change detection methods and they are recommended specifically for implementation in the Amazon basin.

TI  - Individual and seasonal variation in the movement behavior of two tropical nectarivorous birds
T2  - MOVEMENT ECOLOGY
AB  - Background Movement of animals directly affects individual fitness, yet fine spatial and temporal resolution movement behavior has been studied in relatively few small species, particularly in the tropics. Nectarivorous Hawaiian honeycreepers are believed to be highly mobile throughout the year, but their fine-scale movement patterns remain unknown. The movement behavior of these crucial pollinators has important implications for forest ecology, and for mortality from avian malaria (Plasmodium relictum), an introduced disease that does not occur in high-elevation forests where Hawaiian honeycreepers primarily breed. Methods We used an automated radio telemetry network to track the movement of two Hawaiian honeycreeper species, the Modified Letter Turned Commaapapane (Himatione sanguinea) and Modified Letter Turned CommaiModified Letter Turned Commaiwi (Drepanis coccinea). We collected high temporal and spatial resolution data across the annual cycle. We identified movement strategies using a multivariate analysis of movement metrics and assessed seasonal changes in movement behavior. Results Both species exhibited multiple movement strategies including sedentary, central place foraging, commuting, and nomadism , and these movement strategies occurred simultaneously across the population. We observed a high degree of intraspecific variability at the individual and population level. The timing of the movement strategies corresponded well with regional bloom patterns of 'ohi'a (Metrosideros polymorpha) the primary nectar source for the focal species. Birds made long-distance flights, including multi-day forays outside the tracking array, but exhibited a high degree of fidelity to a core use area, even in the non-breeding period. Both species visited elevations where avian malaria can occur but exhibited little seasonal change in elevation (< 150 m) and regularly returned to high-elevation roosts at night. Conclusions This study demonstrates the power of automated telemetry to study complex and fine-scale movement behaviors in rugged tropical environments. Our work reveals a system in which birds can track shifting resources using a diverse set of movement behaviors and can facultatively respond to environmental change. Importantly, fidelity to high-elevation roosting sites minimizes nocturnal exposure to avian malaria for far-ranging individuals and is thus a beneficial behavior that may be under high selection pressure.

TI  - Lassa Fever in Guinea: II. Distribution and Prevalence of Lassa Virus Infection in Small Mammals
T2  - VECTOR-BORNE AND ZOONOTIC DISEASES
AB  - Rodents of the genus Mastomys form the reservoir for Lassa virus (LV), an arenavirus that causes a potentially severe hemorrhagic illness, Lassa fever (LF). Although Mastomys rodents exist throughout sub-Saharan Africa, areas of human LF appear to be quite focal. The distribution of small mammals and LV-infected Mastomys has been assessed in only a few countries. We conducted a survey of small mammals in selected regions of Guinea to assess the degree to which LV poses a public health risk in that country. A total of 1,616 small mammals, including 956 (59%) Mastomys, were captured from 444 households and seven bush sites. Mastomys made up >90% of the captured animals in the savannah, savannah-forest transition, and forest regions of Guinea, while Mus musculus dominated in coastal and urban sites. Animals were analyzed via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for LV-specific antigen (blood and spleen homogenate) and IgG antibody (blood only). Virus isolation from spleen homogenates was also performed on a subset of animals. Lassa antibody and antigen were found in 96 (11%) and 46 (5%), respectively, of 884 tested Mastomys. Antibody and antigen were essentially mutually exclusive and showed profiles consistent with vertical transmission of both LV and antibody. LV was isolated only from Mastomys. ELISA antigen constituted an acceptable surrogate for virus isolation, with a sensitivity and specificity when performed on blood of 78% (95% confidence interval: 68-83%) and 98% (95-99%), respectively. The proportion of LV-infected Mastomys per region ranged from 0 to 9% and was highest in the savannah and forest zones. The proportion of infected animals per village varied considerably, even between villages in close proximity. Infected animals tended to cluster in relatively few houses, suggesting the existence of focal "hot spots" of LV-infected Mastomys that may account for the observed heterogeneous distribution of LF.

TI  - Bee pollination and evidence of substitutive nectary in <i>Anadenanthera colubrina</i> (Leguminosae-Mimosoideae)
T2  - ARTHROPOD-PLANT INTERACTIONS
AB  - Anadenanthera colubrina (Vell.) Brenan (Leguminosae-Mimosoideae) is a widely-distributed tree in seasonally dry tropical forests of South America that was classified previously as lacking nectaries. However, some studies have stated that its flowers produce nectar, while others analyzed the composition of unifloral honey produced from A. colubrina flowers, raising the question about nectar production in the species. We studied the pollination and reproductive biology of A. colubrina var. cebil (Griseb.) Altschul in a natural population in the Caatinga, northeastern Brazil. Reproductive phenology, sexual system, floral biology, resource, and pollinators were investigated. We analyzed the breeding system through controlled pollinations for addressing its dependence on pollen vectors for reproduction. Anadenanthera colubrina flowered in the dry season, flower heads are heteromorphic, with staminate flowers at the base and perfect flowers at the apex of the inflorescence, characterizing andromonoecy. Anthesis is diurnal. We observed small drops of nectar at the apex of the petals of some flowers per inflorescence. Together with observations on flower visitor behavior and histochemical tests, we propose that A. colubrina produces floral nectar at the apex of the corolla, characterizing a substitutive nectary (sensu Vogel). This is the first record of substitutive nectary in the Mimosoideae and the first record of andromonoecy in the genus. Bees were the main pollinators (higher frequency), although other insects such as wasps, butterflies, and small beetles were also observed collecting nectar and/or pollen. The species is self-incompatible, thus depending on insect pollen vectors, mainly bees, for reproduction.

TI  - Genetic analysis of post-epizootic amphibian chytrid strains in Bolivia: Adding a piece to the puzzle
T2  - TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES
AB  - The evolutionary history and dispersal pattern of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), an emergent fungal pathogen responsible for the decline and extinctions of many species of amphibians worldwide, is still not well understood. In South America, the tropical Andes are known as an important site for amphibian diversification, but also for being a place where hosts are at greater risk of chytridiomycosis. In an attempt to understand the history and the geographic pattern of Bd-associated amphibian declines in Bolivia, we isolated Bd from hosts at two locations that differ in their chronology of Bd prevalence and host survival outcome, the cloud forests of the Amazonian slopes of the Andes and Lake Titicaca in the altiplano. We genotyped Bd from both locations and sequenced the genome from the cloud forest isolate and then compared them to reference sequences of other Bd strains across the world. We found that the Bolivian chytrid isolates were nearly genotypically identical and that they belong to the global panzootic lineage (Bd-GPL). The Bolivian Bd strain grouped with other tropical New World strains but was closest to those from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Our results extend the presence of Bd-GPL to the central Andes in South America and report this hypervirulent strain at Lago Titicaca, where Bd has been detected since 1863, without evidence of amphibian declines. These findings suggest a more complex evolutionary history for this pathogen in Bolivia and may point to the existence of an old lineage of Bd that has since been extirpated following the arrival of the panzootic Bd-GPL or that the timing of Bd-GPL emergence is earlier than generally acknowledged.

TI  - Extracellular non-coding RNA signatures of the metacestode stage of <i>Echinococcus multilocularis</i>
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Extracellular RNAs (ex-RNAs) are secreted by cells through different means that may involve association with proteins, lipoproteins or extracellular vesicles (EV). In the context of parasitism, ex-RNAs represent new and exciting communication intermediaries with promising potential as novel biomarkers. In the last years, it was shown that helminth parasites secrete ex-RNAs, however, most work mainly focused on RNA secretion mediated by EV. Ex-RNA study is of special interest in those helminth infections that still lack biomarkers for early and/or follow-up diagnosis, such as echinococcosis, a neglected zoonotic disease caused by cestodes of the genus Echinococcus. In this work, we have characterised the ex-RNA profile secreted by in vitro grown metacestodes of Echinococcus multilocularis, the casuative agent of alveolar echinococcosis.
   We have used high throughput RNA-sequencing together with RT-qPCR to characterise the ex-RNA profile secreted towards the extra- and intra-parasite milieus in EV-enriched and EV-depleted fractions. We show that a polarized secretion of small RNAs takes place, with microRNAs mainly secreted to the extra-parasite milieu and rRNA- and tRNA-derived sequences mostly secreted to the intra-parasite milieu. In addition, we show by nanoparticle tracking analyses that viable metacestodes secrete EV mainly into the metacestode inner vesicular fluid (MVF); however, the number of nanoparticles in culture medium and MVF increases > 10-fold when metacestodes show signs of tegument impairment. Interestingly, we confirm the presence of host miRNAs in the intra-parasite milieu, implying their internalization and transport through the tegument towards the MVF. Finally, our assessment of the detection of Echinococcus miRNAs in patient samples by RT-qPCR yielded negative results suggesting the tested miRNAs may not be good biomarkers for this disease.
   A comprehensive study of the secretion mechanisms throughout the life cycle of these parasites will help to understand parasite interaction with the host and also, improve current diagnostic tools.
   Author summary
   Extracellular RNAs (ex-RNAs) are secreted by cells through association with proteins or extracellular vesicles (EV). In the context of parasitism, ex-RNAs represent novel communication intermediaries with promising potential as biomarkers. In order to better understand the role ex-RNAs may play in the context of the zoonotic disease echinococcosis, we have characterised the RNA profile secreted by the larval stage (metacestode) of Echinococcus multilocularis.
   By analysing the products secreted towards the extra- and intra-parasite milieus, we demonstrate that the metacestode displays a polarized secretion of different classes of small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs). In addition, we show that EV secretion occurs mainly towards the inner fluid of the metacestodes. Interestingly, we confirm the presence of host sRNAs in the intra-parasite milieu, implying their internalization and transport through the tegument. Finally, the detection of Echinococcus miRNAs in patient samples yielded negative results suggesting the tested miRNAs may not be good biomarkers for this disease.
   In summary, our results provide a detailed description of the ex-RNA landscape of the E. multilocularis metacestode together with information on the distribution of the detected RNA classes in different extracellular compartments. This information is of importance to better understand host-parasite interaction and also, to improve current diagnostic tools.

TI  - Richness of <i>Cladosporium</i> in a tropical bat cave with the description of two new species
T2  - MYCOLOGICAL PROGRESS
AB  - Caves are important roosts for hundreds of bat species worldwide. Such habitats frequently harbour rich and extremely specialised biotas; however, they remain among the least-studied places on Earth, particularly in the tropical region. The fungal richness in tropical caves in Brazil has recently been studied, and these surveys have reported a largely unexplored mycobiome, highlighting some bat caves as hotspots for fungal findings. During a speleomycological survey in a bat cave in the Caatinga dry forest in Brazil, 15 Cladosporium isolates were obtained from the air and ectoparasitic bat flies (Diptera: Streblidae) collected from the bat Pteronotus gymnonotus (Chiroptera: Mormoopidae). Based on morphological features and multi-gene (ITS rDNA, ACT, and TEF1) phylogenetic analyses, we reported eight Cladosporium species in this cave. Two new species, Cladosporium cavernicola and Cladosporium pernambucoense, were isolated from the cave air and have been formally described here. They, along with Cladosporium puris, Cladosporium subuliforme, and Cladosporium tenuissimum, were related to the Cladosporium cladosporioides species complex. Additionally, we recorded Cladosporium austrohemisphaericum, Cladosporium parahalotolerans, and Cladosporium sphaerospermum (C. sphaerospermum species complex). Our findings emphasise the large potential for new fungal species associated with caves and bats worldwide.

TI  - Metabolites derived from the tropical seagrass <i>Thalassia testudinum</i> are bioactive against pathogenic <i>Labyrinthula</i> sp
T2  - AQUATIC BOTANY
AB  - Temperate and tropical seagrasses are susceptible to wasting disease outbreaks caused by pathogenic protists of the genus Labyrinthula. Even though there is an increasing awareness of the environmental conditions that influence the etiology of seagrass-Labyrinthula disease dynamics, the biochemical basis of seagrass defense responses, in particular chemical defenses, is still vastly understudied. Using an in vitro bioassay, we provide evidence that previously characterized phenolic and potentially novel, undescribed non-phenolic metabolites derived from Thalassia testudinum Banks ex Konig exhibit anti-labyrinthulid activity. All phenolic compounds tested displayed dose-dependent behavior and selected combinations interacted synergistically. The flavone glycoside thalassiolin B was roughly 20-100 times more active than any phenolic acid tested. Based upon values reported in the literature, it was calculated that infected specimens of Thalassia testudinum contain natural concentrations of phenolic acids that are consistently greater than what is required to inhibit Labyrinthula growth. This suggests that while there may be an ample supply of phenolic-based derivatives available to inhibit Labyrinthula growth, they may not be readily bio-accessible.
   Using a bioactivity-guided approach, a semi-purified chemical fraction from Thalassia testudinum was found to contain anti-labyrinthulid activity. H-1 NMR spectra for this fraction lacked aromatic hydrogen signals, suggesting that the bioactive compound was non-aromatic in nature. Furthermore, the LC-MS fragmentation patterns were suggestive of the presence of glycosylated natural products of an unknown structural class.

TI  - Characterization of <i>spaC</i>-type <i>Erysipelothrix</i> sp isolates causing systemic disease in ornamental fish
T2  - JOURNAL OF FISH DISEASES
AB  - Since 2012, low-to-moderate mortality associated with an Erysipelothrix sp. bacterium has been reported in ornamental fish. Histological findings have included facial cellulitis, necrotizing dermatitis and myositis, and disseminated coelomitis with abundant intralesional Gram-positive bacterial colonies. Sixteen Erysipelothrix sp. isolates identified phenotypically as E.rhusiopathiae were recovered from diseased cyprinid and characid fish. Similar clinical and histological changes were also observed in zebrafish, Danio rerio, challenged by intracoelomic injection. The Erysipelothrix sp. isolates from ornamental fish were compared phenotypically and genetically to E.rhusiopathiae and E.tonsillarum isolates recovered from aquatic and terrestrial animals from multiple facilities. Results demonstrated that isolates from diseased fish were largely clonal and divergent from E.rhusiopathiae and E.tonsillarum isolates from normal fish skin, marine mammals and terrestrial animals. All ornamental fish isolates were PCR positive for spaC, with marked genetic divergence (<92% similarity at gyrB, <60% similarity by rep-PCR) between the ornamental fish isolates and other Erysipelothrix spp. isolates. This study supports previous work citing the genetic variability of Erysipelothrix spp. spa types and suggests isolates from diseased ornamental fish may represent a genetically distinct species.

TI  - Effects of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on the prevalence of the fungus <i>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</i> (Chytridiomycota) in stream tadpoles in the Atlantic Forest domain
T2  - AQUATIC ECOLOGY
AB  - Recent evidence indicates that infectious diseases are one of the main causes of amphibian decline worldwide. Chytridiomycosis is an emergent disease caused by the waterborne fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). The infectious stage of this pathogen comprises motile zoospores that encyst in amphibian host to form a zoosporangium, from which new zoospores are subsequently released into the water. Therefore, the aquatic environment facilitates Bd transmission, suggesting that tadpoles could be more prone to infection than adults. However, unlike adults, infection during the amphibian larval stage is rarely lethal. This leads to a high prevalence of Bd in tadpoles, consequently acting as reservoirs for this pathogen. With this study, we aim to understand the effects of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on the prevalence of Bd in an assemblage of stream tadpoles in the Atlantic Forest, south-eastern Brazil. For Bd detection, we inspected individuals' mouthparts searching for a specific pattern of depigmentation that has been widely associated with infection by this pathogen in tadpoles. Specimens presenting depigmentation compatible with the described patterns within the literature were classified as Bd-positive. We found 38.7% (209 out of 540) Bd-positive tadpoles. Slow-developing tadpoles presented a higher Bd prevalence compared to fast-developing tadpoles. Also, tadpoles inhabiting streams with lower temperatures and slower water flow presented high Bd prevalence regardless of their developmental duration. Our results suggest that slow-developing tadpoles can potentially act as effective Bd reservoir, and that cooler, slow-water streams could favour the pathogen maintenance in the environment.

TI  - The pollination and breeding system of Dipterocarpus obtusifolius (Dipterocarpaceae) in dry deciduous forests of Thailand
T2  - JOURNAL OF NATURAL HISTORY
AB  - The pollination biology of Dipterocarpus obtusifolius (Teijsm.), an obligately insect-pollinated dry deciduous dipterocarp tree, is described. For the first time, the pollinators of a Dipterocarpus species are identified, and they are found to be large Lepidoptera, a new pollination syndrome for this tree family. D. obtusifolius produces relatively few large, pink, pendulous flowers that emit a strong fragrance upon opening. Flowers open at dusk and remain open for 24-36h. Nectar secretion occurs at flower opening and continues through the next day. pollen is maximally available at night but much pollen remains available to daytime visitors. The stigma is spatially separated from the anthers but pollen presentation and stigma receptivity occur simultaneously. In artificial pollination experiments there was intense selection pressure, through abscission of young fruit, in favour of outcrossing. Pollination did not occur in the absence of insect vectors. Large moths (Sphingidae and Noctuidae) are the primary pollination vectors at night and account for 60% of pollen transfer. Butterflies (primarily Pieridae and Papilionidae) pollinate flowers during the day. It is likely that birds pollinate a small proportion of flowers. The pollination syndrome and breeding system of this species is discussed in relation to its biogeography.

TI  - Lineage Divergence and Vector-Specific Adaptation Have Driven Chikungunya Virus onto Multiple Adaptive Landscapes
T2  - MBIO
AB  - Previous studies have shown that the adaptation of Indian Ocean lineage (IOL) chikungunya virus (CHIKV) strains for Aedes albopictus transmission was mediated by an E1-A226V substitution, followed by either a single substitution in E2 or synergistic substitutions in the E2 and E3 envelope glycoproteins. Here, we examined whether Asian lineage strains, including those that descended from the 2014 Caribbean introduction, are likely to acquire these A albopictus-adaptive E2 substitutions. Because Asian lineage strains cannot adapt through the E1-A226V substitution due to an epistatic constraint, we first determined that the beneficial effect of these E2 mutations in IOL strains is independent of E1-A226V. We then introduced each of these E2 adaptive mutations into the Asian lineage backbone to determine if they improve infectivity for A albopictus. Surprisingly, our results indicated that in the Asian lineage backbone, these E2 mutations significantly decreased CHOW fitness in A. aibopictus. Furthermore, we tested the effects of these mutations in Aedes aegypti and observed different results from those in A. aibopictus, suggesting that mosquito species-specific factors that interact with the envelope proteins are involved in vector infection efficiency. Overall, our results indicate that the divergence between Asian lineage and IOL CHIKVs has led them onto different adaptive landscapes with differing potentials to expand their vector host range.
   IMPORTANCE Since its introduction into the Caribbean in October 2013, CHIKV has rapidly spread to almost the entire neotropical region. However, its potential to further spread globally, including into more temperate climates, depends in part on its ability to be transmitted efficiently by Aedes albopictus, which can survive colder winters than A. aegypti. We examined in an Asian lineage backbone A. aibopictus-adaptive mutations that arose from 2005 to 2009 in Indian Ocean lineage (IOL) strains. Our results predict that the Asian CHIKV lineage now in the Americas will not readily adapt for enhanced A. aibopictus transmission via the same mechanisms or adaptive mutations used previously by IOL strains. The vector species- and CHIKV lineage-specific effects caused by adaptive CHIKV envelope glycoprotein substitutions may elucidate our understanding of the mechanisms of mosquito infection and spread.

TI  - Suspended sediment load prediction modelling based on artificial intelligence methods: The tropical region as a case study
T2  - HELIYON
AB  - The impact of the suspended sediment load (SSL) on environmental health, agricultural operations, and water resources planning, is significant. The deposit of SSL restricts the streamflow region, affecting aquatic life migration and finally causing a river course shift. As a result, data on suspended sediments and their fluctuations are essential for a number of authorities especially for water resources decision makers. SSL prediction is often difficult due to a number of issues such as site-specific data, site-specific models, lack of several substantial components to use in prediction, and complexity its pattern. In the past two decades, many machine learning algorithms have shown huge potential for SSL river prediction. However, these models did not provide very reliable results, which led to the conclusion that the accuracy of SSL prediction should be improved. As a result, in order to solve past concerns, this research proposes a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model for SSL prediction. The proposed model was applied for SSL prediction in Johor River located in Malaysia. The study allocated data for suspended sediment load and river flow for period 2010 to 2020. In the current research, four alternative models-Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest (RF), and Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) were investigated to predict the suspended sediment load. The proposed model attained a high correlation value between predicted and actual SSL (0.97), with a minimum RMSE (148.4 ton/day and a minimum MAE (33.43 ton/day). and can thus be generalized for application in similar rivers around the world.

TI  - Adaptation of resistant grapevines varieties under tropical conditions: A social strategy for the post-conflict in Colombia
T2  - 42ND WORLD CONGRESS OF VINE AND WINE
CP  - 42nd World Congress of Vine and Wine
AB  - In Colombia, the grapevine can be considered as a promising crop over the post-conflict era. This research evaluated the local adaptation of more than fifty vine varieties resistant to diseases, direct producer hybrids (DPHs) and interspecific test crosses under tropical conditions with the approach of finding varieties with enough resistance to withstand the attacks of Plasmopara viticola, Guignardia bidwelii, Phomopsis viticola, Botrytis cinerea, Uncinula necator, among others; as well as its productive and quality characteristics. Another goal of our research is to reduce the number of applications of agrochemicals per productive period and thus doing the vine a more environment-friendly and economically more profitable crop. Our research has been developed in areas of the inter-Andean valley in central Colombia (department of Tolima) in the tropical dry forest life zone. This research is projected to become an implementation tool for the cultivation of the vine, economically, socially and environmentally viable; as a means of subsistence for peasant families, displaced and demobilized people in the post-conflict era of Colombia. In turn, it represents a replacement alternative to illicit crops such as coca and marijuana, which have flourished in areas affected by the war in Colombia.

TI  - OCULAR ONCHOCERCIASIS AND THE INTENSITY OF INFECTION IN THE COMMUNITY .4. THE DEGRADED FOREST OF SIERRA-LEONE
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND PARASITOLOGY
AB  - To assess the pattern of onchocercal ocular disease and blindness in south Sierra Leone, ophthalmological surveys were carried out in 13 highly infected villages located in various river basins. The most important finding was the blinding potential of onchocerciasis in the degraded forest area where the prevalence of onchocercal blindness reached levels of up to 6%. This is remarkable since previous studies have claimed onchocerciasis in the forest to cause little blindness. Ocular onchocerciasis undoubtedly constitutes a problem of public health importance in south Sierra Leone. The rates of onchocercal ocular disease and blindness, however, were significantly lower than those found in savanna villages with similar levels of endemicity. The community pattern of ocular onchocerciasis was not significantly different from the classical pattern in the forest but this could be explained by the low endemicity levels in the forest villages studied. It is therefore not possible to deduce from this study whether the pattern of ocular onchocerciasis in south Sierra Leone is of the forest type, or a pattern on its own

TI  - Serological evidence of DENV, JEV, and ZIKV among the indigenous people (Orang Asli) of Peninsular Malaysia
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), and Zika virus (ZIKV) are mosquito-borne flavivirus of medical importance in tropical countries such as Malaysia. However, much remains unknown regarding their prevalence among the underserved indigenous people (Orang Asli) living in communities in the forest fringe areas of Peninsular Malaysia. Information on the prevalence of diseases is necessary to elevate the effectiveness of disease control and preventive measures. This study aimed to determine the seroprevalence of the three major flaviviruses among the Orang Asli and investigate the association between demographic factors and seropositivities. Sampling activities were conducted in the Orang Asli villages to obtain serum samples and demographic data from consenting volunteers. The presence of DENV, JEV, and ZIKV immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies in the sera were examined using commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. A focus reduction neutralization assay was performed to measure virus-specific neutralizing antibodies. A total of 872 serum samples were obtained from the Orang Asli volunteers. Serological assay results revealed that DENV IgG, JEV IgG, and ZIKV IgG seropositivities among the Orang Asli were at 4.9%, 48.4%, and 13.2%, respectively. Neutralizing antibodies (FRNT50 >= 1:40) against JEV and ZIKV were found in 86.7% and 100.0%, respectively, out of the samples tested. Positive serology to all three viruses corresponded significantly to the age of the volunteers with increasing seropositivity in older volunteers. Findings from the study suggest that Orang Asli are at significant risk of contracting JEV and ZIKV infections despite the lack of active transmission of the viruses in the country.

TI  - A framework for establishing a rapid 'Ohi'a death resistance program
T2  - NEW FORESTS
AB  - Metrosideros polymorpha Gaud. ('ohi'a) is the most abundant native forest tree in Hawai'i and a keystone species of cultural, ecological, and economic importance. 'Ohi'a forests, particularly on HawaiModified Letter Turned Commai Island, are being severely impacted by Rapid 'Ohi'a Death (ROD), which is caused by the fungal pathogens Ceratocystis lukuohia and C. huliohia. ROD is characterized by branch dieback, crown wilting, and mortality. Initial disease resistance screening of four varieties of M. polymorpha with C. lukuohia demonstrated that varieties may differ in susceptibility. Several survivors of field or screening-based infections still exist, providing strong impetus for the establishment of the 'OhiModified Letter Turned Commaa Disease Resistance Program (Modified Letter Turned CommaODRP). Here, we outline a framework for guiding the Modified Letter Turned CommaODRP throughout the process of identifying and developing ROD resistance in M. polymorpha and, possibly, all Hawaiian Metrosideros species. Core Modified Letter Turned CommaODRP projects include: (1) evaluating and operationalizing methods for greenhouse-based production and screening of test plants; (2) greenhouse screening of seedlings and rooted cuttings sampled from native Metrosideros throughout HawaiModified Letter Turned Commai; (3) establishing field trials to validate results from greenhouse assays; (4) understanding environmental and genetic drivers of resistance to characterize the durability of resistance to ROD; (5) developing remote sensing and molecular methods to rapidly detect ROD-resistant individuals; and (6) conducting breeding trials to improve the degree and durability of ROD resistance. Ultimately, the Modified Letter Turned CommaODRP seeks to produce ROD-resistant material for the perpetuation of M. polymorpha across Hawai'i, with the goal of preserving the ecology, culture, and communities that are dependent on this tree species.

TI  - Transmission risk beyond the village: entomological and human factors contributing to residual malaria transmission in an area approaching malaria elimination on the Thailand-Myanmar border
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
AB  - BackgroundA mixed methods study was conducted to look at the magnitude of residual malaria transmission (RMT) and factors contributing to low (<1% prevalence), but sustained transmission in rural communities on the Thai-Myanmar border.MethodsA cross-sectional behaviour and net survey, observational surveys and entomological collections in both villages and forested farm huts frequented by community members for subsistence farming practices were conducted.ResultsCommunity members frequently stayed overnight at subsistence farm huts or in the forest. Entomological collections showed higher biting rates of primary vectors in forested farm hut sites and in a more forested village setting compared to a village with clustered housing and better infrastructure. Despite high levels of outdoor biting, biting exposure occurred predominantly indoors, particularly for non-users of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs). Risk of biting exposure was exacerbated by sub-optimal coverage of LLINs, particularly in subsistence farm huts and in the forest. Furthermore, early waking hours when people had left the safety of their nets coincided with peaks in biting in later morning hours.ConclusionsEntomological and epidemiological findings suggest drivers and modulators of sustained infection prevalence in the area to be: higher mosquito abundance in forested areas where LLINs were used less frequently or could not be used; late sleeping and waking times coinciding with peak biting hours; feeding preferences of Anopheles taking them away from contact with LLIN and indoor residual spraying (IRS), e.g. exophagy and zoophagy; non-use of LLIN and use of damaged/torn LLIN; high population movement across the border and into forested areas thereby increasing risk of exposure, decreasing use of protection and limiting access to healthcare; and, Plasmodium vivax predominance resulting in relapse(s) of previous infection. The findings highlight gaps in current intervention coverage beyond the village setting.

TI  - Spatial pattern assessment of dengue fever risk in subtropical urban environments: The case of Hong Kong
T2  - LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
AB  - Dengue fever, a mosquito-borne fatal disease, brings a huge health burden in tropical regions. With global warming, rapid urbanization and the expansion of mosquitoes, dengue fever is expected to spread to many subtropical regions, leading to increased potential health risks on local populations. So far, limited studies assessed the dengue fever risk spatially for subtropical non-endemic regions hindering the development of related public health management. Therefore, we proposed a spatial hazard-exposure-vulnerability assessment framework for mapping the dengue fever risk in Hong Kong. Firstly, the spatial distribution of the habitat suitability for Aedes albopictus, the mosquito proxy for the dengue fever hazard, was predicted using a species distribution model (e.g., MaxEnt) relying on a list of variables related to local climate, urban morphology, and landscape metrics. Secondly, the spatial autocorrelation between high dengue hazard and high human popula-tion exposure in urban areas was measured. Finally, the dengue fever risk was assessed at community scale by integrating the results of vulnerability analysis basing on census data. This approach allowed the identification of 17 high-risk spots within Hong Kong. The landscape metrics about land utilities and vegetations, and urban morphological characteristics are the influential factors on the spatial distribution of dengue vector. In addition, the underlying factors behind each hot spot were investigated, and specific suggestions for dengue prevention were proposed accordingly. The findings provide a useful reference for developing local dengue fever risk pre-vention measures, with the proposed method easily exportable to other high-density cities within subtropical Asia and elsewhere.

TI  - Mammals in Sao Paulo State: diversity, distribution, ecology, and conservation
T2  - BIOTA NEOTROPICA
AB  - Mammals are charismatic organisms that play a fundamental role in ecological functions and ecosy stem services, such as pollination, seed dispersal, nutrient cycling, and pest control. The state of Sao Paulo represents only 3% of the Brazilian territory but holds 33% of its mammalian diversity. Most of its territory is dominated by agriculture, pastures, and urban areas which directly affect the diversity and persistence of mammals in the landscape. In addition, Sao Paulo has the largest port in Latin America and the largest offshore oil reservoir in Brazil, with a 600 km stretch of coastline with several marine mammal species. These human-made infrastructures affect the diversity, distribution, ecology, and the future of mammals in the state. Here, we answer five main questions: 1) What is the diversity of wild mammals in Sao Paulo state? 2) Where are they? 3) What is their positive and negative impact on human well-being? 4) How do mammals thrive in human-modified landscapes? 5) What is the future of mammals in the state? The state of Sao Paulo holds 255 species of native mammals, with four endemic species, two of them globally endangered. At least six species (two marsupials, Giant otter, Pampas deer, Brazilian dwarf brocket deer, and Giant armadillo) were extirpated from the state due to hunting and habitat loss. The intense human land use in the state forced many mammalian species to change their diet to cope with the intense fragmentation and agriculture. Large-scale monoculture has facilitated the invasion of exotic species such as wild boars (javali) and the European hare. Several "savanna-dwelling" species are expanding their ranges (Maned wolf, Bracket deer) over deforested areas and probably reflect changes towards a drier climate. Because the state has the largest road system, about 40,000 mammals from 33 species are killed per year in collisions causing an economic loss of 12 million dollars/year. The diversity of mammals is concentrated in the largest forest remnants of Serra do Mar and in the interior of the State, mainly in the regions of Ribeirao Preto and Jundiai. Sampling gaps are concentrated throughout the interior of the state, particularly in the northwest region. Wild mammals play a fundamental role in many ecosystem services, but they can also be a concern in bringing new emergent diseases to humans. Although the taxonomy of mammals seems to be well known, we show that new species are continuously being discovered in the state. Therefore, continuous surveys using traditional and new technologies (eDNA, iDNA, drones), long-term population monitoring, investigation of the interface of human-wildlife conflict, and understanding of the unique ecosystem role played by mammals are future avenues for promoting sustainable green landscapes allied to human well-being in the state. The planting of forest or savanna corridors, particularly along with major river systems, in the plateau, controlling illegal hunting in the coastal areas, managing fire regimes in the Cerrado, and mitigating roadkill must be prioritized to protect this outstanding mammal diversity.

TI  - Assessing infestation risk by vectors - Spatial and temporal distribution of African ticks at the scale of a landscape
T2  - TROPICAL VETERINARY DISEASES: CONTROL AND PREVENTION IN THE CONTEXT OF THE NEW WORLD ORDER
CP  - 5th Biennial Conference of the Society-for-Tropical-Veterinary-Medicine
AB  - Control of major livestock diseases in the tropics, such as theileriosis or trypanosomosis, is still largely based on the control of their vectors. Understanding the distribution of vectors, such as ticks and tsetse flies, is needed in order to improve the efficiency and economical viability of control operations. Technical improvements such as remote sensing and global information systems have allowed valuable improvements for the prediction of large-scale vector distribution (continental to national), but trying to make these predictions at the scale of a landscape is facing other challenges. At this scale, an analysis of host/vector interactions with an evolutionary point of view is useful. A study was undertaken on a mixed game/cattle ranch in Zimbabwe during which we monitored variations in the abundance and spatial distribution of the immature free stages of Rhipicephalus appendiculatus/R. zambeziensis and R. e. evertsi,(1,2) two major groups of tick species in Southern Africa. We found two contrasting distributions in relation to contact between tick larvae. The ungulate-host R. e. evertsi appeared to be unpredictable, whereas R. appendiculatus/R. zambeziensis were predictable in time and space, but associated with key-resources for ungulates (water and forage resources). The consequences of such distributions are discussed in terms of vector control.

TI  - Analysis of electromagnetic wave propation in forest environment along multiple paths - Abstract
T2  - JOURNAL OF ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES AND APPLICATIONS
AB  - The electromagnetic radiation of an electric dipole in a medium with four layers is examined using dyadic Green's functions in their vector wave eigenfunction expansion forms. In this four-layered model, two lossy dielectric layers are used to represent the canopy and trunks of vegetation that covers the ground plane. The dyadic Green's functions for a four-layered medium are first applied to derive the integral expression of the electric fields. Asymptotic evaluations of the integrals are then made using the steepest descent method, and the branch-cut integrations in complex planes; and correspondingly the direct wave, multi-reflected waves, and lateral waves along various interfaces have been obtained. The far-zone field for problems of this nature is, as found, primarily determined by the lateral wave. The transmission losses for tropical forest are calculated numerically for both vertical and horizontal dipoles, and a dipole with a 45 degrees inclination. Also, a serious mistake made in the literature has been pointed out in this paper.

TI  - Evaluation of directional normalization methods for Landsat TM/ETM plus over primary Amazonian lowland forests
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
AB  - Biodiversity mapping in extensive tropical forest areas poses a major challenge for the interpretation of Landsat images, because floristically clearly distinct forest types may show little difference in reflectance. In such cases, the effects of the bidirectional reflection distribution function (BRDF) can be sufficiently strong to cause erroneous image interpretation and classification. Since the opening of the Landsat archive in 2008, several BRDF normalization methods for Landsat have been developed. The simplest of these consist of an empirical view angle normalization, whereas more complex approaches apply the semi-empirical Ross-Li BRDF model and the MODIS MCD43-series of products to normalize directional Landsat reflectance to standard view and solar angles. Here we quantify the effect of surface anisotropy on Landsat TMIETM-1-images over old-growth Amazonian forests, and evaluate five angular normalization approaches. Even for the narrow swath of the Landsat sensors, we observed directional effects in all spectral bands. Those normalization methods that are based on removing the surface reflectance gradient as observed in each image were adequate to normalize TIWETM+ imagery to nadir viewing, but Were less suitable for multitemporal analysis when the solar vector varied strongly among images. Approaches based on the MODIS BRDF model parameters successfully reduced directional effects in the visible bands, but removed only half of the systematic errors in the infrared bands. The best results were obtained when the semi-empirical BRDF model was calibrated using pairs of Landsat observation. This method produces a single set of BRDF parameters, which can then be used to operationally normalize Landsat TM/ETM+ imagery over Amazonian forests to nadir viewing and a standard solar configuration.

TI  - RNA-seq research landscape in Africa: systematic review reveals disparities and opportunities
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL RESEARCH
AB  - RNA sequencing has emerged as the standard method for transcriptome profiling of several human diseases. We performed a systematic review detailing the state of RNA-seq analyses in Africa from its inception till February 2022. Our goal was to provide an update on the state of RNA-seq analyses in Africa, including research gaps, funding information, participants information, authorship and collaborations. Following the PRISMA guidelines, we performed an exhaustive literature search for RNA-seq studies conducted in Africa, using PubMed, Scopus and Academic Search Complete (EBSCOhost). The output was exported to Endnote X9 for analyses. The initial literature search yielded 10,369 articles spread across PubMed (4916), Scopus (4847) and EBSCOhost (580). By applying our exclusion criteria, 28 full-text articles remained and were thoroughly analyzed. Overall, 17 human diseases were studied, including cancers (10/28), infectious disease (4/28), parasitic disease (4/28), autoimmune disorders (2/28) and neglected tropical diseases (2/28). Majority of the articles were published in PLoS Pathogens, BioMed Central and Nature. The National Institutes of Health (42.4%), the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (7.5%) and the Wellcome Trust (7.5%) were the top funders of the research studies. Eleven African countries contributed to the participant group, with 57% located in Eastern Africa, 23.1% from Western and 16.7% from Southern Africa. The extremely low number of RNA-seq research studies in Africa is worrying and calls for an immediate investment in research by the African governments. The funding agencies and institutional review boards should also ensure that African collaborators are treated equitably in the course of the research projects.

TI  - Prevalence and Diversity of Avian Haemosporidians May Vary with Anthropogenic Disturbance in Tropical Habitats in Myanmar
T2  - DIVERSITY-BASEL
AB  - Avian malaria and related haemosporidians (genera Haemoproteus, Plasmodium and Leucocytozoon) infect most clades of bird. Although these parasites are present in almost all continents, they have been irregularly studied across different geographical regions. Despite the high bird diversity in Asia, the diversity of avian haemosporidians in this region is largely unknown. Moreover, anthropogenic changes to habitats in tropical regions may have a profound impact on the overall composition of haemosporidian communities. Here we analyzed the diversity and host association of bird haemosporidians from areas with different degrees of anthropogenic disturbance in Myanmar, revealing an unexplored diversity of these parasites (27% of newly-discovered haemosporidian lineages, and 64% of new records of host-parasite assemblages) in these tropical environments. This newly discovered diversity will be valuable for detecting host range and transmission areas of haemosporidian parasites. We also found slightly higher haemosporidian prevalence and diversity in birds from paddy fields than in individuals from urban areas and hills, thus implying that human alteration of natural environments may affect the dynamics of vector-borne diseases. These outcomes provide valuable insights for biodiversity conservation management in threatened tropical ecosystems.

TI  - Roles of pathogens on replacement of tree seedlings in heterogeneous light environments in a temperate forest: a reciprocal seed sowing experiment
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
AB  - 1. In forest communities, the Janzen-Connell (J-C) hypothesis proposes that species diversity is maintained by non-competitive distance-and/or density-dependent seedling mortality caused by host-specific natural enemies. However, the effects of pathogen associations from nearby conspecifics versus heterospecifics remain unknown in spatially heterogeneous light environments.
   2. Seeds of hardwood species Cornus controversa (Cornus) and Prunus grayana (Prunus) were sown beneath 6-7 Cornus and Prunus adults in both the forest understory (FU) and in gaps (Gap) created by felling all woody vegetation near the focal adults. Seedling growth, mortality, killing agents (e.g. pathogens that cause damping-off and leaf diseases), and root infection by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) were investigated.
   3. We found strong habitat effects on the expression of soil fungi beneath both tree species. Seedling mortality caused by soil-borne damping-off pathogens was greater in FU than in Gap, and AMF infection, which enhanced relative seedling growth rate, was greater in Gap than in FU. Seedling mortality caused by damping-off pathogens did not differ between Cornus and Prunus seedlings beneath the adults of conspecific or heterospecific adults in both FU and Gap, suggesting little distance-dependence or host preference in the fungus.
   4. Beneath the adults of Cornus and Prunus, the most prevalent leaf diseases were zonate leaf blight and angular leaf spot caused by the airborne pathogenic fungi Haradamyces foliicola and Phaeoisariopsis pruni-grayanae, respectively. Although these pathogens attacked the seedlings of both species, conspecific seedlings (i.e. home) showed more severe leaf damage, earlier leaf shedding and/or less defensive behaviour (cell wall defence) relative to heterospecific seedlings (i.e. away), suggesting negative distance-dependent attack (i.e. host preference) for these leaf diseases. As a result, greater seedling mortality was observed for conspecific seedlings under both FU and Gap treatments.
   5. Synthesis. In the temperate forest, the J-C hypothesis is largely mediated through the strong negative influence of airborne leaf diseases rather than through soil-borne damping-off pathogens. We found that airborne diseases demonstrated distance-dependent host preferences, which led to greater conspecific seedling damage regardless of environmental light conditions.

TI  - Epidemiology of concomitant infections due to <i>Loa loa</i>, <i>Mansonella perstans</i> and <i>Onchocerca volvulus</i> in rain forest villages of Cameroon
T2  - MEDICAL MICROBIOLOGY AND IMMUNOLOGY
CP  - International Conference of the Bernhard-Nocht-Institute-for-Tropical-Medicine/UNDP/World Bank/WHO Special Program for Research and Training in Tropical Disease
AB  - An epidemiological survey was conducted in 16 remote villages of the rain forest of southern Cameroon to ascertain the prevalence and intensity of three species of filariae: Loa loa, Onchocerca volvulus, and Mansonella perstans. We examined 1458 individuals for blood-dwelling microfilariae and 1255 of these were also for the presence of palpable nodules. All the villages surveyed were found highly endemic for onchocerciasis and mansonellosis with prevalence ranging from 28.44% to 87.17% for O. volvulus and 52.48% to 100% for M. perstans. The intensities of infection were also found high for M. perstans with arithmetic means of microfilaremia ranging from 280.94 to 4947.57 mf/ml. The loiasis prevalence was relatively low with value from 2.22% to 19.23%. Males were found more infected than females for the three species of filariae, and the prevalence and intensities of microfilaremia vary differently in males and females at different ages. The three species of filariae displayed different degrees of association in the inhabitants with a low prevalence of co-occurrence between L. loa O. volvulus and between L. loa/M. perstans. In contrast, there was a high prevalence of co-occurrence between M. perstans and O. volvulus. The implications of the co-occurrence of the three species of filariae in the populations of these remote villages on the intervention programs based on mass treatment with mectizan are discussed.

TI  - Identification of Secondary Metabolites from the Mangrove-Endophyte <i>Lasiodiplodia iranensis</i> F0619 by UPLC-ESI-MS/MS
T2  - METABOLITES
AB  - Lasiodiplodia is a widely distributed fungal genus, frequently found in tropical and subtropical regions where it can cause disease in important crops. It represents a promising source of active secondary metabolites with uses in chemical, pharmaceutical, and agrochemical processes. In this study, the strain Lasiodiplodia iranensis F0619 was isolated from the mangrove Avicennia ger-minans, collected from Sarigua National Park in the Republic of Panama. Fractions of crude extract were analyzed by UPLC-ESI-MS/MS, and five compounds, previously reported from Lasiodiplodia genus were identified, including 11,12-didehydro-7-iso-jasmonic acid (1), 4,5-didehydro-7-iso-jasmonic acid (2), cyclo-(L-Leu-L-Pro) (3), jasmonate-threonine (4), and abscisic acid (5). We describe and analyze their MS/MS fragmentation patterns to confirm the compounds 'chemical structures.

TI  - Potential Hydroponics Systems for Seed Potato Production in Tropical Conditions
T2  - XXVIII INTERNATIONAL HORTICULTURAL CONGRESS ON SCIENCE AND HORTICULTURE FOR PEOPLE (IHC2010): INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON GREENHOUSE 2010 AND SOILLESS CULTIVATION
CP  - 28th International Horticultural Congress on Science and Horticulture for People (IHC) / International Symposium on Greenhouse and Soilless Cultivation / International Symposium on Advances in Ornamentals, Landscape and Urban Horticulture
AB  - In tropical conditions such as Brazil, depending on the local altitude, potatoes can be planted and harvested in every month of the year successively, which favors pest and disease incidence, especially aphids transmission viruses. Therefore, obtaining good yield depends on constant pest and disease control and quality potato seed acquisition. One of the main strategies to increase a healthier seed potato multiplication rate and production is the use of hydroponic systems, with or without substrates, in channels, pots or boxes. In 2005 and 2008, researches investigated several hydroponic systems with and without the use of substrates. In the hydroponic systems without substrate, the aeroponic system resulted in the highest multiplication rate, with 47 tubers plant(-1) compared to NFT and DFT, 35 and 37 tubers plant(-1), respectively. With the use of substrates, the pot system obtained better results, reaching 12 tubers plant(-1), followed by the capillary system and boxes, with 8 and 7 tubers plant(-1), respectively. Potato seed production was influenced by hydroponics systems. Among hydroponic systems with substrate, the pots were shown as the best option. However, higher yields were obtained in the hydroponics systems without substrate, with the aeroponic system that provided the best results.

TI  - Symbiotic N-2-fixation in tropical legume species growing at high geographic elevation
T2  - SYMBIOSIS
AB  - Thirteen nodulated suffructicose tropical legume species were collected during the rainy season in full sun-exposed areas of a tropical cloud forest, between 1,400 and 1,650 m above sea level. Annual rain fall averaged 1,080 mm, and the soil and air temperature were 25 degrees C and 22 degrees C, respectively. The soils were day-loan with poor drainage. According to vegetation inventories carried out in highland and lowland areas the tropical legumes were considered as opportunistic ecological generalist species capable to colonize areas of contrasting geographic elevation. Based on the values of the relative abundance of ureides (RAU), the highland species Chamaecrista patellaria, Aeschynomene brasiliana, Calopogonium mucunoides, Cuotalaria anagiroides, Desmodium barbatum, Indigofera lespedezioides, Stylosanthes leiocarpa, Vigna vexillata and Mimosa orthocarpa were categorized as good NZ-fixers (RAU>60%). Whereas, Calopogonium sp., Desmodium intortum and Indigofera suffructicosa behaved as intermediate NZ-fixers (RAU 30-59%). Low rates of N-2-fixation (RAU<30%) were detected only in individuals of Mimosa albida. These differences in RAU among the highland species were not correlated with any of the ultrastructural characteristics of nodule infected cells such as the presence of fibre-like structures in the peribacteroid space, number of peribacteroid units per 100 mm, shape of bacteroids, number of bacteroids per peribacteroid unit, or number of poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate grains per bacteroid. For all highland legume species the mean RAU value was significantly higher than the mean value reported for all lowland legumes. The enhanced symbiotic efficiency in highland species was a consequence of higher leaf non-structural carbohydrate content and a 2.2 fold increase and 1.7 fold reduction in the shoot ureide and nitrate content, respectively, when compared to values of lowland legumes. The higher ureide:nitrate ratio in highland legumes allowed the assumption that symbiotic N-2-fixation prevails above nitrate uptake under the favorable climatic conditions encountered by legumes at high geographic elevation.

TI  - A global rise in alluvial mining increases sediment load in tropical rivers
T2  - NATURE
AB  - Increasing gold and mineral mining activity in rivers across the global tropics has degraded ecosystems and threatened human health(1,2). Such river mineral mining involves intensive excavation and sediment processing in river corridors, altering river form and releasing excess sediment downstream(2). Increased suspended sediment loads can reduce water clarity and cause siltation to levels that may result in disease and mortality in fish(3,4), poor water quality5 and damage to human infrastructure(6). Although river mining has been investigated at local scales, no global synthesis of its physical footprint and impacts on hydrologic systems exists, leaving its full environmental consequences unknown. We assemble and analyse a 37-year satellite database showing pervasive, increasing river mineral mining worldwide. We identify 396 mining districts in 49 countries, concentrated in tropical waterways that are almost universally altered by mining-derived sediment. Of 173 mining-affected rivers, 80% have suspended sediment concentrations (SSCs) more than double pre-mining levels. In 30 countries in which mining affects large (>50 m wide) rivers, 23 +/- 19% of large river length is altered by mining-derived sediment, a globe-spanning effect representing 35,000 river kilometres, 6% (+/- 1% s.e.) of all large tropical river reaches. Our findings highlight the ubiquity and intensity of mining-associated degradation in tropical river systems.

TI  - Cannabinoids from inflorescences fractions of <i>Trema orientalis</i> (L.) Blume (Cannabaceae) against human pathogenic bacteria
T2  - PEERJ
AB  - Background. Cannabinoids; tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabidiol (CBD) and cannabinol (CBN), might show antibacterial activity. Trema orientalis is a species in the Cannabaceae that is closely related to Cannabis through plastome phylogenetic evidence. This species is widely distributed throughout tropical Asia and is used as traditional medicine, particularly for the treatment of infectious diseases. However, no studies on the antibacterial activity of cannabinoid-containing inflorescences extracts are available. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine cannabinoid content and antibacterial activity of inflorescences fractions from T. orientalis native to Thailand.
   Methods. We hypothesized that inflorescences from T. orientalis might display cannabinoids similar to Cannabis because of their close taxonomic relationship. We extracted the mature inflorescences and infructescence of T. orientalis in three disparate populations from different Thailand floristic regions. Extractions were subsequently partitioned into hydrophilic and lipophilic fractions using distilled water and chloroform. The lipophilic extracts were further fractionated by the column chromatography with gradient elution and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS). Characterized cannabinoids were used in bioassays with multidrug-resistance bacteria.
   Results. Lipophilic extracts and fractions of inflorescences from all Thailand floristic regions consistently displayed cannabinoids (THC, CBD and CBN) in various quantities. These extracts exhibited inhibitory activity for Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii strains with minimum inhibitory concentration values varying from 31.25 to 125 mg/mL.
   Conclusion. Our study is the first to report cannabinoid detection in extracts from inflorescences of T. orientalis, a species in the Cannabaceae. These extracts and their fractions containing cannabinoids showed pronounced antibacterial activity. The use of analytic methods also demonstrated reproducible cannabinoid extraction.

TI  - Ornithophilous canopy species in the Atlantic rain forest of southeastern Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF FIELD ORNITHOLOGY
AB  - In tropical ecosystems, birds play a relevant role in plant reproduction. Although hummingbirds are regarded as the most important vertebrate pollinators in the Neotropics, the possible role of perching birds as pollinators has been neglected. From 2003 to 2005, we observed 68 species of plants visited by birds in an Atlantic rainforest in southeastern Brazil, including three canopy species: Spirotheca rivieri (Malvaceae, Bombacoidea), Schwartzia brasiliensis (Marcgraviaceae), and Psittacanthus dichrous (Loranthaceae). Flowers of these three species were visited by 15 different species of perching birds and by hummingbirds. The flowers of these three plants are colorful, ranging from deep red or purple to orange. Spirotheca rivieri blooms during the austral winter and Schwartzia brasiliensis during the summer. The flowers of these two species produce copious amounts of dilute nectar in easily accessible structures and both species appear to depend primarily on perching birds as pollinators, with hummingbirds being secondary or minor pollen vectors. The tubular, narrow flowers of P. dichrous are produced during the austral summer and are visited primarily by hummingbirds. Perching birds also visit the flowers, but destroy them. Our results suggest that previous estimates of the number of perching birds that feed on nectar may be too low and that flowers pollinated by perching birds may be more common in the canopy of Neotropical forests than previously thought.

TI  - Nodular Worm Infections in Wild Non-human Primates and Humans Living in the Sebitoli Area (Kibale National Park, Uganda): Do High Spatial Proximity Favor Zoonotic Transmission?
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   Nodular Oesophagostomum genus nematodes are a major public health concern in some African regions because they can be lethal to humans. Their relatively high prevalence in people has been described in Uganda recently. While non-human primates also harbor Oesophagostomum spp., the epidemiology of this oesophagostomosis and the role of these animals as reservoirs of the infection in Eastern Africa are not yet well documented.
   Methodology/Principal Findings
   The present study aimed to investigate Oesophagostomum infection in terms of parasite species diversity, prevalence and load in three non-human primates (Pan troglodytes, Papio anubis, Colobus guereza) and humans living in close proximity in a forested area of Sebitoli, Kibale National Park (KNP), Uganda. The molecular phylogenetic analyses provided the first evidence that humans living in the Sebitoli area harbored O. stephanostomum, a common species in free-ranging chimpanzees. Chimpanzees were also infected by O. bifurcum, a common species described in human populations throughout Africa. The recently described Oesophagostomum sp. found in colobine monkeys and humans and which was absent from baboons in the neighboring site of Kanyawara in KNP (10 km from Sebitoli), was only found in baboons. Microscopic analyses revealed that the infection prevalence and parasite load in chimpanzees were significantly lower in Kanyawara than in Sebitoli, an area more impacted by human activities at its borders.
   Conclusions/Significance
   Three different Oesophagostomum species circulate in humans and non-human primates in the Sebitoli area and our results confirm the presence of a new genotype of Oesophagostomum recently described in Uganda. The high spatiotemporal overlap between humans and chimpanzees in the studied area coupled with the high infection prevalence among chimpanzees represent factors that could increase the risk of transmission for O. stephanostomum between the two primate species. Finally, the importance of local-scale research for zoonosis risk management is important because environmental disturbance and species contact can differ, leading to different parasitological profiles between sites that are close together within the same forest patches.

TI  - Research, inventiveness and biotechnological advances in the production of value-added alkaloids occurring in tropical species
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
AB  - Alkaloids are compounds with wide occurrence in plant species and have been used for thousands of years for medicinal purposes. Industries demand high amounts of these metabolites and their improved production has been achieved due to recent advances in biotechnological techniques. In order to verify the scenario of studies and innovation in alkaloids occurring in tropical species, we surveyed in the Scopus and Espacenet databases, all research papers and patents on this theme. Our survey highlighted that at least 109 families and 481 tropical species were examined for the presence of alkaloids in the last 24 years. In addition, we found that approximately 3,400 patents have been filed in the last 20 years. However, contributions from tropical countries are lower than those from countries outside the region. Finally, we highlight the effort within the most varied biotechnological approaches that have been used to produce and increase the concentration of alkaloids in tropical plants. Although many advances have been made in recent years, challenges such as elucidating pathways in different species, adapting new techniques, discovering new expression vectors with greater compatibility, and elicitation studies for the production of alkaloids in tropical plants still need to be resolved and discussed by the scientific community.

TI  - Seroprevalence of Zika Virus among Forest Fringe Communities in Peninsular Malaysia and Sabah: General Population-Based Study
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) has had a history in Malaysia since its first isolation in 1966. However, it is believed that the immunity status among forest fringe communities has been underreported. We conducted cross-sectional surveillance of forest fringe communities from 10 Orang Asli villages and their peripheral communities in Perak, Pahang, and Sabah in Malaysia. A total of 706 samples were collected from 2019 to 2020 and screened for ZIKV exposure using an anti-ZIKV IgG ELISA kit. A neutralization assay against ZIKV was used to confirm the reactive samples. The seroprevalence results reported from the study of this population in Malaysia were 21.0% (n = 148, 95% CI, 0.183-0.273) after confirmation with a foci reduction neutralization test. The presence of neutralizing antibodies provides evidence that the studied forest fringe communities in Malaysia have been exposed to ZIKV. Multivariate analysis showed that those older than 44 years and those with an education below the university level had been exposed significantly to ZIKV. In addition, higher seropositivity rates to ZIKV were also reported among secondary school students from Bentong (Pahang) and residents from Segaliud (Sabah). No associations were identified between Zika seropositivity and gender, household size, house radius to the jungle, and income level. The presence of neutralizing antibodies against ZIKV among the study population might indicate that the causative pathogen had already circulated widely in forest fringe regions. Intervention for vector control, protection from mosquito bites, and awareness improvement should be encouraged in this population.

TI  - Geographic variation in baseline innate immune function does not follow variation in aridity along a tropical environmental gradient
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Geographic variation in aridity determines environmental productivity patterns, including large-scale variability in pathogens, vectors and associated diseases. If disease risk decreases with increasing aridity and is matched by immune defense, we predict a decrease in innate immune function along a gradient of increasing aridity from the cool-wet forest to the hot-dry Sahel, from south to north in Nigeria. We sampled blood and measured five innate immune indices from 286 Common Bulbuls Pycnonotus barbatus between 6 and 13 degrees N. We sampled in the dry season; we resampled the first location (Jos) also as the last sample location to test temporal change in immune function. Immune indices did not decrease with aridity. One immune index, nitric oxide concentration showed a weak quadratic pattern. In Jos, ovotransferrin concentration, haemagglutination and haemolysis titres increased 12 weeks into the dry season, contrary to expectations that immune indices should decrease with increased dryness. In this tropical system, innate immune function does not decrease with increasing aridity but temporal factors within a location may influence immune function more strongly than spatial variation in aridity, suggesting that immune variation does not follow a simple environmental productivity pattern. Consequently, caution should probably be exercised in predicting effects of climate variability on immune function or disease risk.

TI  - Arboreality predicts <i>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</i> infection level in tropical direct-developing frogs
T2  - JOURNAL OF NATURAL HISTORY
AB  - Pathogen-mediated changes in host behaviour can result from hosts altering their habitat preferences. Although infection risk with pathogenic fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis in amphibians is associated with environments favouring its growth, the relationship with microhabitat use has not been examined. Here, we aim to determine if microhabitats used by frogs during their nocturnal activity predict B. dendrobatidis prevalence and infection intensity. Our focal host, Eleutherodactylus coqui, is a habitat generalist that uses multiple habitats from the forest floor to the canopy. We analysed data on B. dendrobatidis occurrence in 157 adults and 122 juveniles at El Yunque National forest in Puerto Rico. We categorized each individual's nocturnal microhabitat as forest floor, curled palm fronds in the floor, arboreal bromeliads and foliage or tree trunks 50 cm to 2.5 m above ground. We found that frogs on the forest floor had the greatest B. dendrobatidis prevalence (73%), compared with those active in vegetation above ground (55%). Overall, the probability of B. dendrobatidis infection in frogs using microhabitats on the forest floor was twice as great as for those on arboreal substrates. Differences in B. dendrobatidis prevalence and intensity in E. coqui may be explained by specific abiotic conditions of microenvironments (temperature and humidity) affecting both pathogen and host, and by the age-specific ecological requirements of hosts. Adults were found to be most active in microhabitats where individuals had lower infection burdens, suggesting pathogen-modulated habitat choice. This work has important implications for the evolutionary dynamics of enzootic diseases and provides data that may inform potential mitigation strategies against a generalist amphibian pathogen.

TI  - Dependence of the leopard <i>Panthera pardus fusca</i> in Jaipur, India, on domestic animals
T2  - ORYX
AB  - The ecology and predator-prey dynamics of large felids in the tropics have largely been studied in natural systems where wild ungulates constitute the majority of the prey base. However, in tropical countries where communities are primarily agrarian, the high density of domestic animals in human-dominated landscapes can be a potential prey source for large carnivores. We demonstrate almost complete dependence of the Vulnerable leopard Panthera pardus fusca in the Jhalana Reserve Forest in Jaipur, north-west India on domestic animals as prey. We analysed 132 leopard scats collected during the dry season of November 2017-April 2018. Domestic animals comprised the majority of the leopards' prey (89.5% frequency of occurrence): dogs Canis lupus familiaris (44%), cats Felis catus (13%), goats Capra aegagrus hircus (16%) and cattle Bos taurus (15%). Wild species, which occurred in the leopards' diet at a relatively low frequency, were rodents, the hare Lepus nigricollis, small Indian civet Viverricula indica, rhesus macaque Macaca mulatta, northern plains grey langur Semnopithecus entellus and mongoose Herpestes edwardsii. Diet is also a function of availability of potential prey, but no data are available on the density of the leopard's wild prey species in Jhalana Reserve Forest. Nevertheless, our results suggest that abundance of domestic prey around Jhalana Reserve Forest sustains the c. 25 known leopards. We conclude that these leopards, by preying on feral dogs in an urban environment, could be considered as suppliers of a service to the human population amongst whom they thrive, although this potentially exposes the leopards to the canine distemper virus.

TI  - Effects of Land Use on Plague (<i>Yersinia pestis</i>) Activity in Rodents in Tanzania
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Understanding the effects of land-use change on zoonotic disease risk is a pressing global health concern. Here, we compare prevalence of Yersinia pestis, the etiologic agent of plague, in rodents across two land-use types agricultural and conserved in northern Tanzania. Estimated abundance of seropositive rodents nearly doubled in agricultural sites compared with conserved sites. This relationship between land-use type and abundance of seropositive rodents is likely mediated by changes in rodent and flea community composition, particularly via an increase in the abundance of the commensal species, Mastomys natalensis, in agricultural habitats. There was mixed support for rodent species diversity negatively impacting Y. pestis seroprevalence. Together, these results suggest that land-use change could affect the risk of local transmission of plague, and raise critical questions about transmission dynamics at the interface of conserved and agricultural habitats. These findings emphasize the importance of understanding disease ecology in the context of rapidly proceeding landscape change.

TI  - <i>Colletotrichum theobromicola</i> causes defoliation, stem girdling and death of mini-cuttings of eucalyptus in Brazil
T2  - TROPICAL PLANT PATHOLOGY
AB  - Eucalyptus plantations cover approximately 5.1 million hectares of Brazil, an area that will likely increase given the demand for natural products from planted forests. In recent years, anthracnose diseases have been frequently found on eucalyptus in Brazilian nurseries. In 2012, rooted mini-cuttings of clones of E. urophylla x E. grandis ("urograndis") exhibiting leaf spot and stem girdling symptoms were collected from nurseries in the Brazilian states of Par and Minas Gerais, and cultures of Colletotrichum were obtained from the lesions. The isolates were initially identified to species of the C. gloeosporioides species complex, according to searches of the Q-bank Fungi database with the DNA sequences of their internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions. Subsequent phylogenetic analysis of the beta-tubulin (TUB2) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) regions, combined with morphological characterization, allowed us to conclude that the fungus belongs to C. theobromicola. Conidial suspension sprayed on "urograndis" clone plants induced similar symptoms as those found under natural conditions. Re-isolation of the fungus from symptomatic plants fulfilled the Koch's postulate. To our knowledge, this is the first report of C. theobromicola in Brazil.

TI  - <i>Teratosphaeria pseudoeucalypti</i>, new cryptic species responsible for leaf blight of <i>Eucalyptus</i> in subtropical and tropical Australia
T2  - PLANT PATHOLOGY
AB  - Sub-tropical and tropical plantations of Eucalyptus grandis hybrids in eastern Australia have been severely affected by anamorphs of Teratosphaeria (formerly Kirramyces) causing a serious leaf blight disease. Initially the causal organism in Queensland, Australia, was identified as Teratosphaeria eucalypti, a known leaf parasite of endemic Eucalyptus spp. However, some inconsistencies in symptoms, damage and host range suggested that the pathogen in Queensland may be a new species. Isolates of T. eucalypti from throughout its known endemic range, including Queensland and New Zealand, where it is an exotic pathogen, were compared using multiple gene phylogenies. Phylogenetic studies revealed that the species responsible for leaf blight in Queensland represents a new taxon, described here as Teratosphaeria pseudoeucalypti. While the DNA sequence of T. pseudoeucalypti was more similar to T. eucalypti, the symptoms and cultural characteristics resembled that of T. destructans. The impact of this disease in central Queensland has increased annually and is the major threat to the eucalypt plantation industry in the region.

TI  - The yeast community and mycocin producers of guava fruit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
T2  - MYCOLOGIA
AB  - Two hundred and fifty-seven strains belonging to 28 ascomycetous yeast species were isolated from fallen guava fruit (Psidium guajava) from an Atlantic forest and a rural area in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The most frequent species were Kloeckera africana, K. apis, Pichia kluyveri and P. membranifaciens. Issatchenkia sp A and Issatchenkia sp B, two probable new species were also isolated in a high frequency at the forest site. Mycocinogenic yeasts (killer yeasts) with narrow killing spectra were represented by Candida diddensiae-like, C. diversa, C. stellata, I. terricola, K. africana, K. lindneri, P. kluyveri, P. membranifaciens and Torulaspora delbrueckii. The yeasts front tropical guava fruit have very similar physiological profiles that could have converged in response to host chemistry and vectors.

TI  - Malaria infection severity and mortality according to geographical and human environmental factors
T2  - MEDECINE ET MALADIES INFECTIEUSES
CP  - 6th Colloque on the Epidemiological Control of Infectious Diseases
AB  - Clinical aspects and malarial infection severity are linked to Plasmodial strains, parasite load, and immune response of the infected subjects. The environment influences the conditions of contamination and the level of specific susceptibility. Environmental factors such as biogeography govern epidemiological patterns of malaria which call be modified by local conditions such as landscape, climate changes, natural disasters, and, most important, human-related activities such as urbanization, deforestation, migration of workers or refugees, Malaria severity is also related to the socio-economic level of infected populations and endemic countries as shown by border countries with different gross national product per inhabitant (i.e. Congo versus Zaire, Brazilian states of Amazon versus French Guyana, Comore Island versus Mayotte...). In non endemic countries with an equivalent socio-economical level, severity of imported malaria is related to the status of travellers, to the tropical destination, and to competency of local physicians.

TI  - Climate, Landscape, and the Risk of Orbivirus Exposure in Cattle in Illinois and Western Indiana
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Climate and environmental data were used to estimate the risk of testing positive for antibodies to bluetongue (BTV) and epizootic hemorrhagic disease viruses (EHDV) in cattle in Illinois and western Indiana over three transmission seasons (2000-2002). The risks of BTV and EHDV seropositivity were positively associated with temperature during every year of the study. The EHDV seropositivity was also positively associated with forest patchiness in two of the years. During 2002, a year with unusually high spring rainfall, forest patchiness was not significantly associated with EHDV but spring rainfall did have a moderating effect on temperature. Maps of predicted probability of exposure to BTV or EHDV were created using these best-fitting models and show distinctly different spatial patterns within the same cattle population.

T2  - ALGORITHMS AND TECHNOLOGIES FOR MULTISPECTRAL, HYPERSPECTRAL, AND ULTRASPECTRAL IMAGERY XXI
CP  - Conference on Algorithms and Technologies for Multispectral, Hyperspectral, and Ultraspectral Imagery XXI
AB  - Hyperspectral images are an important tool to assess ecosystem biodiversity. To obtain more precise analysis of biodiversity indicators that agree with indicators obtained using field data, analysis of spectral diversity calculated from images have to be validated with field based diversity estimates. The plant species richness is one of the most important indicators of biodiversity. This indicator can be measured in hyperspectral images considering the Spectral Variation Hypothesis (SVH) which states that the spectral heterogeneity is related to spatial heterogeneity and thus to species richness. The goal of this research is to capture spectral heterogeneity from hyperspectral images for a terrestrial neo tropical forest site using Vector Quantization (VQ) method and then use the result for prediction of plant species richness. The results are compared with that of Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC). The validation of the process index is done calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient between the Shannon entropy from actual field data and the Shannon entropy computed in the images. One of the advantages of developing more accurate analysis tools would be the extension of the analysis to larger zones. Multispectral image with a lower spatial resolution has been evaluated as a prospective tool for spectral diversity.

TI  - Dictyostelids from aerial "canopy soil" microhabitats
T2  - FUNGAL ECOLOGY
AB  - The leaf litter decomposition zone of forest soils is generally considered as the primary microhabitat for dictyostelid cellular slime molds (dictyostelids), but these organisms also occur in other types of soils and are sometimes coprophilous. The occurrence of dictyostelids in aerial microhabitats has received relatively little study. However, they can be surprisingly abundant in the mantle of dead organic matter (literally a "canopy soil") often found at the bases of epiphytes that grow on the larger branches and trunks of trees in moist temperate and tropical forests. More than 400 samples collected from the canopy soil microhabitat in 11 localities in several different regions of the world yielded at least 37 species of dictyostelids. Some of the species recovered from canopy soil have been described as new to science, and three of these are not yet known from ground soil. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd and The British Mycological Society.

TI  - Evaluation of onchocerciasis control in the Upper Denkyira East municipal in the forest area of Ghana: Responses of participants and distributors to the CDTI programme
T2  - ACTA TROPICA
AB  - The African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control (APOC), which focused on annual mass treatment with ivermectin, was launched in 1995 and was replaced by the Expanded Special Project for Neglected Tropical Diseases (ESPEN) by the end of 2015. In Ghana, the Community Directed Treatment with Ivermectin (CDTI) was introduced in 1999. After a decade, biannual reinforcement was introduced during which the Ghana Health Service (GHS) recorded coverage rates through routine data collection. Transmission studies conducted in the Upper Denkyira East Municipal (UDEM) of the forest zone of Ghana in 2002 and 2006 had shown that annual treatments with ivermectin had hardly any effect on the transmission of Onchocerca volvulus by the vector Simulium sanctipauli. In order to establish whether or not this was due to an insufficient compliance to the CDTI programme, an additional questionnaire survey was carried out in 2013 following those conducted in 2002 and 2006. The repeat transmission survey conducted in 2013 in the same area revealed that the vector S. sanctipauli had apparently disappeared from the rivers Ofin and Pra due to gold mining activities. In 2006 and 2013, we conducted surveys using structured questionnaires to address issues related to compliance and to compare results on the effectiveness of CDTI. A total of 692 individuals from 7 villages and 447 individuals from 9 villages were interviewed in 2006 and 2013 respectively. Questions asked included whether or not they had taken the ivermectin and reasons for not doing so when that was the case. Results were compared with the previous investigations conducted in 2002. Whereas official reported coverage rates ranged from 59 to 85% in 2006 and from 88 to 97% in 2013, compliance rates decreased from 36% in 2006 to 21% in 2013. Factors affecting compliance included fear of unpleasant side effects (pruritus and oedema), which decreased from 36% to 21% for the same period. Lack of awareness of CDTI sharply increased from 12% to 46% for the same period. Participants believed that treatments were no longer necessary due to the absence of vectors observed in 2013. There seems to be a considerable difference between coverage and compliance rates in the study communities. The difference can be attributed to the performance of the Community-Directed Distributors (CDDs) and the absence of the vector population observed in 2013. Discussions with CDDs suggested that factors that led to noncompliance were mostly side effects, unawareness of the disease by immigrants and lack of financial motivation for the CDDs. Also included was the fact that they needed to complete distribution of the drugs in the entire village, covering all households within just one week irrespective of the size of the catchment area. This, they thought was too much work for a short period of time. We propose to intensify the training of CDDs by the national Neglected Tropical Diseases Programme (NTDP) and to include the Community-based Health and Planning Services (CHPS) concept into onchocerciasis control efforts for awareness creation while the vector population and the transmission should be further monitored. The population should be made aware that the side effects they experienced from previous treatments or had heard about had reduced significantly. They also should be in the known that vector flies may return and so the risk of transmission remains.

TI  - Atlantic Forest Malaria: A Review of More than 20 Years of Epidemiological Investigation
T2  - MICROORGANISMS
AB  - In the south and southeast regions of Brazil, cases of malaria occur outside the endemic Amazon region near the Atlantic Forest in some coastal states, where Plasmodium vivax is the recognized parasite. Characteristics of cases and vectors, especially Anopheles (Kerteszia) cruzii, raise the hypothesis of a zoonosis with simians as reservoirs. The present review aims to report on investigations of the disease over a 23-year period. Two main sources have provided epidemiological data: the behavior of Anopheles vectors and the genetic and immunological aspects of Plasmodium spp. obtained from humans, Alouatta simians, and Anopheles spp. mosquitoes. Anopheles (K.) cruzii is the most captured species in the forest canopy and is the recognized vector. The similarity between P. vivax and Plasmodium simium and that between Plasmodium malariae and Plasmodium brasilianum shared between simian and human hosts and the involvement of the same vector in the transmission to both hosts suggest interspecies transfer of the parasites. Finally, recent evidence points to the presence of Plasmodium falciparum in a silent cycle, detected only by molecular methods in asymptomatic individuals and An. (K.) cruzii. In the context of malaria elimination, it is paramount to assemble data about transmission in such non-endemic low-incidence areas.

TI  - Diversity of entomopathogenic fungi near leaf-cutting ant nests in a neotropical forest, with particular reference to <i>Metarhizium anisopliae</i> var. <i>anisopliae</i>
T2  - JOURNAL OF INVERTEBRATE PATHOLOGY
AB  - We investigated the prevalence of entomopathogenic fungi associated with leaf-cutting ant colonies in a small area of tropical forest in Panama. There was a high abundance of Metarhizium anisopliae var. anisopliae near the colonies. Beauveria bassiana was also detected in the soil, Aspergillus flavus in dump material, and six Camponotus atriceps ants were found infected with Cordyceps sp.. Based on a partial sequence of the IGS region, almost all of the M. anisopliae var. anisopliae isolates fell within one of the three main clades of M. anisopliae var. anisopliae, but with there still being considerable diversity within this clade. The vast majority of leaf-cutting ants collected were not infected by any entomopathogenic fungi. While leaf-cutting ants at this site must, therefore, regularly come into contact with a diversity of entomopathogenic fungi, they do not appear to be normally infected by them.

TI  - International modified Delphi study on malaria preventive behaviour: new themes, contexts and framework for future research on <i>Plasmodium knowlesi</i> malaria
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - IntroductionPlasmodium knowlesi malaria is a non-human simian malaria that threatens Southeast Asian rural communities. Studies indicate that non-compliant bednet usage, travelling into the forest and working as farmers and rubber tappers put communities at risk for infection. Despite guidelines, malaria incidence increases yearly and has become a public health concern. In addition to research gaps addressing factors that influence malaria prevention behaviour in these communities, there are no specific guidelines to facilitate strategies against the threat of P. knowlesi malaria. MethodTo examine potential factors that influence malaria-prevention behaviour in communities exposed to P. knowlesi malaria, 12 malaria experts participated in a modified Delphi study; every participant maintained their anonymity throughout the study. Three Delphi rounds were conducted via different online platforms between 15 November 2021 and 26 February 2022, and consensus was achieved when 70% of the participants agreed on a particular point with a 4-5 median. The results from the open-ended questions were then subjected to thematic analysis, and the dataset generated by this study was analysed using a deductive and inductive approach. ResultsAfter a systematic, iterative process, knowledge and belief, social support, cognitive and environmental factors, past experience as a malaria patient, and the affordability and feasibility of a given intervention were critical contributors to malaria-prevention behaviour. ConclusionFuture research on P. knowlesi malaria could adapt this study's findings for a more nuanced understanding of factors that influence malaria-prevention behaviour and improve P. knowlesi malaria programmes based on the expert consensus.

TI  - Identification of the Tembusu Virus in Mosquitoes in Northern Thailand
T2  - VIRUSES-BASEL
AB  - Among emerging zoonotic pathogens, mosquito-borne viruses (MBVs) circulate between vertebrate animals and mosquitoes and represent a serious threat to humans via spillover from enzootic cycles to the human community. Active surveillance of MBVs in their vectors is therefore essential to better understand and prevent spillover and emergence, especially at the human-animal interface. In this study, we assessed the presence of MBVs using molecular and phylogenetic methods in mosquitoes collected along an ecological gradient ranging from rural urbanized areas to highland forest areas in northern Thailand. We have detected the presence of insect specific flaviviruses in our samples, and the presence of the emerging zoonotic Tembusu virus (TMUV). Reported for the first time in 1955 in Malaysia, TMUV remained for a long time in the shadow of other flaviviruses such as dengue virus or the Japanese encephalitis virus. In this study, we identified two new TMUV strains belonging to cluster 3, which seems to be endemic in rural areas of Thailand and highlighted the genetic specificities of this Thai cluster. Our results show the active circulation of this emerging flavivirus in Thailand and the need for continuous investigation on this poorly known but threatening virus in Asia.

TI  - Haemosporidian prevalence, parasitaemia and aggregation in relation to avian assemblage life history traits at different elevations
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY
AB  - The transmission of vector-borne protozoa such as parasites of the Order Haemosporida is dependent on both biotic and abiotic factors such as host life history traits and environmental conditions. This study aimed to identify the variables that determine haemosporidian prevalence, parasitaemia and aggregation within the context of elevation and avian life history traits in Central Veracruz, Mexico. We sampled 607 birds from 88 species; we used microscopy and the mtDNA cytochrome b gene to detect parasites. We found an overall prevalence of 32.3%. Haemosporidian prevalence was 21.6% in tropical sub-deciduous forest (at sea level), 38% in tropical deciduous forest (265 m above sea level (asl)), 19.4% in montane cloud forest (1630 m asl), and 51.7% in pine-oak forest (2790 m asl). The prevalence of each parasite genus was strongly influenced by elevation (a proxy of habitat type). Plasmodium showed the highest prevalence at low elevation. Haemoproteus increased in prevalence with elevation. Leucocytozoon displayed the highest prevalence at the highest elevation (pine-oak forest). Haemoproteus spp. and Leucocytozoon spp. prevalences were higher in open cup than in closed nests. Haemoproteus prevalence and haemosporidian parasitaemia were lower in solitary birds than birds with pairing and gregarious behavior. Haemosporidian aggregation decreased with elevation, yielding the significantly lowest values at the pine-oak forest. Elevation distribution patterns of prevalence for each genus were similar to those previously reported in other geographical areas (e.g., South America, Europe).

TI  - Spotlight on <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> evolutionary system in the southeastern Atlantic forest
T2  - BIOTA NEOTROPICA
AB  - Malaria elimination is now set to occur in Brazil until 2030. While this achievement is feasible, as it is for other endemic regions worldwide, it is important to recognize resistance of parasites and vectors against anti-malarial interventions. Resistance against drugs and insecticides can lead to discontinuities of malaria transmission, known as residual malaria transmission. Herein, we described a novel phenomenon that is occurring in a residual malaria transmission scenario in the southeastern Atlantic forest. This novel phenomenon does not belong to what is known and therefore we decided to explain it based on an evolutionary perspective. Although it shall not be viewed as a threat to public health, the phenomenon has important aspects that should be highlighted. Specifically, it represents an adaptation of P. falciparum among vectors and hosts in the southeastern Atlantic forest. Knowledge about this phenomenon could be of importance, including to the on-going malaria elimination programs.

TI  - Small mammal assemblages and their ectoparasite prevalence (Acarina) in mangrove forests of Peninsular Malaysia
T2  - TROPICAL ZOOLOGY
AB  - The mangrove forest is located in the coastal intertidal zone and plays a vital role in buffering against erosion from storm surges, currents, waves, and tides. This ecosystem also serves for ecotourism due to its heterogeneous habitats, which supported a high diversity of plants and animals. Small mammals are among the abundant but poorly recognised inhabitants in mangrove forests. Apart from their role as primary consumer and prey, they are host to various ectoparasites, which potentially become the primary vector for tick-borne diseases among visitors. Therefore, this study aims to determine the small mammal assemblages and their ectoparasite prevalence in mangroves forests of Peninsular Malaysia. The capture-release method was applied for small mammal sampling, and each captured individual was screened and collected for ectoparasites before released. DNA barcoding using CO1 genes was performed for small mammal species verification, whereby ectoparasite identification was based on morphological identification and molecular verification using 16S rDNA genes. A total of 94 small mammals from 6 species were captured across sites, dominated by Rattus tiomanicus (n=74). From this number, 15 individuals (16% prevalence) were infested by ticks, 22 individuals (23%) were infested by mites, whereas 4 individuals (4%) were infested by both ticks and mites. Five species of ticks and one mite species were Dermacentor auratus, Dermacentor atrosignatus, and Laelaps echidninus. This study reveals a relatively poor diversity of small mammals in the mangroves forest, of which highly infested with a diversity of ectoparasites, elucidating the relationship of hostectoparasite associations in the riparian zone. This information is crucial to inform visitors to these areas, ultimately safeguard against ectoparasite-borne disease.

TI  - Characterization of chloroplast region <i>rrn16-rrn23S</i> from the tropical timber tree <i>Cedrela odorata</i> L. and <i>de novo</i> construction of a transplastomic expression vector suitable for Meliaceae trees and other economically important crops
T2  - GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH
AB  - The forest tree Spanish cedar (Cedrela odorata L.) is well-known for its high-value timber; however, this species is attacked by the shoot borer (Hypsipyla grandella) during its early years of development, resulting in branched stems and making the plants useless for high-quality wood production. The generation of resistant varieties expressing entomotoxic proteins may be an alternative to pesticide treatments. The use of plastid transformation rather than nuclear transformation should be used because it reduces the risk of transgene dissemination by pollen. Chloroplast transformation vectors require an expression cassette flanked by homologous plastid sequences to drive plastome recombination. Thus, Cedrela odorata plastome sequences are a prerequisite. The rrn16-rrn23 plastome region was selected, cloned, and characterized. When the sequence identity among the rrn16-rrn23 regions from Cedrela odorata and Nicotiana tabacum was compared, 3 inDels of 240, 104, and 39 bp were found that might severely affect transformation efficiency. Using this region, a new transformation vector was developed using pUC19 as a backbone by inserting the rrn16-trnI and trnA-rrn23 sequences from Cedrela odorata and adding 2 independent expression cassettes into the trnI-trnA intergenic region, conferring spectinomycin resistance, the ability to express the gfp reporter gene, and a site that can be used to express any other gene of interest.

TI  - Anthropogenic disturbance favours generalist over specialist parasites in bird communities: Implications for risk of disease emergence
T2  - ECOLOGY LETTERS
AB  - Niche theory predicts specialists which will be more sensitive to environmental perturbation compared to generalists, a hypothesis receiving broad support in free-living species. Based on their niche breadth, parasites can also be classified as specialists and generalists, with specialists infecting only a few and generalists a diverse array of host species. Here, using avian haemosporidian parasites infecting wild bird populations inhabiting the Western Ghats, India as a model system, we elucidate how climate, habitat and human disturbance affects parasite prevalence both directly and indirectly via their effects on host diversity. Our data demonstrate that anthropogenic disturbance acts to reduce the prevalence of specialist parasite lineages, while increasing that of generalist lineages. Thus, as in free-living species, disturbance favours parasite communities dominated by generalist versus specialist species. Because generalist parasites are more likely to cause emerging infectious diseases, such biotic homogenisation of parasite communities could increase disease emergence risk in the Anthropocene.

TI  - Mosquito community structure in contrasting anthropized landscapes in the Kumasi Metropolis of Ghana
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TROPICAL INSECT SCIENCE
AB  - Mosquito community dynamics is affected by several factors including land use types, physico-chemical parameters and heavy metal content of breeding sites. Although critical for effective vector control and disease prevention, information about the effect of anthropized landscapes and concomitant environmental parameters on mosquito community structure is limited. This study assessed the mosquito community structure in two anthropogenically-modified landscapes (auto-mechanic industrial and residential) in Ghana and the factors influencing them. Mosquito larvae sampled from the study area were enumerated and reared to the adult stage. Physico-chemical characteristics and heavy metal concentrations of water samples from the breeding sites were also determined. Nonmetric multi-dimensional scaling (NMDS) ordinations, permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) and redundancy analysis (RDA) were conducted to determine the pattern and variability of species composition and environmental factors that influence mosquito species distribution. Six mosquito species (Anopheles gambiae sensu lato, Anopheles funestus, Aedes aegypti, Culex quinquefasciatus, Culex decens and Mansonia sp.) were sampled from the residential area, while the same species except An. funestus and Mansonia sp. were found in the industrial area. The industrial area supported significantly higher mosquito numbers. Salinity, pH, Cu, Fe, Zn, Pb, electrical conductivity, Total Dissolved Solids, turbidity, and temperature of the breeding water related positively with Cx. quinquefaciatus, Cx decens and Mansonia sp. and negatively with Ae. aegypti, An. funestus and An. gambiae s. l. The study revealed the importance of landscape modification and environmental factors on mosquito community structure and the need to employ strategies aimed at eliminating man-made mosquito breeding sites.

TI  - The Influence of Habitat on Viral Diversity in Neotropical Rodent Hosts
T2  - VIRUSES-BASEL
AB  - Rodents are important reservoirs of numerous viruses, some of which have significant impacts on public health. Ecosystem disturbances and decreased host species richness have been associated with the emergence of zoonotic diseases. In this study, we aimed at (a) characterizing the viral diversity in seven neotropical rodent species living in four types of habitats and (b) exploring how the extent of environmental disturbance influences this diversity. Through a metagenomic approach, we identified 77,767 viral sequences from spleen, kidney, and serum samples. These viral sequences were attributed to 27 viral families known to infect vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, and amoeba. Viral diversities were greater in pristine habitats compared with disturbed ones, and lowest in peri-urban areas. High viral richness was observed in savannah areas. Differences in these diversities were explained by rare viruses that were generally more frequent in pristine forest and savannah habitats. Moreover, changes in the ecology and behavior of rodent hosts, in a given habitat, such as modifications to the diet in disturbed vs. pristine forests, are major determinants of viral composition. Lastly, the phylogenetic relationships of four vertebrate-related viral families (Polyomaviridae, Flaviviridae, Togaviridae, and Phenuiviridae) highlighted the wide diversity of these viral families, and in some cases, a potential risk of transmission to humans. All these findings provide significant insights into the diversity of rodent viruses in Amazonia, and emphasize that habitats and the host's dietary ecology may drive viral diversity. Linking viral richness and abundance to the ecology of their hosts and their responses to habitat disturbance could be the starting point for a better understanding of viral emergence and for future management of ecosystems.

TI  - Association of rodent-borne Leptospira spp. with urban environments in Malaysian Borneo
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Although leptospirosis is traditionally considered a disease of rural, agricultural and flooded environments, Leptospira spp. are found in a range of habitats and infect numerous host species, with rodents among the most significant reservoirs and vectors. To explore the local ecology of Leptospira spp. in a city experiencing rapid urbanization, we assessed Leptospira prevalence in rodents from three locations in Malaysian Borneo with differing levels of anthropogenic influence: 1) high but stable influence (urban); 2) moderate yet increasing (developing); and 3) low (rural). A total of 116 urban, 122 developing and 78 rural rodents were sampled, with the majority of individuals assigned to either the Rattus rattus lineage R3 (n = 165) or Sundamys muelleri (n = 100). Leptospira spp. DNA was detected in 31.6% of all rodents, with more urban rodents positive (44.8%), than developing (32.0%) or rural rodents (28.1%), and these differences were statistically significant. The majority of positive samples were identified by sequence comparison to belong to known human pathogens L. interrogans (n = 57) and L. borgpetersenii (n = 38). Statistical analyses revealed that both Leptospira species occurred more commonly at sites with higher anthropogenic influence, particularly those with a combination of commercial and residential activity, while L. interrogans infection was also associated with low forest cover, and L. borgpetersenii was more likely to be identified at sites without natural bodies of water. This study suggests that some features associated with urbanization may promote the circulation of Leptospira spp., resulting in a potential public health risk in cities that may be substantially underestimated.
   Author summary Leptospirosis is a significant zoonotic disease that is found in a range of environments worldwide, most notably tropical regions prone to flooding. The bacterial agents of this disease, Leptospira spp., are most often associated with rodents, including species frequently found in urban areas. In cities, rodent populations are often larger and denser than those found in natural environments, which can lead to higher rates of contact with people and impact human disease risk. To investigate the impacts of urbanization on Leptospira spp., we sampled rodents at locations with differing levels of human influence, from highly urbanized to rural, surrounding a city in Malaysian Borneo. We found that 31.6% of all rodents were positive for Leptospira spp. DNA, and that two primary species were present, L. interrogans and L. borgpetersenii, both of which are known human pathogens. Statistical analyses revealed that infected animals were more common in areas with higher levels of human influence, and were more likely to occur at sites with limited forest cover, and mixed commercial and residential activity. Our study adds to a growing body of evidence suggesting that there is a significant yet underappreciated risk of leptospirosis for people living in urban environments.

TI  - Species diversity of pathogenic wood-rotting fungi (Agaricomycetes, Basidiomycota) in China
T2  - MYCOLOGY-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON FUNGAL BIOLOGY
AB  - Wood-rotting basidiomycetes have been investigated in the Chinese forest ecosystem for the past 30 years. Two hundred and five pathogenic wood-decayers belonging to 9 orders, 30 families, and 74 genera have been found in Chinese native forests, plantations, and gardens. Seventy-two species (accounting for 35% of the total pathogenic species) are reported as pathogenic fungi in China for the first time. Among these pathogens, 184 species are polypores, nine are corticioid fungi, eight are agarics and five are hydnoid basidiomycetes. One hundred and seventy-seven species (accounting for 86%) cause white rot, while 28 species (accounting for 14%) result in brown rot; 157 species grow on angiosperm trees (accounting for 76.5%) and 44 species occur on gymnosperm trees (accounting for 21.5%), only four species inhabit both angiosperms and gymnosperms (accounting for 2%); 95 species are distributed in boreal to temperate forests and 110 in subtropical to tropical forests. In addition, 17 species, including Fomitopsis pinicola, Heterobasidion parviporum, and Phellinidium weirii etc. which were previously treated as pathogenic species in China, do not occur in China according to recent studies. In this paper, the host(s), type of forest, rot type, and distribution of each pathogenic species in China are given.

TI  - Imported Dengue Fever An Important Reemerging Disease
T2  - PEDIATRIC EMERGENCY CARE
AB  - Fever in a returned traveler from the tropics often poses a diagnostic challenge to the emergency department physician because of the potential for serious morbidity and mortality associated with certain infections such as falciparum malaria and dengue. We report a case of imported dengue fever in a 15-year-old adolescent boy acquired during a recent travel to Guatemala. Dengue fever is a mosquito-transmitted viral infection of global importance. The majority of US residents with dengue become infected during travel to tropical areas. In recent years, dengue has remerged in US tropical and subtropical areas. The disease is underreported in the United States along the Mexican border. The epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, control, and prevention of this important global reemerging infectious disease are reviewed. Clinicians should include dengue in the differential diagnosis of febrile illness in children who have recently returned from dengue endemic areas.

TI  - Study protocol: an open-label individually randomised controlled trial to assess the efficacy of artemether-lumefantrine prophylaxis for malaria among forest goers in Cambodia
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Introduction In the Greater Mekong Subregion, adults are at highest risk for malaria. The most relevant disease vectors bite during daytime and outdoors which makes forest work a high-risk activity for malaria. The absence of effective vector control strategies and limited periods of exposure during forest visits suggest that chemoprophylaxis could be an appropriate strategy to protect forest goers against malaria.
   Methods and analysis The protocol describes an open-label randomised controlled trial of artemether-lumefantrine (AL) versus multivitamin as prophylaxis against malaria among forest goers aged 16-65 years in rural northeast Cambodia. The primary objective is to compare the efficacy of the artemisinin combination therapy AL versus a multivitamin preparation as defined by the 28-day PCR parasite positivity rate and incidence of confirmed clinical malaria of any species. The sample size is 2200 patient-episodes of duration 1 month in each arm. The duration of follow-up and prophylaxis for each participant is 1,2 or 3 consecutive 28-day periods, followed by a further 28 days of post-exposure prophylaxis, depending on whether they continue to visit the forest. Analysis will be done both by intention to treat and per protocol.
   Ethics and dissemination All participants will provide written, informed consent. Ethical approval was obtained from the Oxford Tropical Research Ethics Committee and the Cambodia National Ethics Committee for Health Research. Results will be disseminated by peer-reviewed open access publication together with open data.

TI  - Potential Mammalian Vector-Borne Diseases in Live and Wet Markets in Indonesia and Myanmar
T2  - MICROBIOLOGY RESEARCH
AB  - Vector-borne diseases spread from wild animals and their associated ectoparasites to humans and domesticated animals. Wildlife markets are recognized as important areas where this transfer can take place. We assessed the potential for spreading vector-borne diseases in two live and wet markets in Myanmar (Mong La, on the Myanmar-China border) and Indonesia (Sukahaji in Bandung on the island of Java) by making an inventory of all live and freshly killed wild mammals for sale. For eight mammal families, we quantified the number of animals on offer, and we used a heatmap cluster analysis to map vector-borne diseases that these families may carry. In Myanmar, we observed large numbers of wild pigs and deer (potentially carrying West Nile and various encephalitis viruses) whereas in Indonesia we observed Old World fruit bats (potentially carrying Chikungunya and encephalitis viruses) and squirrels (potentially carrying West Nile and encephalitis viruses). The trade in Indonesia was dominated by live mammals offered for sale as pets, and only Old World fruit bats and squirrels traded for traditional Asian medicine were killed in the markets. The trade in Myanmar was more geared towards wild meat (e.g., wild pigs, deer, primates) and traditional Asian medicine (squirrels). The combined risks of vector-borne diseases spreading from traded animals to human health highlight the need for an integrated approach protecting public health, economic interests and biodiversity.

TI  - Gene dispersal via seeds and pollen and their effects on genetic structure in the facultative-apomictic Neotropical tree <i>Aspidosperma polyneuron</i>
T2  - SILVAE GENETICA
AB  - Facultative apomictic trees can produce offspring with a genotype identical to the mother due to asexual propagation through the embryo derived from cells in the maternal ovule tissues. These trees can also produce offspring with a genotype different from the mother due to genetic recombination. For many trees, these reproductive processes remain largely unexplored. Herein, we use microsatellite markers to identify apomictic and sexual reproduction in samples of adult and juvenile trees of the tropical, insect pollinated and wind seed dispersed Aspidosperma polyneuron, within a conservation area in Brazil. We also investigate seed and pollen flow and dispersal patterns and compare the genetic diversity, inbreeding, and intrapopulation spatial genetic structure (SGS) between adults and juveniles in two plots. Our results show that the species present both apomictic and sexual reproduction. Sexual reproduction occurred mainly by outcrossing, but we did detect instances of self-fertilization and mating among relatives, which explains the inbreeding observed in juveniles. Seed dispersal distance was shorter than pollen dispersal distance in one of the plots, suggesting that insect vectors are more efficient in gene dispersal than wind for seed dispersal in a high density tropical forest. The patterns of pollen and seed dispersal showed isolation by distance, explaining the SGS detected for adults and juveniles. Our results show that both seed and pollen flow increase the allelic diversity in the population. The regeneration of apomictic individuals may guarantee the continuation of genotypes adapted specifically to the study site, while sexual reproduction results in new genotypes.

TI  - Vertebrate Scavengers Control Abundance of Diarrhea-causing Bacteria in Tropical Plantations
T2  - ZOOLOGICAL STUDIES
AB  - Scavenging is a common phenomenon, particularly amongst carnivorous vertebrates. By consuming carrion, vertebrate scavengers reduce resource availability for both pathogenic bacteria and their insect vectors. We investigated the ability of wild vertebrate scavengers to control agents of human diarrheal diseases (specifically Salmonella spp. and Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli [STEC]) in oil palm plantations in Sabah (East Malaysia), and the existence of spillover effect whereby additional vertebrate scavengers from adjacent forest patches result in greater disease control in plantation sections near these forest edges. Experimental carcasses were removed by common scavengers (Varanus salvator, Canis lupus familiaris, and Viverra tangalunga) at different time points, and this determined the length of time that the carcasses persisted in the environment. The amount of pathogenic bacteria on the surfaces of filth flies collected above the experimental carcasses was positively correlated to the duration of carcass persistence, and reduction in pathogenic bacterial abundances was largely due to carcass consumption by these vertebrate scavengers. Instead of a predicted positive spillover effect (greater scavenger activity near forest edges, hence reduced pathogen abundance), we detected a weak inverse spillover effect in which STEC counts were marginally higher in plantation sections near forest patches, and human hunting along the forest-plantation boundaries could explain this. We propose that making oil palm plantations scavenger-friendly could yield great human health benefits for the millions of workers employed in this rapidly-expanding industry, without drastically changing current management practices.

TI  - Life-table analysis of <i>Anopheles arabiensis</i> in western Kenya highlands:: Effects of land covers on larval and adult survivorship
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - In high-elevation areas in western Kenya, the abundance of Anopheles arabiensis is either very low or absent. The western Kenya highlands (an area with an elevation > 1,500 m above sea level) have also been experiencing extensive deforestation, and deforestation has been suggested as one of the important factors that facilitate malaria transmission in the highlands. This study investigated whether climate conditions in the western Kenya highlands (Kakamega, elevation 1,500 m above sea level) were permissive to the development and survival of An. arabiensis and whether deforestation promoted An. arabiensis survivorship of immature and adult stages, using life-table analysis. We found that in larval habitats located in forested areas, only 4-9% of first-instar larvae developed into adults and the development length exceeded 20 days. Mean water temperature of aquatic habitats in the deforested area was 4.8-6.1 degrees C higher than that in the forested area, larval-to-adult survivorship was increased to 65-82%, and larval-to-adult development time was shortened by 8-9 days. The average indoor temperature in houses in the deforested area was 1.7-1.8 degrees C higher than in the forested area, and the relative humidity was 22-25% lower. The median survival time of adult mosquitoes in the deforested area was 49-55% higher than those in the forested area. The net reproductive rate of female mosquitoes in the deforested area was 1.7- to 2.6-fold higher than that in the forested area. Compared with previously published data on An. gambiae, the net reproductive rate of An. arabiensis was only 0.8-1.3% of Anopheles gambiae in the forested area and 2.3-2.6% in the deforested area. Therefore, the current ambient climate condition is less permissive to An. arabiensis than to An. gambiae in western Kenya highlands. However, environmental changes such as deforestation and global warming may facilitate the establishment of An. arabiensis populations in the highlands.

TI  - Efficacy of diurnal BG-Sentinel traps to capture nocturnal adult <i>Armigeres subalbatus</i> mosquitoes and impact of altitudinal variations in forests
T2  - ASIAN PACIFIC JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE
AB  - Objective: To establish an efficacious and efficient surveillance method of Armigeres (Ar.) subalbatus, a known filarial vector, surviving in forest habitats to estimate realistic population density and assess the impact of altitudinal variations on the efficacy of the trap.
   Methods: In the study, 12 locations in areas with an altitudinal range from 82 m to 920 m were selected in three reserve forests for night sampling of adult Ar. subalbatus mosquito using standard chemical lure based BG-Sentinel traps and CDC-light traps in pairs. Effects of locations and time were estimated on the efficacy of traps as mosquito density using multifactor analysis of variance for significant differences. Impact of altitudinal variations on the efficacy of traps was assessed using multiple regression with slope comparison.
   Results: BG-Sentinel trap collected significantly more adult Ar. subalbatus, 4.43 folds in Gorumara NP, 5.19 folds in Neora Valley NP and 12.10 folds in Mahananda WLS than the CDC-light trap irrespective to locations. BG-Sentinel traps were tolerant of altitudinal variations (80 m - 170 m) and showed no significant relationship between density and altitudes in contrast to CDC-light traps which showed a significant negative impact on capturing efficacy with increase in altitudes (P<0.001).
   Conclusions: The study suggests that BG-Sentinel traps can be used effectively and efficiently to collect more Ar. subalbatus mosquitoes during night time in comparison to CDC-light trap under complex climatic conditions of forest and variable altitudes.

TI  - Sand fly population dynamics and cutaneous leishmaniasis among soldiers in an Atlantic forest remnant in northeastern Brazil
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Outbreaks of cutaneous leishmaniasis are relatively common among soldiers involved in nocturnal activities in tropical forests. We investigated the population dynamics of sand flies in a military training camp located in a remnant of Atlantic rainforest in northeastern Brazil, where outbreaks of cutaneous leishmaniasis have sporadically been described. From July 2012 to July 2014, light traps were monthly placed in 10 collection sites, being nine sites located near the forest edge and one near a sheep and goat stable. Light traps operated from 5:00 pm to 6:00 am, during four consecutive nights. Leishmania infection in sand flies was assessed using a fast real-time PCR assay. Cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis among soldiers were also investigated. In total, 24,606 sand flies belonging to 25 species were identified. Males (n = 12,683) predominated over females (n = 11,923). Sand flies were present during all months, being more numerous in March (n = 1,691) and April 2013 (n = 3,324). Lutzomyia choti (72.9%) was the most abundant species, followed by Lutzomyia longispina (13.8%), Lutzomyia complexa (5.3%), representing together >90% of the sand flies collected. Forty cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis were recorded among soldiers from January 2012 to December 2014. Leishmania isolates were obtained from eight patients and were all characterized as Leishmania braziliensis. Soldiers and anyone overnighting in Atlantic rainforest remnants should adopt preventative measures such as the use of repellents on bare skin or clothes and insecticide-treated tents.

TI  - The decline of typhoid and the rise of non-typhoid salmonellae and fungal infections in a changing HIV landscape: bloodstream infection trends over 15 years in southern Vietnam
T2  - TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - The etiological spectrum of bloodstream infections is variable between industrialized and developing countries and even within a defined location over time. We investigated trends in bloodstream infections at an infectious disease hospital in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, from 1994-2008. Amongst 66111 blood cultures performed, a clinically relevant pathogen was isolated in 7645 episodes (positivity rate; 116/1000 cultures). Salmonella Typhi was the predominant pathogen until 2002; however, a considerable annual decline in the proportion of S. Typhi was observed (OR 0.6993, 95% CI [0.6885, 0.7103], p < 0.0001). Conversely, there was a significant increase in the proportions of non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS), Cryptococcus neoformans and Penicillium marneffei, concurrent with increasing HIV prevalence. These data document a substantial longitudinal shift in bloodstream infection etiology in southern Vietnam. We propose such changes are related to increasing economic prosperity and HIV prevalence, and this pattern marks a substantial change in the epidemiology of invasive salmonellosis in Southeast Asia.

TI  - Defaunation affects the populations and diets of rodents in Neotropical rainforests
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Most tropical rainforests have been defaunated of large-bodied mammals and the cascading effects of such extirpations have been poorly studied, particularly on other animals. We used a natural experiment in the Brazilian Atlantic rainforest to investigate the ecological responses of rodents to the functional extinction of a dominant terrestrial mammal, the white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecan). We detected a 45% increase in the abundance and a decrease in diversity of rodents in defaunated forests. Two of these species (Akodon montensis and Oligoryzomys nigripes) are important hosts of Hantavirus, a lethal virus for humans. Stable isotope ratios (delta C-13 and delta N-15) derived from the hair of rodents and peccaries and their food resources indicate that at least two rodent species shifted to a diet more similar to peccaries in the defaunated forest. Because most tropical rainforests are facing dramatic extirpation of large mammals, we can expect changes in the composition and structure of small mammal communities with potential consequences for human health even in non-fragmented landscapes.

TI  - Reproductive ecology of distylous <i>Palicourea padifolia</i> (Rubiaceae) in a tropical montane cloud forest.: I.: Hummingbirds' effectiveness as pollen vectors
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
AB  - The adaptiveness of distyly has been typically investigated in terms of its female function, specifically pollen receipt. However, pollen loads on stigmas can only provide moderate support for Darwin's hypothesis of the promotion of legitimate crosses. To determine the effectiveness of hummingbirds as pollen vectors between floral morphs and the consequences in terms of male (pollen transfer) and female function (pollen receipt) in Palicourea padifolia (Rubiaceae), floral visitors, their foraging modes, and temporal patterns of floral visitation were observed and documented. Differences in pollen and stigma morphology, pollen flow, rates of pollen deposition, and/or stigmatic pollen loads were then evaluated for their contribution toward differences in reproductive output between floral morphs. A pollination experiment with stuffed hummingbirds that varied in bill size was done to evaluate the contribution of bill variation toward differences between floral morphs in pollen receipt and pollen transfer and female reproductive output. Anthers of long-styled flowers contained significantly more and smaller pollen grains than those of short-styled flowers, independently of corolla and anther lengths. The shape and orientation of the stigma lobes differed between morphs and were significantly longer among short-styled flowers. Hummingbird visitation rates did not differ significantly between floral morphs, and foraging movements from focal plants towards neighboring plants were independent of floral morph. Stigmatic pollen loads under field conditions and those after controlled hummingbird visitation, along with rates of pollen accumulation through the day indicated that stigmas of short-styled flowers receive proportionately more legitimate (intermorph) pollen grains than did those of long-styled flowers. However, the species of hummingbird was marginally significant in explaining variation in pollen deposition on stigmas. Lastly, intermorph pollinations of P. padifolia resulted in significant differences in fruit production between floral morphs, independent of pollination treatment and pollinator species; short-styled flowers proportionately developed almost twice the number of fruits developed by long-styled flowers.

T2  - BIOORGANIC & MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
AB  - In an effort to identify an adequate and sustainable natural source of the recently described anti-HIV drug development candidate calanolide A, we undertook chemical and biological studies of the latex exuded from trees of the genus Calophyllum. Although we found that calanolide A was not present in latex from the original source species, C. lanigerum var. austrocoriaceum, we did observe that a related coumarin, costatolide, was abundant in latex of C. teysmannii var. inophylloide. Costatolide is currently being evaluated as a possible alternative to calanolide A for drug development.

TI  - Small mammal diversity and dynamics within Nigeria, with emphasis on reservoirs of the lassa virus
T2  - SYSTEMATICS AND BIODIVERSITY
AB  - Nigeria has a rich small mammal community, with several species implicated as carriers of zoonotic microbes such as the Lassa virus (LASV). We sought to elucidate the diversity and distribution of these animals (including known LASV reservoirs) geographically, habitat-wise and seasonally. Our DNA-assisted survey detected at least 19 small mammal species amongst 790 specimens. Diversity indices were similar between ecological zones and also between endemic and non-endemic areas for Lassa fever. Mastomys natalensis, the most renowned LASV host, was present in eight out of nine localities sampled. We also described the spatial occurrence of other known LASV hosts such as M. erythroleucus and Hylomyscus pamfi, including carriers of LASV-like arenaviruses such as Mus (Nannomys) spp. The most numerous rodents (Mastomys natalensis, M. erythroleucus, and Praomys daltoni) were captured mainly inside human dwellings. Reproductive activity occurred throughout the year, but led to population peaks for M. natalensis in the dry season and for M. erythroleucus and P. daltoni in the rainy season. Extensive geographic distribution of LASV rodent reservoirs, with population peaks in different seasons, shows that the risk of rodent-to-human transmission of LASV is greater than currently realized.

TI  - High-resolution GPS tracking of Lyle's flying fox between temples and orchards in central Thailand
T2  - JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT
AB  - Hunting and loss of natural habitats increasingly threaten tropical biodiversity and ecosystems, particularly in Southeast Asia. Flying foxes often persist in anthropogenic areas where other wildlife has vanished, and where they play a significant ecological role in vegetation regeneration in disturbed habitats. Detailed knowledge on the foraging behavior of flying foxes is crucial for understanding how they survive in degraded habitats and for the management of human-wildlife conflicts. Thailand still harbors large colonies (several thousand individuals) of Lyle's flying fox (Pteropus lylei), a species ranked as Vulnerable on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List, at temples situated in agricultural landscapes. We used high-resolution global positioning system (GPS) loggers to study the movement and foraging behavior of this species at 2 temples in central Thailand during 2 seasons. We analyzed GPS and acceleration data of 19 tagged individuals, and assessed habitat use and diet. Foraging individuals commuted between day roosts and foraging areas each night, followed by small-scale movements in foraging areas, and showed high site fidelity during the study period. Maximum linear distances between day roosts and foraging areas varied greatly between individuals (2.2-23.6km) but were similar between seasons. Tracked bats mostly foraged in farmland, plantations, and gardens, yet our data indicate that small mangrove remnants constitute important habitat components for Lyle's flying fox. We recorded a highly diverse diet of 34 food plant species, comprised of exotic crops and native plants as available. Our results suggest that conservation and landscape managers should preserve remaining native trees and natural vegetation in the study area as resources for Lyle's flying fox, at the same time reducing potential for conflicts between bats and humans on crops. They can further be used for public information campaigns integrating the potential of Lyle's flying fox as dispersers of useful plants and the human health risks through zoonotic diseases associated with hunting and consumption of this species.

TI  - Prey choice of introduced species by the common vampire bat (<i>Desmodus rotundus</i>) on an Atlantic Forest land-bridge island
T2  - ACTA CHIROPTEROLOGICA
AB  - The proliferation of native, alien, invasive and domestic species offers enough novel and abundant food resources for the common vampire bat, Desmodus rotundus, to potentially alter preferences for prey. By reference to a stable-isotope analysis for carbon and nitrogen, we report here on the choices of introduced mammal prey made by D. rotundus residing on Anchieta Island a tropical land-bridge island from which domestic animals were removed and 100 individuals of 15 mammal species were introduced intentionally. Our analysis shows that the studied individuals of D. rotundus were more likely to prey upon species of open habitats (mean value of delta C-13 = -14.8 parts per thousand), that is, animals with high delta C-13 values characterising the consumption of C-4 resources. The delta N-15 values for D. rotundus were higher than expected, most likely similar to apex predator species (mean value of 8,2 parts per thousand) and overlapped the isotopic niche with capybaras (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) on the island. Values were in turn distant from those noted for coatis, as well as other potential prey from a preserved area on the mainland (capybaras included), indicating that, from among all the potential mammalian prey species, the studied bats were feeding exclusively on capybaras, which also represent the species with the greatest mammalian biomass on the island. Previous information regarding the time of human occupation suggests that the domestic animals then present on Anchieta Island might have been the main prey of D. rotundus and responsible for maintaining a viable population. As capybaras were introduced only 36 years ago, this suggests a rapid shift in predation preference induced by anthropogenic disturbances that have allowed D. rotundus to exploit these rodents successfully. Records in the literature further show that common vampire bats were not captured in preserved areas of the mainland close to Anchieta Island, indicating that the rate of capture characterising D. rotundus is usually low in natural forested habitats where potential prey are scattered. As three individuals of the introduced population of capybaras were confirmed to have died from bat rabies virus (RABV) in 2020, we advocate periodic monitoring for bat rabies viruses in the D. rotundus population on Anchieta Island (as well as nearby areas), so that the magnitude of the outbreak may be determined mid control strategies developed. Such actions are all the more important given that both the island and nearby areas are frequented by tourists. We highlight that the prey choice indicated here is context-dependent, and possibly influenced by the removal of domestic animals, as well as the explosive population growth achieved by the introduced capybaras, in combination with the predictability of their foraging behaviour.

TI  - Landscape Genetics Reveals Focal Transmission of a Human Macroparasite
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Macroparasite infections (e.g., helminths) remain a major human health concern. However, assessing transmission dynamics is problematic because the direct observation of macroparasite dispersal among hosts is not possible. We used a novel landscape genetics approach to examine transmission of the human roundworm Ascaris lumbricoides in a small human population in Jiri, Nepal. Unexpectedly, we found significant genetic structuring of parasites, indicating the presence of multiple transmission foci within a small sampling area (similar to 14 km(2)). We analyzed several epidemiological variables, and found that transmission is spatially autocorrelated around households and that transmission foci are stable over time despite extensive human movement. These results would not have been obtainable via a traditional epidemiological study based on worm counts alone. Our data refute the assumption that a single host population corresponds to a single parasite transmission unit, an assumption implicit in many classic models of macroparasite transmission. Newer models have shown that the metapopulation-like pattern observed in our data can adversely affect targeted control strategies aimed at community-wide impacts. Furthermore, the observed metapopulation structure and local mating patterns generate an excess of homozygotes that can accelerate the spread of recessive traits such as drug resistance. Our study illustrates how molecular analyses complement traditional epidemiological information in providing a better understanding of parasite transmission. Similar landscape genetic approaches in other macroparasite systems will be warranted if an accurate depiction of the transmission process is to be used to inform effective control strategies.

AB  - We studied the reproductive attributes (reproductive phenology, pollination and seed dispersion) of understory woody species from a rainforest area in the Araripe-Apodi National Forest (FLONA), NE Brazil. The FLONA has a representative number of fauna and flora species that are important for the local climatic, hydrological and ecological equilibrium of the region. The community was composed of 68 species distributed in 43 genera and 26 plant families. Melastomataceae was the family with the highest species richness. Most species (61.76%) shared floral traits that promoted bee pollination, for example white, dish type, medium-sized flowers with pollen as the main resource. Zoochory was the most frequent dispersion system (76.47%), followed by autochory (16.17%) and anemochory (7.35%). Resource distribution (flowers and fruits) was uniform throughout the year, and pollination and dispersion networks were significantly modular, composed of five and four modules, respectively. In the pollination network, bees occurred in almost all modules, but flies, hummingbirds, butterflies and hawk moths were more restricted to certain modules, partially highlighting the idea of pollination syndromes. In the dispersion network, the modules were composed of birds from different families; only one module was comprised of all sampled mammals. Our results show that most species depend on the action of biotic vectors during their reproductive processes (pollination and dispersal). Those interactions are fundamental for maintaining biological diversity in different tropical ecosystems.

TI  - Testing the efficacy of hyperspectral (AVIRIS-NG), multispectral (Sentinel-2) and radar (Sentinel-1) remote sensing images to detect native and invasive non-native trees
T2  - BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS
AB  - Invasive alien species threaten tropical grasslands and native biodiversity across the globe, including in the natural mosaic of native grasslands and forests in the Shola Sky Islands of the Western Ghats. Here, grasslands have been lost to exotic tree invasion (Acacias, Eucalyptus, and Pines) since the 1950s, but differing invasion intensities between these species and intermixing with native species constitutes a major challenge for remotely sensed assessments. In this study, we assess the accuracy of three satellite and airborne remote sensing sensors (Sentinel-1 radar data, Sentinel-2 multispectral data and AVIRIS-NG hyperspectral data) and three machine learning classification algorithms to identify the spatial extent of native habitats and invasive tree species. We used the support vector machine (SVM), classification and regression trees (CART), and random forest (RF) algorithms implemented on the Google Earth Engine platform. Results indicate that AVIRIS-NG data in combination with SVM produced the highest classification accuracy (98.7%). Fused Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 produce 91% accuracy, while Sentinel-2 alone yielded 91% accuracy; but only with higher coverage of ground control points. The hyperspectral data (AVIRIS-NG) was the only sensor that permitted distinguishing recent invasions (young trees) with high precision. We suspect that large areas will have to be mapped and assessed in the coming years by conservation managers, NGOs to plan restoration or to assess the success of restoration activities, for which a choice of sensors may have to be made based on the age of invasion being mapped, and the quantum of ground control data available.

TI  - Level of damage on <i>sengon</i> stand based on tree vitality indicators at <i>sengon</i> community forest in Serang District, Banten Province
T2  - INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON FOREST CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT (ICFCM) 2019: INNOVATIVE SOLUTION FOR MANAGING TROPICAL FORESTS AND CONSERVING BIODIVERSITY TO SUPPORT SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS
CP  - International Conference on Forest Conservation and Management (ICFCM)
AB  - Sengon plantation is the primary commodity of the community forests, which produces timber with high economic value, especially in Java Island. However, now the condition of sengon stands in Java Island, pests and diseases have attacked most. The information about the health and the severity of the stands due to pests and diseases is beneficial for determining stand productivity and investment security. The purpose of this activity is to determine the level of damage on sengon stands at various locations in Serang Regency, Banten, based on indicators of tree vitality. The method used to determine stand health is Forest Health Monitoring (FHM), which includes using tree vitality indicators and site quality indicators as a basis for assessment. The observation plot was carried out at 3 locations determined purposively based on the flat distance from the beach, which is < 2 km; 2> X< 4 km; 4> X <= 6 km. The results showed that the average percentage of healthy sengon trees was still quite high (82.7%), but the level of damage to stands was moderate. The most common type of damage is gummosis (distance <= 2 km and > 4-6 km) and boktor (> 2- 4 km). Many tree damage occurs in the main branch location found in the live canopy section (code 6), especially in plots that are 2> X <= 4 km from the coastline and lower stem (distance <= 2 km). However, no damage was found at the root location (code 1), shoots (code 8) and leaves (code 9). The damage of the stem causes a decrease in wood production because the damaged at part of the stem cannot be used anymore. Visual Crown Ratio of sengon trees tends to be low due to young trees so that the canopy is not maximal Maintenance activities, as well as mixed planting techniques with intercropping plants and other woody plants, can prevent sengon plants from attacking pests and diseases.

TI  - <i>Bd</i> on the Beach: High Prevalence of <i>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</i> in the Lowland Forests of Gorgona Island (Colombia, South America)
T2  - ECOHEALTH
AB  - The amphibian chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, Bd, has been implicated in the decimation and extinction of many amphibian populations worldwide, especially at mid and high elevations. Recent studies have demonstrated the presence of the pathogen in the lowlands from Australia and Central America. We extend here its elevational range by demonstrating its presence at the sea level, in the lowland forests of Gorgona Island, off the Pacific coast of Colombia. We conducted two field surveys, separated by four years, and diagnosed Bd by performing polymerase chain reactions on swab samples from the skin of five amphibian species. All species, including the Critically Endangered Atelopus elegans, tested positive for the pathogen, with prevalences between 3.9 % in A. elegans (in 2010) and 52 % in Pristimantis achatinus. Clinical signs of chytridiomycosis were not detected in any species. To our knowledge, this is the first report of B. dendrobatidis in tropical lowlands at sea level, where temperatures may exceed optimal growth temperatures of this pathogen. This finding highlights the need to understand the mechanisms allowing the interaction between frogs and pathogen in lowland ecosystems.

TI  - Analysis of a negative plant-soil feedback in a subtropical monsoon forest
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
AB  - 1. The JanzenConnell hypothesis provides explanations for species coexistence and predicts that recruitment of tree juveniles is reduced by host-specific enemies, particularly soil biota. Previous studies, however, have not fully addressed the aspect of host specificity. Using a legume tree (Ormosia glaberrima) in a subtropical monsoon forest as a model, we experimentally investigated the mechanisms underlying a JanzenConnell effect. 2. A negative plantsoil feedback was identified by a field census and confirmed by planting surface-sterilized seeds at different densities around focal trees. Fungicides were applied to test whether the effects were caused by fungi. In a growth-room inoculation experiment, effects of collected soil samples on seedling survival were examined and compared to soil samples treated with fungicides. Sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) sequence of the 28S ribosomal RNA gene was used for pathogen identification. The fungus causing seedling mortality was isolated and characterized by ITS rDNA sequencing and inoculation experiments. 3. A JanzenConnell effect was identified at a field site, in which O. glaberrima was a locally common species. In situ treatments with fungicides and a corresponding growth-room simulation experiment showed that seedling survival depended on the distance to focal adult trees and that a fungal pathogen attacked seeds and seedlings. No negative plantsoil feedback was observed at another field site with a single O. glaberrima tree, indicating a locally rare species advantage. 4. The disease-inducing fungus was identified as Fusarium oxysporum. Inoculation experiments showed that the isolated fungus was pathogenic on O. glaberrima seedlings, but non-pathogenic on seedlings from other tree species co-occurring with O. glaberrima. Moreover, susceptibility of O. glaberrima depended on seed provenance (likely genotype). 5. Synthesis. We demonstrate that an observed negative plantsoil feedback on a locally common legume tree is caused by a host-specific pathogen. Our data fully support the criteria of spatially unequal pathogen distribution and host specificity proposed in the JanzenConnell model. Taken the interaction between O. glaberrima and F. oxysporum as a paradigm, we suggest that host-specific pathogens, locally accumulated around parent trees, are important determinants of tree community structure.

TI  - Elevated <i>Plasmodium</i> infection rates and high pyrethroid resistance in major malaria vectors in a forested area of Cameroon highlight challenges of malaria control
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
AB  - Background: High coverage of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) is the cornerstone of the malaria control strategy of the national malaria control program (NMCP) in Cameroon, with a target of reducing malaria transmission to less than 10% by 2035. To this end, more than 20 million LLINs have been distributed to populations countrywide since 2011. The present study evaluated entomological indices and Anopheles susceptibility to pyrethroids in a rural forested area of south Cameroon with high coverage of LLINs.
   Methods: The study was conducted between July 2014 and May 2016 in Obout, a village located in a rural forested area in south Cameroon. Resting mosquitoes were collected using electric aspirators and were identified to species using morphological criteria and PCR tools. Mosquito feeding preferences and infection status to Plasmodium falciparum were determined by ELISA and using TaqMan assays. The susceptibility of wild F1 adults to pyrethroids was monitored using WHO insecticide susceptibility bioassays.
   Results: During the study period, 5,993 Anopheles mosquitoes were collected indoors both in rooms with and without nets. Two main vector species, namely An. funestus and An. gambiae, were identified in the locality, with An. funestus being by far the most abundant (89.68%). ELISA analysis revealed high percentage of blood meal taken exclusively on human (97.65-98.95%) supporting the high antropohilic behaviour of both species. Plasmodium falciparum infection rate detected by ELISA was high throughout the study period and varied between 3.28-14.04% (mean: 10.40%) in An. funestus, and between 5.55-22.22% (mean: 13.87%) in An. gambiae. This trend was confirmed by TaqMan assays, with P. falciparum infection prevalence of 23.33% in An. funestus. Significant decrease of mortality associated with high frequency of kdr mutation was observed in An. gambiae (deltamethrin: 36.6-56.45%; permethrin: 6-18.65%) indicating high level of resistance to pyrethroids. For An. funestus, resistance was marked for deltamethrin (mortality: 70.54-76.24%) than for permethrin (94.12-94.74%).
   Conclusions: Our study showed that despite LLINs, the population of Obout remains exposed to bites of highly infected An. funestus and An. gambiae mosquitoes, highlighting the challenges to controlling malaria in forested areas, especially in the presence of insecticide resistance.

TI  - <i>Neopestalotiopsis alpapicalis sp</i>. <i>nov</i>. a new endophyte from tropical mangrove trees in Krabi Province (Thailand)
T2  - PHYTOTAXA
AB  - Mangrove forests are dynamic systems primarily confined to tropical and subtropical coastal regions. Mangroves are highly complex habitats sustaining a diverse array of terrestrial and aquatic fungal species. Endophytic fungi are widely distributed in mangrove ecosystems and are integral contributors to global biodiversity. Neopestalotiopsis species occur as endophytes, saprobes and opportunistic pathogens of many plant hosts. Herein, a new species of Neopestalotiopsis, N. alpapicalis, was collected from the mangrove trees Rhizophora apiculata and Rhizophora mucronata, in Krabi, Thailand Morphological features conform to those of Neopestalotiopsis. Number of apical appendages and size of apical cells of the newly described species differ from those of phylogenetically related species. A combined dataset of ITS, beta-tub and TEF1 genes was used to infer the phylogenetic placement of the new species. The two strains of novel species, N. alpapicalis clustered together and have a close affinity to N. rosicola.

TI  - The drug and vaccine landscape for neglected diseases (2000-11): a systematic assessment
T2  - LANCET GLOBAL HEALTH
AB  - Background In 1975-99, only 1.1% of new therapeutic products had been developed for neglected diseases. Since then, several public and private initiatives have attempted to mitigate this imbalance. We analysed the research and development pipeline of drugs and vaccines for neglected diseases from 2000 to 2011.
   Methods We searched databases of drug regulatory authorities, WHO, and clinical trial registries for entries made between Jan 1, 2000, and Dec 31, 2011. We defined neglected diseases as malaria, tuberculosis, diarrhoeal diseases, neglected tropical diseases (NTDs; WHO definition), and other diseases of poverty according to common definitions.
   Findings Of the 850 new therapeutic products registered in 2000-11, 37 (4%) were indicated for neglected diseases, comprising 25 products with a new indication or formulation and eight vaccines or biological products. Only four new chemical entities were approved for neglected diseases (three for malaria, one for diarrhoeal disease), accounting for 1% of the 336 new chemical entities approved during the study period. Of 148 445 clinical trials registered in Dec 31, 2011, only 2016 (1%) were for neglected diseases.
   Interpretation Our findings show a persistent insufficiency in drug and vaccine development for neglected diseases. Nevertheless, these and other data show a slight improvement during the past 12 years in new therapeutics development and registration. However, for many neglected diseases, new therapeutic products urgently need to be developed and delivered to improve control and potentially achieve elimination.

TI  - Population ecology of epiphytic angiosperms: A review
T2  - TROPICAL ECOLOGY
AB  - Epiphytic angiosperms represent ca. 10 % of the world's flowering plants and are key elements in tropical forests. Here we synthesize the available literature on their population ecology in an attempt to find patterns that may characterize them. Epiphytes tend to have specialized pollination systems frequently involving animal vectors, resulting in a mixture of selfing and outcrossing that ensures abundant seed production. Seed dispersal is anemochorous in 84 % of the species and is pivotal for the establishment of new local populations within metapopulation. Seed germination is highly dependent on specific environmental conditions, resulting in seedling establishment in particular microhabitats on phorophytes. Individual growth rates are slow and limited by the low water and nutrient availability characteristic of the epiphytic habitat. Population growth rates (X) are close to unity and depend mostly on the survival of adults. This plant group is highly vulnerable to habitat loss and climate change.

AB  - Zika virus is an emergent pathogen that gained significant importance during the epidemic in South and Central America as unusual and alarming complications of infection were recognized. Although initially considered a self-limited benign infection, a panoply of neurologic complications were recognized including a Guillain-Barre-like syndrome and in-utero fetal infection causing microcephaly, blindness, and other congenital neurologic complications. Numerous Zika virus vaccines were developed, with nine different vaccines representing five di fferent platforms entered into clinical trials, one progressing to Phase II. Here we review the current landscape and challenges confronting Zika virus vaccine development.

TI  - <i>Trypanosoma cruzi</i> in Mexican Neotropical vectors and mammals: wildlife, livestock, pets, and human population
T2  - SALUD PUBLICA DE MEXICO
AB  - Objective. To provide primary evidence of Trypanosoma cruzi landscape genetics in the Mexican Neotropics. Materials and methods. Trypanosoma cruzi and discrete typing units (DTU) prevalence were analyzed in landscape communities of vectors, wildlife, livestock, pets, and sympatric human populations using endpoint PCR and sequencing of all relevant amplicons from mitochondrial (kDNA) and nuclear (ME, 18S, 24Sa) gene markers. Results. Although 98% of the infected sample-set (N=2 963) contained single or mixed infections of DTUI (TcI, 96.2%) and TcVI (22.6%), TcIV and TcII were also identified. Sensitivity of individual markers varied and was dependent on host taxon; kDNA, ME and 18S combined identified 95% of infections. ME genotyped 90% of vector infections, but 60% of mammals (36% wildlife), while neither 18S nor 24Sa typed more than 20% of mammal infections. Conclusion. Available gene fragments to identify or genotype T. cruzi are not universally sensitive for all landscape parasite populations, highlighting important T. cruzi heterogeneity among mammal reservoir taxa and triatomine species.

TI  - Computational prediction of B and T-cell epitopes of Kyasanur Forest Disease virus marker proteins towards the development of precise diagnosis and potent subunit vaccine
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOMOLECULAR STRUCTURE & DYNAMICS
AB  - Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD), also known as 'monkey fever', caused by KFD Virus (KFDV), is a highly neglected tropical disease endemic to Western Ghat region of Karnataka, India. Recently, KFD, which is fatal for both monkeys and humans with a mortality rate of 2-10% has been found to spread from its epicenter to neighboring districts and states also. The current ELISA based KFD detection method is very non-specific due to cross-reactivity with other flaviviruses. Further, presently available formalin-inactivated vaccine has been found to be less effective leading to disease susceptibility and severity. To address these, the present study was aimed at predicting the potent specific B and T-cell epitopes of KFDV immunogenic marker proteins using diverse computational tools aiming at developing precise diagnostic method and an effective subunit vaccine. Here, we have chosen E, NS1 and NS5 proteins as markers of KFDV by taking into account of their differential and non-overlapping sequences with selected arboviruses. Based on the linear and nonlinear epitope prediction tools and important biophysical parameters, we identified three potential linear and ten nonlinear B-cell epitopes. We also predicted T-cell epitope peptides which binds to MHC class-I and class-II receptors for the effective T-cell activation. Thus, our molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation analysis has identified six different T-H-cell epitopes based on the distribution frequency of MHC-II haplotypes in the human population and one T-C-cell epitope from NS5 protein that has maximum interaction with class-I MHC. Overall, we have successfully identified potential B and T-cell epitope marker peptides present in the envelope and two non-structural proteins. Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma

TI  - Epidemiology of Emergent Madariaga Encephalitis in a Region with Endemic Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis: Initial Host Studies and Human Cross-Sectional Study in Darien, Panama
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   Neurotropic arboviral infections are an important cause of encephalitis. A zoonotic, vector-borne alphavirus, Madariaga virus (MADV; formerly known as South American eastern equine encephalitis virus), caused its first documented human outbreak in 2010 in Darien, Panama, where the genetically similar Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) is endemic. We report the results of a seroprevalence survey of animals and humans, illustrating contrasting features of MADV and VEEV ecology and epidemiology.
   Methods
   Small mammals were trapped in 42 sites in Darien, Panama, using Sherman traps, Tomahawk traps, and mist nets for bats. Blood was tested for the presence of neutralizing antibodies to MADV and VEEV. In addition, bird sera collected in 2007 in Chagres, Panama, were tested for MADV and VEEV neutralizing antibodies. Viremia was ascertained by RTPCR. Human exposure to these two viruses was determined by IgG ELISA, followed by plaque reduction neutralization tests. To identify relevant risk factors for MADV or VEEV exposure, logistic regression analysis was performed, and the most parsimonious model was selected based on the Akaike information criterion.
   Results
   The animal survey yielded 32 bats (16 species), 556 rodents (12 species), and 20 opossums (4 species). The short-tailed cane mouse (Zygodontomys brevicauda) found abundantly in pasture and farms, had the highest MADV seroprevalence (8.3%). For VEEV, the shrub and forest-dwelling long-whiskered rice rat (Transandinomys bolivaris) had the highest seroprevalence (19.0%). Viremia was detected in one animal (Z. brevicauda). Of the 159 bird sera (50 species) tested, none were positive for either virus. In humans (n = 770), neutralizing antibodies to MADV and VEEV were present in 4.8% and 31.5%, respectively. MADV seropositivity was positively associated with cattle ranching, farming, and fishing. Having VEEV antibodies and shrubs near the house diminished risk. Age, forest work, farming and fishing were risk factors for VEEV, while having MADV antibodies, glazed windows, waste pick-up and piped water were protective.
   Conclusion
   Our findings suggest that the short-tailed cane mouse and the long-whiskered rice rat serve as hosts for MADV and VEEV, respectively. The preferred habitat of these rodent species coincides with areas associated with human infection risk. Our findings also indicate that MADV emerged recently in humans, and that the transmission cycles of these two sympatric alphaviruses differ spatially and in host utilization.

TI  - Water Quality Index Using Modified Random Forest Technique: Assessing Novel Input Features
T2  - CMES-COMPUTER MODELING IN ENGINEERING & SCIENCES
AB  - Water quality analysis is essential to understand the ecological status of aquatic life. Conventional water quality index (WQI) assessment methods are limited to features such as water acidic or basicity (pH), dissolved oxygen (DO), biological oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammoniacal nitrogen (NH3-N), and suspended solids (SS). These features are often insufficient to represent the water quality of a heavy metal-polluted river. Therefore, this paper aims to explore and analyze novel input features in order to formulate an improved WQI. In this work, prospective insights on the feasibility of alternative water quality input variables as new discriminant features are discussed. The new discriminant features are a step toward formulating adaptive water quality parameters according to the land use activities surrounding the river. The results and analysis obtained from this study have proven the possibility of predicting WQI using new input features. This work analyzes 17 new input features, namely conductivity (COND), salinity (SAL), turbidity (TUR), dissolved solids (DS), nitrate (NO3), chloride (Cl), phosphate (PO4), arsenic (As), chromium (Cr), zinc (Zn), calcium (Ca), iron (Fe), potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), sodium (Na), E. coli, and total coliform, in predicting WQI using machine learning techniques. Five regression algorithms-randomforest (RF), AdaBoost, support vector regression (SVR), decision tree regression (DTR), and multilayer perception (MLP)-are applied for preliminary model selection. The results show that the RF algorithm exhibits better prediction performance, with R-2 of 0.974. Then, this work proposes a modified RF by incorporating the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) into the conventional RF method. The proposed modified RF method is shown to achieve 77.68%, 74%, 69%, and 71% accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, respectively. In addition, the sensitivity analysis is included to highlight the importance of the turbidity variable in WQI prediction. The results of sensitivity analysis highlight the importance of certain water quality variables that are not present in the conventionalWQI formulation.

TI  - Leaf damage dynamics of <i>Drimys granadensis</i> (Winteraceae) and <i>Clusia multiflora</i> (Clusiaceae) seedlings in the High-Andean Forest.
T2  - REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL
AB  - Leaf damage dynamics of Drimys granadensis (Winteraceae) and Clusia multiflora (Clusiaceae) seedlings in the High-Andean Forest. Because of their slow growth, shade-tolerant species remain exposed to foliar damage long before reproductive age. Foliar damage can be controlled through synchronous leaf production and specialized phytochemical strategies. In this study, the dynamics of foliar damage in different cohorts of seedlings were evaluated to determine if the High-Andean species, Clusia multiflora (Clusiaceae) and Drimys granadensis (Winteraceae) appeal to the synchronous leaf production for controlling the herbivory and pathogenical damage, and to establish the possible relations between the healthy state, growth and mortality of seedlings. Since a recently-emerged seedling could not supply the physiological costs of specialized strategies, we expected the highest synchronous leaf production in the youngest individuals, and differences between cohorts in foliar damage. Four variables were measured to evaluate the health state along time, in three cohorts of seedlings: Proportion of predated leaves (P-p), proportion of healthy leaves (P-s), proportion of leaves with symptoms of disease or punctual damage (P-e) and growing (% increment of height). Both species showed significant differences between periods in the proportion of healthy leaves, but there was not an effect of time-cohort interaction, therefore synchronic production of leaves was not a strategy more used for any particular cohort. Foliar damage oscillated along time, fact that can be explained by the pulses of leaf production. However, this strategy had little efficiency to control the pathogen attack. In general, the unified behavior of all variables was affected by cohort, time, species an all the different interactions. Association between growing and foliar damage were conditioned by climate. The highest mortality ocurred during the dry season, and one fourth of the D. granadensis deaths were caused by the joint action of herbivory and drought. Results suggest that in spite of the synchronous leaf production in all cohorts, this strategy quickly loses the efficiency for controlling foliar damage, because the means of P-s were below of 0.25 at the end of the monitoring period. The differences between species in the dynamics of health state should explain partially their coexistence in the High-Andean forest. Rev. Biol. Trop. 56 (3): 1087-1100. Epub 2008 September 30.

TI  - Reunion overseas: introduced wild boars and cultivated orange trees interact in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest
T2  - REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL
AB  - Introduction: Little is known concerning novel interactions between species that typically interact in their native range but, as a consequence of human activity, are also interacting out of their original distribution under new ecological conditions. Objective: We investigate the interaction between the orange tree and wild boar, both of which share Asian origins and have been introduced to the Americas (i.e. the overseas). Methods: Specifically, we assessed whether i) wild boars consume orange (Citrus sinensis) fruits and seeds in orchards adjacent to a remnant of the Atlantic Forest of Brazil, ii) the orange seeds are viable after passing through boar's digestive tract and iii) whether the orange tree may naturalise in the forest remnant assisted by wild boars. Results: Our camera surveys indicated that wild boar was by far the most frequent consumer of orange fruits (40.5 % of camera trap-days). A considerable proportion of sown orange seeds extracted from fresh boar feces emerged seedlings (27.8 %, N = 386) under controlled greenhouse conditions. Further, 37.6 % of sown seeds (N = 500) in the forest remnant emerged seedlings in July 2015; however, after similar to 4 years (March 2019) only 9 seedlings survived (i.e. 4.8 %, N = 188). Finally, 52 sweet orange seedlings were found during surveys within the forest remnant which is intensively used by wild boars. This study indicates a high potential of boars to act as effective seed dispersers of the sweet orange. However, harsh competition with native vegetation and the incidence of lethal diseases, which quickly kill sweet orange trees under non-agricultural conditions, could seriously limit orange tree establishment in the forest. Conclusions: Our results have important implications not only because the wild boar could be a vector of potential invasive species, but also because they disperse seeds of some native species (e.g. the queen palm, Syagrus romanzofiana) in defaunated forests, where large native seed dispersers are missing; thus, wild boars could exert critical ecological functions lost due to human activity.

TI  - Nudge strategies for behavior-based prevention and control of neglected tropical diseases: A scoping review and ethical assessment
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   Nudging, a strategy that uses subtle stimuli to direct people's behavior, has recently been included as an effective and low-cost behavior change strategy in low- and middle- income countries (LMIC), targeting behavior-based prevention and control of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). The present scoping review aims to provide a timely overview of how nudge interventions have been applied within this field. In addition, the review proposes a framework for the ethical consideration of nudges for NTD prevention and control, or more broadly global health promotion.
   Methods
   A comprehensive search was performed in several databases: MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Embase (Ovid), Web of Science Core Collection, CINAHL, ERIC and Econ.Lit (EBSCO), as well as registered trials and reviews in CENTRAL and PROSPERO to identify ongoing or unpublished studies. Additionally, studies were included through a handpicked search on websites of governmental nudge units and global health or development organizations.
   Results
   This scoping review identified 33 relevant studies, with only two studies targeting NTDs in particular, resulting in a total of 67 nudge strategies. Most nudges targeted handwashing behavior and were focused on general health practices rather than targeting a specific disease in particular. The most common nudge strategies were those targeting decision assistance, such as facilitating commitment and reminder actions. The majority of nudges were of moderate to high ethical standards, with the highest standards being those that had the most immediate and significant health benefits, and those implemented by agents in a trust relationship with the target audience.
   Conclusion
   Three key recommendations should inform research investigating nudge strategies in global health promotion in general. Firstly, future efforts should investigate the different opportunities that nudges present for targeting NTDs in particular, rather than relying solely on integrated health promotion approaches. Secondly, to apply robust study designs including rigorous process and impact evaluation which allow for a better understanding of 'what works' and 'how it works'. Finally, to consider the ethical implications of implementing nudge strategies, specifically in LMIC.
   Author summary
   Behavior is at the core of neglected tropical disease (NTD) prevention and control, certainly within low-, and middle- income countries (LMIC) where resources are often limited. Therefore, strategies to promote behavior change should be included and investigated in future efforts. Nudging, a low-cost strategy that subtly directs people towards positive behavioral choices, has recently gained attention in global health promotion. Nudge strategies have been applied to a wide range of health-promoting behaviors such as handwashing. To understand which strategies were used, where and how these were applied, and whether these were ethically informed and implemented, we undertook a comprehensive review of the available sources. This resulted in 33 included studies, with a total of 67 nudge strategies for behavior-based prevention and control of NTDs in LMIC. Only two studies targeted NTDs in particular, the other 31 included studies were focused on more general health promoting behaviors, with the majority targeting handwashing with soap. The most common nudge strategies were those targeting decision assistance, such as fostering commitment and reminder actions. In general, the ethical assessment presented favorable results. We identified the need for robust study designs to better understand how nudges can be implemented in the future.

TI  - Integrating Parasitological and Entomological Observations to Understand Malaria Transmission in Riverine Villages in the Peruvian Amazon
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB  - Background. Remote rural riverine villages account for most of the reported malaria cases in the Peruvian Amazon. As transmission decreases due to intensive standard control efforts, malaria strategies in these villages will need to be more focused and adapted to local epidemiology.
   Methods. By integrating parasitological, entomological, and environmental observations between January 2016 and June 2017, we provided an in-depth characterization of malaria transmission dynamics in 4 riverine villages of the Mazan district, Loreto department.
   Results. Despite variation across villages, malaria prevalence by polymerase chain reaction in March 2016 was high (>25% in 3 villages), caused by Plasmodium vivax mainly and composed of mostly submicroscopic infections. Housing without complete walls was the main malaria risk factor, while households close to forest edges were more commonly identified as spatial clusters of malaria prevalence. Villages in the basin of the Mazan River had a higher density of adult Anopheles darlingi mosquitoes, and retained higher prevalence and incidence rates compared to villages in the basin of the Napo River despite test-and-treat interventions.
   Conclusions. High heterogeneity in malaria transmission was found across and within riverine villages, resulting from interactions between the microgeographic landscape driving diverse conditions for vector development, housing structure, and human behavior.

TI  - Landscape genomics and selection signatures of local adaptation of Eritrean indigenous cattle along environmental gradients
T2  - TROPICAL ANIMAL HEALTH AND PRODUCTION
AB  - Most parts of Eritrea are classified as arid and semi-arid land (ASALs) which are characterised by dryness, high ambient temperatures and low precipitation. The country has three different environmental landscapes: highland, Western lowland and Eastern lowland agro-ecological zones (AEZs). The geophysical and biophysical characteristics of the AEZs vary. Indigenous cattle which are mainly kept in extensive production system have to cope with the adverse climatic conditions of these AEZs. They have to adapt to the harsh climate, poor feed quality and endemic diseases and parasites and reproduction challenges in the AEZs. The underlying genetic basis of the indigenous cattle adaption to the specific AEZs in Eritrea is limited. In this study, it is hypothesized that the indigenous cattle have evolved and developed unique adaptive characteristics because of being reared in specific ecological landscapes. This was tested using the landscape genomics and analysis of selection signatures to ascertain the genetic basis of their adaptability to the nutritional and environmental constraints that characterise the AEZ conditions. The study was carried out in three different environmental landscapes: highland, Eastern lowland and Western lowland AEZs. Blood samples were collected from a total of 188 indigenous cattle populations sampled from the three AEZs. DNA was extracted and genotyped using the genotype by sequencing (GBS) method. Analysis revealed the existence of medium to high genetic diversity between and within the indigenous cattle populations. Scanning of selection signatures revealed genomic regions under positive selection. The regions harboured genes (IFNAR2, CASR, AHSG, ATP1B3, AIRE, ROBO2, SCHIP1 and PARS2) of importance for facial morphology, locomotion, mineral homeostasis, immune system and skeletal and muscle system development. Findings pointed out the influence of AEZ landscapes on the genetic differentiation of indigenous cattle appearances probably due to selection driven by diverse climatic and biophysical conditions. The differentiation is orientated towards adaptive characteristics.

TI  - Wild terrestrial rainforest mammals as potential reservoirs for flaviviruses (yellow fever, dengue 2 and St Louis encephalitis viruses) in French Guiana
T2  - TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - A serological. survey for yellow fever virus (YFV), dengue 2 virus (DENV-2), and St Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) was undertaken using a seroneutratization technique in 27 wild forest mammal. species (574 individuals) in French Guiana. Evidence of yellow fever infection was observed in 10 species, with high prevalence recorded in howler monkey (18%) and agouti (20%). Antibodies against DENV-2 and SLEV were found sporadically in various species. This potential host diversity and the range of potential vectors might explain the behaviour of the viruses in epidemic outbreaks and the emergence of periurban loci.

TI  - Case Report: Evidence of Tungiasis in the Amazon Rain Forest of Ecuador
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Tungiasis occurs in tropical and subtropical areas in Central and South America and sub-Saharan Africa and is a Neglected Tropical Disease. We diagnosed three cases of tungiasis in a Dutch family visiting indigenous communities in the Amazon basin of Ecuador. Eight days after returning, they presented papular, pruritic, and painful lesions on the feet, with a whitish halo anda blackish central point with abundant whitish eggs upon extraction. For the first time, we demonstrate that Tunga spp. transmission is present in remote indigenous communities in the Amazon rainforest of Ecuador. It will be important to investigate the occurrence of tungiasis and associated morbidity among local inhabitants and consider prevention measures among locals and travelers to these areas.

TI  - Leukocyte profiles of two neotropical anuran species affected by anthropogenic habitat alteration
T2  - ANIMAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Many amphibian species are vulnerable to environmental changes, especially in the tropics where presumably a large number of species have evolved narrow niches. Rapid environmental changes, such as deforestation, may promote stress responses in anurans that could affect population viability. The stress response in vertebrates is highly conserved, often involving the liberation of glucocorticoids hormones and the recruitment of immune competent cells. The objective of this work was to evaluate leukocyte profiles among individuals of two neotropical anuran species affected by anthropogenic habitat alteration. We took blood samples from adult individuals of Physalaemus cuvieri and Scinax x-signatus in natural and converted habitats in NE Brazil. We analyzed differential leukocyte counts, where increases in neutrophils and decreases in lymphocytes are indicative of a stress response. Specimens of S. x-signatus captured in highly altered habitats presented a higher neutrophil:lymphocyte (N:L) ratios than individuals from natural habitats. In contrast, P. cuvieri individuals exhibited no difference in N:L ratios between habitat types. These results suggest that the immune response depends on the species and the level of habitat alteration. Although S. x-signatus can be considered a generalist species, individuals from this species exhibited increased stress response associated with habitat alteration. The lack of a strong stress response of P. cuvieri, may suggest that this species is more tolerant of habitat alteration or that those individuals have acclimated to anthropogenic stressors more rapidly than S. x-signatus. These variable responses of immune function in highly altered habitats suggest avenues for future experimental work that examines responses to multiple stressors, including disease, which could scale to population trends in altered habitats.

TI  - Comparative Pathogenesis of Alkhumra Hemorrhagic Fever and Kyasanur Forest Disease Viruses in a Mouse Model
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Kyasanur Forest disease virus (KFDV) and Alkhumra hemorrhagic fever virus (AHFV) are genetically closely-related, tick-borne flaviviruses that cause severe, often fatal disease in humans. Flaviviruses in the tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) complex typically cause neurological disease in humans whereas patients infected with KFDV and AHFV predominately present with hemorrhagic fever. A small animal model for KFDV and AHFV to study the pathogenesis and evaluate countermeasures has been lacking mostly due to the need of a high biocontainment laboratory to work with the viruses. To evaluate the utility of an existing mouse model for tick-borne flavivirus pathogenesis, we performed serial sacrifice studies in BALB/c mice infected with either KFDV strain P9605 or AHFV strain Zaki-1. Strikingly, infection with KFDV was completely lethal in mice, while AHFV caused no clinical signs of disease and no animals succumbed to infection. KFDV and high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were detected in the brain at later time points, but no virus was found in visceral organs; conversely, AHFV Zaki-1 and elevated levels of cytokines were found in the visceral organs at earlier time points, but were not detected in the brain. While infection with either virus caused a generalized leukopenia, only AHFV Zaki-1 induced hematologic abnormalities in infected animals. Our data suggest that KFDV P9605 may have lost its ability to cause hemorrhagic disease as the result of multiple passages in suckling mouse brains. However, likely by virtue of fewer mouse passages, AHFV Zaki-1 has retained the ability to replicate in visceral organs, cause hematologic abnormalities, and induce pro-inflammatory cytokines without causing overt disease. Given these striking differences, the use of inbred mice and the virus passage history need to be carefully considered in the interpretation of animal studies using these viruses.

TI  - Canopy tree turnover in old-growth mesic forests of eastern North America
T2  - ECOLOGY
AB  - I studied the dynamic nature of old-growth, eastern U.S. forests by addressing the following questions: (1) How much do stand density, basal area, and size structure vary over rime within several old-growth remnants? (2) How do mortality and growth rates vary with stem size? (3) How much does the importance of individual species vary over time and space? (4) At what rate do snags and stumps form and deteriorate?
   In 1990-1991, I resampled canopy stems within several old-growth remnants in the southern Appalachians, in Hueston Woods State Park, Ohio, and in the Tionesta Scenic and Research Natural Areas, Pennsylvania. I had previously sampled those sites in 1976-1977 using the point-centered quarter method. I remeasured the same trees and measured new trees if the old ones had died or if a new stem closer to the point than the old stem for that quarter had grown to greater than or equal to 25 cm in diameter at breast height.
   Density and basal area changes were small. Density changes equaled -0.33%, -0.52%, and 0.00%/yr for the southern Appalachians, Hueston Woods, and Tionesta sites, respectively. Corresponding basal-area changes were 0.03%, -0.22%, and 0.45%/yr. Mortality increased consistently with stem size in all three areas. However, growth rates of smaller stems more than compensated for the higher mortality rates of larger sterns, so that overall stem size increased between samples. Most species changed little in relative density or basal area. Overall Fagus showed the largest changes between samples, with a small decrease in the southern Appalachians, a larger decrease in Hueston Woods, and an increase in Tionesta. Trees usually died standing, breaking off at a variety of heights. For example, only 6-27% of trees that died were uprooted, depending on region, whereas 16-31% broke at a height of greater than or equal to 16 m. Total snag densities were 15-18 snags/ha.
   In general these stands were marked by slow changes toward fewer, larger stems, even after centuries in which no major disturbances had occurred. However, changes in pathogens, climate, and atmospheric chemistry could change these trends in the future.

TI  - Status and conservation of raptors in Australia's tropics
T2  - JOURNAL OF RAPTOR RESEARCH
CP  - 1996 Joint Meeting of the Raptor-Research-Foundation/American-Ornithologists Union
AB  - All of Australia's 34 raptors are found in the tropics. No full species and only one subspecies, an island endemic owl, are extinct. All of Australia's three threatened, diurnal species are endemic to the continent. Orle, the Vulnerable Red Goshawk (Erythrotriochis radiatus), is endemic to Australia's tropical forests and is under threat from loss of habitat, persecution, and egg collecting. Conservation efforts include legal protection, education, and keeping nest sites secret. A second species, the rare Square-tailed Kite (Lophoictinia isura) is widely distributed and, except for clearing of woodland, threats are not obvious. Many raptors from arid areas, including the endemic Grey Falcon (Falco hypoleucos), "winter" in tropical woodlands. For adequate conservation, critical habitats of. the Grey Falcon must be identified. Grey Falcons should be helped in the long term by the anticipated reduction of rabbits in arid Australia by rabbit calicivirus disease, but widespread clearing of tropical woodlands for agriculture continues as does local, heavy use of pesticides. Although no species of owls are threatened, five subspecies are; two are subspecies of the endemic Rufous Owl (Ninox rufa, one rare and one insufficiently known) and two are subspecies of the Masked Owl (Tyto novaehollandiae, both insufficiently known). Threats include loss of critical habitat to fire and agriculture. On Christmas Island, the small populations of endemic subspecies of the Brown Goshawk (Accipiter fasciatus) and Moluccan Hawk-owl (N. squamipila) are Vulnerable and threatened by loss of habitat to urbanization and formerly mining. Besides legal protection, conservation efforts have included education and habitat preservation. The tropical Eastern Grass-owl (T. longimembris) is secure although some populations are under pressure from agriculture (including rodenticides) and urbanization. Coastal, tropical raptors appear secure even though permanent reductions in some populations have been caused by agriculture, urbanization, and coastal developments such as aquaculture and marinas.

TI  - Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers in Pregnant Women and the Vaccine Landscape: Comparisons Between Yellow Fever, Ebola, and Lassa Fever
T2  - CURRENT TROPICAL MEDICINE REPORTS
AB  - Purpose of ReviewAs research efforts have advanced to understand the pathophysiology of viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHF) and other epidemic viral infections and develop medical countermeasures such as vaccines, pregnant women have remained an underexamined subgroup. To better understand the implications of future outbreaks of VHF for pregnant women amidst an evolving vaccine landscape, we examine three pathogens-yellow fever, Ebola, and Lassa fever-each with different levels of evidence and understanding of disease in pregnancy and at varying stages of vaccine development.Recent FindingsThere are very limited data available on yellow fever disease in pregnancy and the current live-attenuated 17D yellow fever vaccine is recommended for pregnant women at high risk of exposure. Evidence on Ebola virus disease in pregnancy shows very high case fatality rates (CFRs) among pregnant women and their infants, with mixed evidence on whether mortality is higher in pregnant women than non-pregnant adults. The replication-competent rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine is currently being offered to at-risk pregnant women in the Democratic Republic of the Congo after a revision to an earlier protocol that excluded them. For Lassa fever, there is evidence that CFR is higher in pregnant individuals than non-pregnant adults, especially later in gestation, with high rates of fetal or perinatal loss associated with infection. There are currently no Lassa fever vaccine candidates that have been tested in humans.SummaryMore evidence is needed to fully understand the implications of infection in pregnancy, but the existing data underscore the serious maternal and fetal health risks associated with each viral infection. It will also be critical to generate evidence on the safety profile of vaccine candidates as they advance through the pipeline to ensure timely and appropriate access for pregnant women at risk of infection. It is important that pregnant women be considered in the design and clinical trial phases of future vaccines.

TI  - Genetic improvement of tropical acacias: achievements and challenges
T2  - SOUTHERN FORESTS-A JOURNAL OF FOREST SCIENCE
CP  - 1st International Meeting on Sustaining the Future of Acacia Plantation Forestry
AB  - Three acacia species, Acacia auriculiformis, A. crassicarpa and A. mangium, dominate over 2 million ha of tropical acacia plantations worldwide. Species and provenance trials carried out in the 1980s and 1990s established the fastest-growing regions of provenance for each species, and most current breeding populations comprise open-pollinated families from several, or many, local provenances sourced from these favoured regions. Provenance-progeny trials are thinned to seedling seed orchards (SSOs), which yield both selected progenies for the next generation of breeding and operational seed for plantations. Clonal forestry has been successfully developed for A. auriculiformis and the hybrid between A. mangium and A. auriculiformis. In many instances production of improved seed in seed orchards has not been adequate to meet planting demand; strategies to address this have been (1) the establishment of additional unpedigreed seed production areas of broad and superior genetic base, and (2) clonal family forestry to multiply elite seed families. Controlled pollination of acacias is technically demanding, so is not suitable for advancing main breeding populations. Substantial (50-100%) gains in wood volume production have been demonstrated in trials comparing seed from first-generation SSOs or selected clones with inferior provenances and land races, but volume gains in subsequent cycles of breeding will be smaller. The potential for genetic improvement in form traits and wood properties has also been demonstrated. Genetic improvement objectives must now give heavy weighting to improving disease resistance and tolerance. Ganoderma root rot and Ceratocystis stem wilt have destroyed large areas of acacia plantations in Indonesia and Malaysia. Since clonal deployment of resistant genotypes is the quickest and most effective way of delivering resistant planting material, ongoing research to develop clonal forestry for A. crassicarpa and A. mangium is warranted. Novel interspecific hybrid combinations might deliver useful genetic variation for breeding.

TI  - Moonlighting in Rickettsiales: Expanding Virulence Landscape
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE
AB  - The order Rickettsiales includes species that cause a range of human diseases such as human granulocytic anaplasmosis (Anaplasma phagocytophilum), human monocytic ehrlichiosis (Ehrlichia chaffeensis), scrub typhus (Orientia tsutsugamushi), epidemic typhus (Rickettsia prowazekii), murine typhus (R. typhi), Mediterranean spotted fever (R. conorii), or Rocky Mountain spotted fever (R. rickettsii). These diseases are gaining a new momentum given their resurgence patterns and geographical expansion due to the overall rise in temperature and other human-induced pressure, thereby remaining a major public health concern. As obligate intracellular bacteria, Rickettsiales are characterized by their small genome sizes due to reductive evolution. Many pathogens employ moonlighting/multitasking proteins as virulence factors to interfere with multiple cellular processes, in different compartments, at different times during infection, augmenting their virulence. The utilization of this multitasking phenomenon by Rickettsiales as a strategy to maximize the use of their reduced protein repertoire is an emerging theme. Here, we provide an overview of the role of various moonlighting proteins in the pathogenicity of these species. Despite the challenges that lie ahead to determine the multiple potential faces of every single protein in Rickettsiales, the available examples anticipate this multifunctionality as an essential and intrinsic feature of these obligates and should be integrated into available moonlighting repositories.

TI  - Environmental and spatial variables influence the composition of frog assemblages in sub-tropical eastern Australia
T2  - ECOGRAPHY
AB  - In community ecology, contrasting theories suggest that the distribution and abundance of species, and thus the composition of assemblages, are influenced by i) environmental gradients, or ii) contagious biotic processes such as predation, competition, dispersal and disease. In the former case, sites with similar environments would tend to support similar assemblages, while in the latter, geographically proximate sites would tend to support more similar assemblages than widely separated sites. I investigated the relative influence of environmental variables and spatial position on the composition of frog assemblages at forest streams in sub-tropical eastern Australia using redundancy analysis (RDA) and partial RDA. Data on the maximum abundance of the frog species at 65 survey sites were transformed such that RDA would yield the Hellinger distance between sites. The following analysis identified 11 environmental variables that explained 45% of the variation in the abundance of species at the survey sites (the species matrix), as a proportion of total variance. The geographic co-ordinates of the survey sites accounted for 12%, while the environmental and spatial variables combined accounted for 47% of the variation in the species matrix. Partial redundancy analysis indicated that of the explained variation, 74% was purely environmental, 5% was purely spatial and 21% was spatial environmental variation. This study is the first to quantify the relative influence of environmental and spatial variables on the composition of amphibian assemblages. It provides support for both the environmental control model and the biotic control model of species' distributions and assemblage composition, although environmental variables appear to have the greater effect at this scale of analysis.

TI  - IS PLANTATION FORESTRY A WISE INVESTMENT? A PERSPECTIVE FROM MALAYSIA'S INITIATIVES
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL FOREST SCIENCE
AB  - Forest plantations are seen as a potential alternative to natural forest for timber supply. Leaders in forest plantation development include China, India, the Russian Federation, United States and Japan, which accounted for 65% of planted area in 2000. Other countries with increasing forest plantation development include Malaysia. Initiatives for large-scale forest plantation establishment in Malaysia started with an envisaged production of pulp, then second, an effort to augment timber supply with selected fast-growing species within 15 years, and third, to establish 375,000 ha of commercial forest plantation in stages. The first two initiatives ended up as failures due to shortcomings such as seed viability, mismatched downstream industry to the species planted and logistic unfeasibility. The third initiative looks promising as plantations are owned by the industry with the government providing loans and technical assistance. One industry has already entered its third rotation. Large hectarages of land are an advantage to have harvesting in perpetuity based on seven-year rotations. Choosing the right species that matches industry needs, improved planting materials and correct silvicultural practices are important factors, while having integrated downstream processing is an advantage.

TI  - Detection of vegetation changes associated with extensive flooding in a forested ecosystem
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Monitoring broad-scale ecological responses to disturbance can be facilitated by automated change-detection approaches using remotely sensed data. This study evaluated the effectiveness of five unsupervised change-detection techniques using multispectral, multitemporal SPOT High Resolution Visible (HRV) data for identifying vegetation responses to extensive flooding of a forested ecosystem associated with Tropical Storm Alberto in July 1994. Standard statistical techniques, logistic multiple regression, and a probability vector model were used to quantitatively and visually assess classification accuracy.
   The change-detection techniques were (1) spectral-temporal change classification, (2) temporal change classification based on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), (3) principal components analysis (PCA) of spectral data, (4) PCA of NDVI data, and (5) NDVI image differencing. Spectral-temporal change classification was the least effective of the techniques evaluated. Classification accuracy improved when temporal change classification was based on NDVI data. Both PCA methods were more sensitive to flood-affected vegetation than the temporal change classifications based on spectral and NDVI data. Vegetation changes were most accurately identified by image differencing of NDVI data. Logistic multiple regression and a probability vector model were especially useful for relating spectral responses to vegetation changes observed during field surveys and identifying areas of agreement and disagreement among the different classification methods.

TI  - Isolation and characterization of trypanosomatids, including Crithidia mellificae, in bats from the Atlantic Forest of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - We studied infection by Trypanosomatidae in bats captured in two areas with different degradation levels in the Atlantic Forest of Rio de Janeiro state: Reserva Ecologica de Guapiacu (REGUA) and EstacAo Fiocruz Mata Atlantica (EFMA). Furthermore, we evaluated whether the diversity of trypanosomatids changes according to bat diversity and the different levels of preservation in the region. The results showed no influence of the level of preservation on bat species richness (15 and 14 species, respectively), with similar chiropterofauna and higher abundance of two common fruit-eating bat species in the tropics: Carollia perspicillata and Artibeus lituratus. Of the 181 bat specimens analyzed by LIT/Schneider hemoculture, we detected 24 infected individuals (13%), including one positive Sturnira lilium individual that was also positive by fresh blood examination. Molecular characterization using nested PCR targeting the 18 SSU rRNA-encoding gene fragment showed similar trypanosomatid infection rates in bats from the two areas: 15% in REGUA and 11% in EFMA (p = 0.46). Trypanosoma dionisii was the most frequently detected parasite (54%), followed by T. cruzi DTUs TcI and TcIV and Trypanosoma sp., in Neotropical phyllostomid bats (RNMO63 and RNMO56); mixed infections by T. dionisii/T. cruzi TcIII and T. dionisii/T. cruzi TcI were also observed. The T. cruzi DTUs TcI and TcIV are the genotypes currently involved in cases of acute Chagas disease in Brazil, and T. dionisii was recently found in the heart tissue of an infected child. Surprisingly, we also describe for the first time Crithidia mellificae, a putative monoxenous parasite from insects, infecting a vertebrate host in the Americas. Bats from the Atlantic Forest of Rio de Janeiro state harbor a great diversity of trypanosomatids, maintaining trypanosomatid diversity in this sylvatic environment.
   Author summary Among all mammals carrying trypanosomatids, bats are considered some of the most ancient hosts, and due to their good adaptation to different landscape features, they may play an important role in parasite dispersion. To assess whether the diversity of trypanosomatid species in bats is affected by the level of environmental disturbance, we collected blood from bats in two localities of Rio Janeiro state in Brazil: one with high and another with low human interference (more preserved). The collected blood was subjected to fresh blood tests and hemoculture. Using the 18S RNA gene as a molecular target, we identified 24 bats (13%) infected by trypanosomatids, mostly by T. dionisii, a trypanosome species commonly found in all Brazilian biomes and highly associated with bats. Three subpopulations (DTUs I, III and IV) of T. cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas disease, were also found to infect bats. In addition, we detected for the first time a putative insect-associated parasite, Crithidia mellificae, in a mammal host in the Americas. Our work reveals the high diversity of trypanosomatids infecting bats of the Atlantic Forest of Rio de Janeiro state, reinforcing their importance as potential reservoirs of trypanosomatids.

TI  - SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION OF MYCELIA OF THE LIANA (L-) BIOTYPE OF THE AGARIC CRINIPELLIS-PERNICIOSA (STAHEL) SINGER IN TROPICAL FOREST
T2  - NEW PHYTOLOGIST
AB  - A detailed investigation of the liana biotype (L-biotype) of Crinipellis perniciosa (Stahel) Sing. was conducted in Ecuador. Basidiocarps of the L-biotype were consistently found in association with stems or debris of the liana Arvabidaea verrucosa (Standl) A. Gentry, although no symptoms associated with witches' broom disease were observed. Debris colonized by the L-biotype were often connected via pseudosclerotial pads to living stems of A. verrucosa. Pairings between 87 isolates obtained from basidiocarp stipe tissues or liana bark cores from three sites permitted 37 somatic compatibility groupings (SCGs) to be defined. In all cases these were found to be very restricted in geographical distribution, a situation which contrasts markedly with the distribution of SCGs in the pathogenic and non-outcrossing cocoa biotype. Mating pairings between single basidiospore isolates confirmed that the outcrossing mechanism of the L-biotype is multiallelic and that no significant biological barriers to gene flow exist between coastal and Amazonian populations. Several lines of evidence suggested that mycelia belonging to the same SCG (= genet) were isogenic. Correlations between field observations and the distributions of both SCGs and mating type factors are discussed in relation to patterns of dispersal, establishment and spread of this fungus.

TI  - OCULAR ONCHOCERCIASIS AND INTENSITY OF INFECTION IN THE COMMUNITY .3. WEST AFRICAN RAIN-FOREST FOCI OF THE VECTOR SIMULIUM-SANCTIPAULI
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND PARASITOLOGY
AB  - The community pattern of ocular onchocerciasis is described for 11 villages from the forest area in Cote d'Ivoire where S. sanctipauli is the princial vector.  An analytical method is applied which relates indices of ocular onchocerciasis with the Community Microfilarial Load (CMFL) and compares the results with the ocular onchocerciasis pattern found in the West African savanna. In spite of high transmission levels as estimated by entomological indices, the CMFLs were relatively low which complicated the characterization of the ocular disease pattern.  Nevertheless, it could be shown that ocular onchocerciasis is less severe in the Sanctipauli forest than in the savanna, even after correction for differences in CMFL.  The prevalence of onchocercal eye lesions and blindness were low and advanced sclerosing keratitis was completely absent.
   The differences are explained by presuming strain differences of the parasite Onchocerca volvulus.  For given CMFLs the mean microfilarial loads in the eye were significantly lower than in the savanna which suggests that the parasite strain in the Sanctipauli forest is less invasive to the eye.  Ocular microfilarial loads were too low to determine if the parasite is also less pathogenic to the eye, as has been concluded previously for foci of S. yahense, but this possibility cannot be excluded.

TI  - "Random-flight' dispersal in tropical fruit-feeding butterflies? High mobility, long lifespans and no home ranges
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - 1. Tropical fruit-feeding Nymphalidae butterflies are widely used in research, monitoring, and conservation projects, but to date a key aspect of their behaviour-dispersal-remains poorly understood. They have anecdotally been described as relatively sedentary' based on movement vectors from mark-recapture studies, but this may be inaccurate because plot-based studies in small sampling areas often underrepresent long-distance movements. 2. Based on data from a peat-swamp forest in Borneo, it was found that these butterflies may be much more mobile than previously thought, as they frequently moved distances of 1-2km between sampling plots. Median daily movements were approximately 200-250m, and over lifespans of one or more months these movements may sum to total life-time dispersals of several kilometres. 3. Recapture rates for long-distance movements between sampling plots were between 28.2% and 41.6% of the re-encounter rates that would be predicted by a random-walk approximation/Brownian motion (without accounting for survival rates), supporting the hypothesis that it is a suitable model of dispersal in this group, although further research is needed to confirm this. 4. There was no evidence that butterflies occupied permanent home ranges, and it is suggested that a permanent home range or territorial behaviour would be maladaptive in this group. Pseudo-replication caused by trap-happy' behaviour was not found to be widespread, and some recommendations are provided regarding the treatment of recapture data in trap-based studies. 5. These findings substantially increase the spatial parameters for future research and conservation projects in this group and are also applicable to theoretical modelling studies. An abstract for this article in Bahasa Indonesia is included in the online supporting information File S1.

TI  - Environmental Factors Linked to Reporting of Active Malaria Foci in Thailand
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE
AB  - Thailand has made substantial progress towards malaria elimination, with 46 of the country's 77 provinces declared malaria-free as part of the subnational verification program. Nonetheless, these areas remain vulnerable to the reintroduction of malaria parasites and the reestablishment of indigenous transmission. As such, prevention of reestablishment (POR) planning is of increasing concern to ensure timely response to increasing cases. A thorough understanding of both the risk of parasite importation and receptivity for transmission is essential for successful POR planning. Routine geolocated case- and foci-level epidemiological and case-level demographic data were extracted from Thailand's national malaria information system for all active foci from October 2012 to September 2020. A spatial analysis examined environmental and climate factors associated with the remaining active foci. A logistic regression model collated surveillance data with remote sensing data to investigate associations with the probability of having reported an indigenous case within the previous year. Active foci are highly concentrated along international borders, particularly Thailand's western border with Myanmar. Although there is heterogeneity in the habitats surrounding active foci, land covered by tropical forest and plantation was significantly higher for active foci than other foci. The regression results showed that tropical forest, plantations, forest disturbance, distance from international borders, historical foci classification, percentage of males, and percentage of short-term residents were associated with the high probability of reporting indigenous cases. These results confirm that Thailand's emphasis on border areas and forest-going populations is well placed. The results suggest that environmental factors alone are not driving malaria transmission in Thailand; rather, other factors, including demographics and behaviors that intersect with exophagic vectors, may also be contributors. However, these factors are syndemic, so human activities in areas covered by tropical forests and plantations may result in malaria importation and, potentially, local transmission, in foci that had previously been cleared. These factors should be addressed in POR planning.

TI  - In the Footsteps of Cows: Using Livestock Tracing Technology to Trace and Predict New Weed Incursions of Tropical Soda Apple (<i>Solanum viarum</i>) in Australia
T2  - INVASIVE PLANT SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Tropical soda apple is an aggressive prickly perennial shrub growing up to 2 m high. It invades open to semishaded areas, including pastures, forests, riparian zones, roadsides, recreational areas, and horticultural and cropping areas. In Australia during August 2010, the weed was identified on the New South Wales Mid North Coast. It is believed that tropical soda apple has been present in this area for a number of years and both systematic and ad hoc surveys have found the weed in other satellite locations. The discovery of tropical soda apple at several cattle handling facilities indicated that cattle are a significant vector for the weed. The aim of this project was to use the National Livestock Identification System (NLIS) data to trace cattle movements from affected properties throughout New South Wales and into other Australian states. This has proved advantageous, as there are few other nonecological mechanisms to systematically trace significant weed movement. We have been able to conduct a pathway analysis of where this weed is likely to occur across New South Wales through the use of NLIS. Importantly, we can use this information to pinpoint surveillance activities for local managers, thus ensuring better use of resources. We have also been able to create a stochastic model for incursions at these sites using information gleaned from the NLIS data.

TI  - Riding the wave: Reconciling the roles of disease and climate change in amphibian declines
T2  - PLOS BIOLOGY
AB  - We review the evidence for the role of climate change in triggering disease outbreaks of chytridiomycosis, an emerging infectious disease of amphibians. Both climatic anomalies and disease-related extirpations are recent phenomena, and effects of both are especially noticeable at high elevations in tropical areas, making it difficult to determine whether they are operating separately or synergistically. We compiled reports of amphibian declines from Lower Central America and Andean South America to create maps and statistical models to test our hypothesis of spatiotemporal spread of the pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), and to update the elevational patterns of decline in frogs belonging to the genus Atelopus. We evaluated claims of climate change influencing the spread of Bd by including error into estimates of the relationship between air temperature and last year observed. Available data support the hypothesis of multiple introductions of this invasive pathogen into South America and subsequent spread along the primary Andean cordilleras. Additional analyses found no evidence to support the hypothesis that climate change has been driving outbreaks of amphibian chytridiomycosis, as has been posited in the climate-linked epidemic hypothesis. Future studies should increase retrospective surveys of museum specimens from throughout the Andes and should study the landscape genetics of Bd to map fine-scale patterns of geographic spread to identify transmission routes and processes.

TI  - Landscape Changes Influence the Occurrence of the Melioidosis Bacterium <i>Burkholderia pseudomallei</i> in Soil in Northern Australia
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background: The soil-dwelling saprophyte bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei is the cause of melioidosis, a severe disease of humans and animals in southeast Asia and northern Australia. Despite the detection of B. pseudomallei in various soil and water samples from endemic areas, the environmental habitat of B. pseudomallei remains unclear.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We performed a large survey in the Darwin area in tropical Australia and screened 809 soil samples for the presence of these bacteria. B. pseudomallei were detected by using a recently developed and validated protocol involving soil DNA extraction and real-time PCR targeting the B. pseudomallei-specific Type III Secretion System TTS1 gene cluster. Statistical analyses such as multivariable cluster logistic regression and principal component analysis were performed to assess the association of B. pseudomallei with environmental factors. The combination of factors describing the habitat of B. pseudomallei differed between undisturbed sites and environmentally manipulated areas. At undisturbed sites, the occurrence of B. pseudomallei was found to be significantly associated with areas rich in grasses, whereas at environmentally disturbed sites, B. pseudomallei was associated with the presence of livestock animals, lower soil pH and different combinations of soil texture and colour.
   Conclusions/Significance: This study contributes to the elucidation of environmental factors influencing the occurrence of B. pseudomallei and raises concerns that B. pseudomallei may spread due to changes in land use.

TI  - Humans frequently exposed to a range of non-human primate malaria parasite species through the bites of <i>Anopheles dirus</i> mosquitoes in South-central Vietnam
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
AB  - Background: Recent studies have described natural human infections of the non-human primate parasites Plasmodium knowlesi and Plasmodium cynomolgi. In Southeast Asia, mosquitoes of the Anopheles leucosphyrus group bite both humans and monkeys in the forest and thus offer a possible route for Plasmodium species to bridge the species barrier. In this study we analysed the species composition of malarial sporozoites infecting the salivary glands of Anopheles dirus in order to determine their potential role as bridge vectors of Plasmodium parasites from monkeys to humans.
   Methods: Mosquitoes were collected in the forest and forest fringe area of Khanh Phu commune by human-baited landing collection. Anopheles species were determined on the basis of morphologic features. Sporozoite-infected salivary glands were applied to filter paper and dried in an ambient atmosphere, before storage in closed vials at 4-6 degrees C. Detection and identification of Plasmodium species in salivary glands were carried out by nested-PCR of the small subunit ribosomal RNA gene.
   Results: Six species of Plasmodium parasites were detected by PCR, of which P. vivax was the most common, followed by P. knowlesi, P. inui, P. cynomolgi, P. coatneyi and P. falciparum. Twenty-six of the 79 sporozoite infected mosquitoes showed multiple infections, most of which were a combination of P. vivax with one or more of the non-human primate Plasmodium species.
   Conclusions: These results suggest that humans overnighting in this forest are frequently inoculated with both human and non-human primate malaria parasites, leading to a situation conducive for the emergence of novel zoonotic malaria.

TI  - Combinations of Feature Selection and Machine Learning Algorithms for Object-Oriented Betel Palms and Mango Plantations Classification Based on Gaofen-2 Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Betel palms and mango plantations are two crucial commercial crops in tropical agricultural areas. Accurate spatial distributions of these two crops are essential in tropical agricultural regional planning and management. However, the characteristics of small patches, scattering, and perennation make it challenging to map betel palms and mango plantations in complex tropical agricultural regions. Furthermore, the excessive features of very-high-resolution (VHR) imaging might lead to a reduction in classification accuracy and an increase in computation times. To address these challenges, we selected five feature selection (FS) methods (random forest means a decrease in accuracy (RFMDA), ReliefF, random forest-recursive feature elimination (RFE), aggregated boosted tree (ABT), and logistic regression (LR)) and four machine learning algorithms (random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), classification and regression tree (CART), and adaptive boosting (AdaBoost)). Then, the optimal combinations of FS and machine learning algorithms suited for object-oriented classification of betel palms and mango plantations were explored using VHR Gaofen-2 imagery. In terms of overall accuracy, all optimal classification schemes exceeded 80%, and the classifiers using selected features increased the overall accuracy between 1% and 4% compared with classification without FS methods. Specifically, LR was appropriate to RF and SVM classifiers, which produced the highest classification accuracy (89.1% and 89.88% for RF and SVM, respectively). In contrast, ABT and ReliefF were found to be suitable FS methods for CART and AdaBoost classifiers, respectively. Overall, all four optimal combinations of FS methods and classifiers could precisely recognize mango plantations, whereas betel palms were best depicted by using the RF-LR method with 26 features. The results indicated that combination of feature selection and machine learning algorithms contributed to the object-oriented classification of complex tropical crops using Gaofen-2 imagery, which provide a useful methodological reference for precisely recognizing small tropical agricultural patterns.

TI  - Release of microplastics from disposable face mask in tropical climate
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
AB  - Outbreak of COVID 19 has caused an abrupt surge in the consumption of disposable face masks around the world. WHO has stated that wearing a face mask in public reduces the chances of being exposed to COVID 19 virus. With unchecked disposal of these used masks, a new kind of pollutant has emerged in the environment. Since these masks are generally made of polypropylene and polyurethane material, they can be considered as a potential source of microplastics (MPs) in the environment. In this study, we have evaluated the release of MPs particles from these face masks (namely from N95 and surgical masks) in deionized (DI) water and tap water over the span of 1 to 180 days. More specifically, a systematic study has been carried out to see the effect of temperature on release of MPs in water. MPs particles released in tap water (837 +/- 113 particles/piece in 30 days) were significantly higher than that in DI water (564 +/- 37 particles/piece in 30 days). When these masks were kept at a constant temperature of 45 degrees C for 30 Days, highest amount of MPs release (N95 899 +/- 65 particles, Surgical 1038 +/- 65 particles/piece) was observed as compared to other conditions. Most of the MPs particles released were polypropylene which were transparent and white in case of N95 while for surgical mask they were found to be of blue and white colour. With the aging of masks in water, quantity of MPs release was increased with simultaneous reduction in their size. Our study indicates that these disposable face masks are emerging to be a prominent source of MPs release in the environment and more hazardous for the tropical climate.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Bats are rare reservoirs of <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> complex in Gabon
T2  - INFECTION GENETICS AND EVOLUTION
AB  - The colonization of afro-tropical wildlife with Staphylococcus aureus and the derived clade Staphylococcus schweitzeri remains largely unknown. A reservoir in bats could be of importance since bats and humans share overlapping habitats. In addition, bats are food sources in some African regions and can be the cause of zoonotic diseases. Here, we present a cross-sectional survey employing pharyngeal swabs of captured and released bats (n = 133) in a forest area of Gabon. We detected low colonization rates of S. aureus (4-6%) and S. schweitzeri (4%) in two out of four species of fruit bats, namely Rousettus aegyptiacus and Micropteropus pusillus, but not in insectivorous bats. Multilocus sequence typing showed that S. aureus from Gabonese bats (ST2984, ST3259, ST3301, ST3302) were distinct from major African human associated clones (ST15, ST121, ST152). S. schweitzeri from bats (ST1697, ST1700) clustered with S. schweitzeri from other species (bats, monkeys) from Nigeria and Cote d'Ivoire.
   In conclusion, colonization rates of bats with S. aureus and S. schweitzeri were low in our study. Phylogenetic analysis supports an intense geographical dispersal of S. schweitzeri among different mammalian wildlife hosts. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Vertical Distribution of Oviposition and Temporal Segregation of Arbovirus Vector Mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) in a Fragment of the Atlantic Forest, State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE
AB  - Culicid species, which include potential vectors of yellow fever, are diverse and abundant, with species commonly co-occurring in certain sites. Studying these species can provide important insights into their vector potential and, consequently, epizootic cycles of arboviruses carried about by these vectors. Here, we evaluated the vertical distribution and temporal segregation of mosquito oviposition with emphasis on arbovirus vectors in a fragment of the Atlantic Forest in Casimiro de Abreu, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Two sampling points were selected: Fazenda Tres Montes and the Reserva Natural de Propriedade Privada Morro Grande. Collections were carried out at two sites using 10 ovitraps installed on the vegetation cover at different heights (0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 m above ground level) and monitored monthly from July 2018 to December 2020. The hypotheses of temporal and vertical stratification were tested through a PERMANOVA, and the relationship of each species with the vertical distribution was evaluated individually through a correlation analysis. We collected a total of 3075 eggs, including four species of medical importance: Haemagogus leucocelaenus (n = 1513), Haemagogus janthinomys (n = 16), Aedes albopictus (n = 1097), and Aedes terrens (n = 449). We found that Hg. leucocelaenus had a positive relationship with height, exhibiting behavior that appears to benefit from higher heights. The abundance of Ae. terrens seemed to follow Hg. leucocelaenus, although we did not find a relationship with height for the former species. On the other hand, Ae. albopictus exhibited a negative relationship with height, becoming absent or outnumbered at higher strata. Our study site has already presented evidence of recent transmission of the wild yellow fever virus, supporting the need to carefully monitor the emergence of febrile diseases among residents in the surrounding areas and the local population.

TI  - Vulnerabilities to and the Socioeconomic and Psychosocial Impacts of the Leishmaniases: A Review
T2  - RESEARCH AND REPORTS IN TROPICAL MEDICINE
AB  - The leishmaniases are a group of four vector-borne neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) with 1.6 billion people in some 100 countries at risk. They occur in certain eco-epidemiological foci that reflect manipulation by human activities, such as migration, urbanization and deforestation, of which poverty, conflict and climate change are key drivers. Given their synergistic impacts, risk factors and the vulnerabilities of poor populations and the launch of a new 2030 roadmap for NTDs in the context of the global sustainability agenda, it is warranted to update the state of knowledge of the leishmaniases and their effects. Using existing literature, we review socioeconomic and psychosocial impacts of leishmaniasis within a framework of risk factors and vulnerabilities to help inform policy interventions. Studies show that poverty is an overarching primary risk factor. Low-income status fosters inadequate housing, malnutrition and lack of sanitation, which create and exacerbate complexities in access to care and treatment outcomes as well as education and awareness. The co-occurrence of the leishmaniases with malnutrition and HIV infection further complicate diagnosis and treatment, leading to poor diagnostic outcomes and therapeutic response. Even with free treatment, households may suffer catastrophic health expenditure from direct and indirect medical costs, which compounds existing financial strain in low-income communities for households and healthcare systems. The dermatological presentations of the leishmaniases may result in long-term severe disfigurement, leading to stigmatization, reduced quality of life, discrimination and mental health issues. A substantial amount of recent literature points to the vulnerability pathways and burden of leishmaniasis on women, in particular, who disproportionately suffer from these impacts. These emerging foci demonstrate a need for continued international efforts to address key risk factors and population vulnerabilities if leishmaniasis control, and ultimately elimination, is to be achieved by 2030.

TI  - Importance of sample size, data type and prediction method for remote sensing-based estimations of aboveground forest biomass
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Estimates of forest biomass are needed for various technical and scientific applications, ranging from carbon and bioenergy policies to sustainable forest management. As local measurements are costly, there is a great interest in obtaining reliable estimates over large areas from remote sensing data. Currently, such estimates are obtained with a variety of data sources, statistical methods and prediction standards, and there is no agreement on what are best practices for this task.
   To improve our understanding of how these different methods affect prediction quality, we first conducted a systematic review of the available literature to identify the most common sensor types and prediction methods. Based on the review, we identified sample size of the reference points on the ground, prediction method (step-wise linear regression, support vector machines, random forest, Gaussian processes and k-nearest neighbor), and sensor type as the main differences that could potentially affect predictive quality. We then compared those factors in two case study areas in Germany and Chile, for which airborne discrete return Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) and airborne hyperspectral as well as airborne discrete return LiDAR and spaceborne hyperspectral data were available. For each factor combination, we calculated Pearson's coefficient of correlation between observations and predictions (r(2)) and root mean squared error (RMSE) for bootstrapped estimates using k-fold cross-validation with a varying number of folds. Finally, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was used to quantify the influence of the factors on the predictive error of the biomass models.
   Our results confirm previous findings that predictor data (sensor) type is the most important factor for the accuracy of biomass estimates, with LiDAR being preferable to hyperspectral data. In contrast to some previous studies, complementing LiDAR with hyperspectral data did not improve predictive accuracy. Also the prediction method had a substantial effect on accuracy and was generally more important than the sample size. In most cases, random forest performed best and stepwise linear models worst, judging from r(2) and RMSE under cross-validation. Additional results suggested that r(2) may deliver unrealistically large values when the hold-out sample during the cross-validation is too small.
   In conclusion, our literature review revealed that different methods for biomass estimation are currently used, with no general agreement on best practices. In our case studies, we found substantial accuracy differences between those methods, with LiDAR data, in combination with a random forest algorithm and a large number of reference sample units on the ground yielding the lowest error for biomass predictions. The comparatively high importance of the statistical prediction method seems particularly relevant, as they suggest that choosing the appropriate statistical method may be more effective than obtaining additional field data for obtaining good biomass estimates. Considering the costs of improving accuracy of global and regional biomass estimates by ground measurements, it seems sensible to invest in further comparative studies, preferably with a wider range of sites and including also RADAR sensors, to establish robust best-practice recommendations for obtaining regional and global biomass estimates from remote-sensing data.

TI  - Climate change and health: global to local influences on disease risk
T2  - ANNALS OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND PARASITOLOGY
AB  - The World Health Organization has concluded that the climatic changes that have occurred since the mid 1970s could already be causing annually over 150,000 deaths and five million disability-adjusted life-years (DALY), mainly in developing countries. The less developed countries are, ironically, those least responsible for causing global warming. Many health outcomes and diseases are sensitive to climate, including: heat-related mortality or morbidity; air pollution-related illnesses; infectious diseases, particularly those transmitted, indirectly, via water or by insect or rodent vectors; and refugee health issues linked to forced population migration. Yet, changing landscapes can significantly affect local weather more acutely than long-term climate change. Land-cover change can influence micro-climatic conditions, including temperature, evapo-transpiration and surface run-off, that are key determinants in the emergence of many infectious diseases. To improve risk assessment and risk management of these synergistic processes (climate and land-use change), more collaborative efforts in research, training and policy-decision support, across the fields of health, environment, sociology and economics, are required.

TI  - A new screening method for <i>Ganoderma philippii</i> tolerance in tropical <i>Acacia</i> species
T2  - SOUTHERN FORESTS-A JOURNAL OF FOREST SCIENCE
CP  - 1st International Meeting on Sustaining the Future of Acacia Plantation Forestry
AB  - Red root rot disease caused by Ganoderma philippii is one of the most economically important diseases of tropical Acacia species. Research on field control of the disease has to date focused on inoculum reduction, silviculture practices and application of biological control agents. Incorporation of tolerant genotypes, a key component of integrated disease management, has not been adequately explored because of a lack of reliable and quick screening protocols. Recently, we developed a more rapid method of screening for red root rot tolerance in Acacia mangium, A. crassicarpa and A. mangium. A. auriculiformis hybrid planting stock, in which groups of five, 6-week-old plants were subjected to inoculum consisting of a rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) wood block culture of the pathogen held within a polythene bag. As symptoms start to appear 10 weeks after inoculation, experiments can be completed in a six-month period instead of the years needed by the traditional pot system. Using this technique we were able to identify variations in tolerance and/ or susceptibility to G. philippii in A. mangium, A. crassicarpa and A. mangium. A. auriculiformis hybrid planting stock in a more consistent manner. Tolerant and susceptible genotypes subsequently have been selected for further experiments or crosses. While the ultimate goal of this study was to develop and deploy high-yielding Acacia genotypes that are also tolerant to red root rot disease, results of the current screening studies may also be used to investigate the basis for tolerance to G. philippii in Acacia species.

TI  - YEAST POPULATIONS ON THE TROPICAL TIMBER TREE SPECIES MILICIA-EXCELSA
T2  - LETTERS IN APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Yeast populations found on the tropical timber tree species Milicia excelsa showed very little diversity at the genus and species level, Of 62 isolates, 87% were Cryptococcus laurentii, 5% Candida humicola, 3% Candida curvata, 1.5% Candida membranaefaciens, 1.5% Rhodotorula minuta and 1.5% Rhodotorula rubra. Approximately half of the Crypt. laurentii strains had unusual metabolic profiles when compared with the Crypt. laurentii strains in the profile library of the APILAB yeast identification software. All isolated strains were non-pathogenic and did not show antagonism against Botrytis cinerea in an in vitro plate assay, However, three strains of Crypt. laurentii suppressed disease development of B. cinerea in a leaf disk bio-assay, This indicates that protection of leaves against opportunistic fungal diseases may be part of the ecological function of Crypt, laurentii populations on Milicia leaves and the potential of this yeast species for biological control.

TI  - Fine-scale variation in malaria prevalence across ecological regions in Madagascar: a cross-sectional study
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - BackgroundLarge-scale variation in ecological parameters across Madagascar is hypothesized to drive varying spatial patterns of malaria infection. However, to date, few studies of parasite prevalence with resolution at finer, sub-regional spatial scales are available. As a result, there is a poor understanding of how Madagascar's diverse local ecologies link with variation in the distribution of infections at the community and household level. Efforts to preserve Madagascar's ecological diversity often focus on improving livelihoods in rural communities near remaining forested areas but are limited by a lack of data on their infectious disease burden.MethodsTo investigate spatial variation in malaria prevalence at the sub-regional scale in Madagascar, we sampled 1476 households (7117 total individuals, all ages) from 31 rural communities divided among five ecologically distinct regions. The sampled regions range from tropical rainforest to semi-arid, spiny forest and include communities near protected areas including the Masoala, Makira, and Mikea forests. Malaria prevalence was estimated by rapid diagnostic test (RDT) cross-sectional surveys performed during malaria transmission seasons over 2013-2017.ResultsIndicative of localized hotspots, malaria prevalence varied more than 10-fold between nearby (<50km) communities in some cases. Prevalence was highest on average in the west coast region (Morombe district, average community prevalence 29.4%), situated near protected dry deciduous forest habitat. At the household level, communities in southeast Madagascar (Mananjary district) were observed with over 50% of households containing multiple infected individuals at the time of sampling. From simulations accounting for variation in household size and prevalence at the community level, we observed a significant excess of households with multiple infections in rural communities in southwest and southeast Madagascar, suggesting variation in risk within communities.ConclusionsOur data suggest that the malaria infection burden experienced by rural communities in Madagascar varies greatly at smaller spatial scales (i.e., at the community and household level) and that the southeast and west coast ecological regions warrant further attention from disease control efforts. Conservation and development efforts in these regions may benefit from consideration of the high, and variable, malaria prevalences among communities in these areas.

T2  - FOREST PATHOLOGY
AB  - Increased diseases outbreaks inGmelina arborea(melina) are a threat to sustainability of commercial plantations. One main disease, known as 'melina sudden death', limits the growth and development of trees, causing losses of up to 40% in commercial plantation. However, the main cause of this disease was unknown, until now. Proof ofCeratocystis fimbriataas the aetiological agent of 'melina sudden death' is provided based on field records of disease symptoms, histopathological observation of infected tissue, morphological features of the fungus, maximum-likelihood phylogenetic inference of the ITS rDNA sequences and pathogenicity test conducted on GENFORES elite melina genotypes. Thus, the appropriate name for the disease should be Ceratocystis wilt. As far as we know, this is the first report of Ceratocystis wilt in melina caused byCeratocystis fimbriatain Central America. This disease represents a serious threat to Costa Rica's forest industry, as well as in other Latin American countries.

TI  - Introduction of rootrainer technology in forestry - Impact on nursery disease management
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 4TH MEETING OF IUFRO WORKING PARTY 7.03.04 - DISEASE AND INSECTS IN FOREST NURSERIES
CP  - 4th Meeting of the IUFRO Working Party 7 03 04
AB  - Recently, rootrainer technology has been introduced in the forestry sector in India to raise healthy planting stock for afforestation and reforestation. Even though the new technology requires high initial investments, it offers many advantages over the conventional methods of raising and maintaining the nurseries. In conventional forest nurseries, diseases pose a major threat and epidemic outbreaks of diseases like seedling blight caused by Cylindrocladium spp. and web blight caused by Rhizoctonia solani often cause partial to complete failure of nurseries, especially in high rainfall areas. However, information is scanty on the disease situation in rootrainer raised forestry species under the tropical humid climatic conditions. Disease monitoring in rootrainer nurseries as well as conventional seedbed and polythene container nurseries situated in different Forest Divisions in Kerala State during 1997-99 revealed that seedlings of all the forest tree species raised in conventional nurseries succumbed to one or other diseases at their different growth phases. While seedlings of the same species raised in rootrainers under similar climatic conditions failed to show any serious infections. Soil-borne fungal diseases like damping-off, web blight, collar rot, and seedling blight seldom occurred in rootrainer seedlings. Moreover, Eucalyptus grandis and E. tereticornis rootrainer seedlings were found totally free from Cylindrocladium seedling blight, the most dreaded disease of eucalypts in the State. Though, the new nursery technology offers production of healthy planting stock, reduction of seedling maintenance period and minimization of disease hazards in forest nurseries, efficiency optimization based on tree species raised, planting techniques followed and local climatic conditions is warranted.

TI  - Reproductive biology of columnar cacti: are bats the only protagonists in the pollination of <i>Pilosocereus</i>, a typical chiropterophilous genus?
T2  - FOLIA GEOBOTANICA
AB  - The Cactaceae display a wide array of pollination systems, with many different animals already confirmed as pollinators. Pilosocereus is one of the most conspicuous bat-pollinated genera characteristic of the tropical dry forests of Brazil, known as Caatinga. The role of bats, hawkmoths and bees as pollinators in natural populations was investigated for four Pilosocereus species (P. catingicola, P. chrysostele, P. gounellei and P. pachycladus). Earlier results obtained with P. tuberculatus were also included in the comparative discussion. These species depend mainly upon nocturnal visitors; however, Xylocopa grisescens bees also play a secondary role in the fruit set. Although chiropterophily is predominant in Pilosocereus, P. gounellei was visited and pollinated at night exclusively by sphingids. All species are described as presenting a chiropterophilous syndrome based on their nocturnal anthesis, strong and unpleasant flower scent, pale, white or cream inner perianth, compact and abundant flower parts, and large volume of nectar with low sugar concentration. Pollen is available and the stigma is receptive throughout anthesis. With the exception of P. gounellei, there was no fruit set from spontaneous or manual self-pollination, indicating that allogamy is the predominant reproductive system in all the species studied. These species thus rely on animals that function as efficient pollen vectors for their sexual reproduction. The Pilosocereus species present different levels of dependence on bats, from the participation of secondary pollinators to not being visited by bats at all. Dependence levels are associated with the species floral attributes, which, although subdued, can determine different pollination systems.

AB  - Onchocerciasis is a neglected tropical disease (NTD) caused by Onchocerca Diesing 1841 (Spirurida: Onchocercidae) nematodes transmitted by blackflies. It is associated with poverty and imposes a significant health, welfare and economic burden on many tropical countries. Current methods to visualize infections within the vectors rely on invasive methods. However, using micro-computed tomography techniques, without interference from physical tissue manipulation, we visualized in three dimensions for the first time an L1 larva of an Onchocerca species within the thoracic musculature of a blackfly, Simulium damnosum s.l. Theobald 1903 (Diptera: Simuliidae), naturally infected in Ghana. The possibility that thicker peritrophic membranes in savannah flies could account for their lower parasite loads was not supported, but there were limits to our analysis. While there were no statistically significant differences between the mean thicknesses of the peritrophic membranes, in the anterior, dorsal and ventral regions, of forest and savannah blackflies killed 34-48 min after a blood-meal, the thickness of the peritrophic membrane in the posterior region could not be measured. Micro-computed tomography has the potential to provide novel information on many other parasite/vector systems and impactful images for public engagement in health education.

TI  - The genomic signal of local environmental adaptation in <i>Aedes aegypti</i> mosquitoes
T2  - EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS
AB  - Local adaptation is important when predicting arthropod-borne disease risk because of its impacts on vector population fitness and persistence. However, the extent that vector populations are adapted to the environment generally remains unknown. Despite low population structure and high gene flow in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes across Panama, excepting the province of Bocas del Toro, we identified 128 candidate SNPs, clustered within 17 genes, which show a strong genomic signal of local environmental adaptation. This putatively adaptive variation occurred across fine geographical scales with the composition and frequency of candidate adaptive loci differing between populations in wet tropical environments along the Caribbean coast and dry tropical conditions typical of the Pacific coast. Temperature and vegetation were important predictors of adaptive genomic variation in Ae. aegypti with several potential areas of local adaptation identified. Our study lays the foundations of future work to understand whether environmental adaptation in Ae. aegypti impacts the arboviral disease landscape and whether this could either aid or hinder efforts of population control.

TI  - German <i>Culex pipiens</i> biotype <i>molestus</i> and <i>Culex torrentium</i> are vector-competent for Usutu virus
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
AB  - Background Usutu virus (USUV) is a rapidly spreading zoonotic arbovirus (arthropod-borne virus) and a considerable threat to the global avifauna and in isolated cases to human health. It is maintained in an enzootic cycle involving ornithophilic mosquitoes as vectors and birds as reservoir hosts. Despite massive die-offs in wild bird populations and the detection of severe neurological symptoms in infected humans, little is known about which mosquito species are involved in the propagation of USUV. Methods In the present study, the vector competence of a German (i.e. "Central European") and a Serbian (i.e. "Southern European") Culex pipiens biotype molestus laboratory colony was experimentally evaluated. For comparative purposes, Culex torrentium, a frequent species in Northern Europe, and Aedes aegypti, a primarily tropical species, were also tested. Adult female mosquitoes were exposed to bovine blood spiked with USUV Africa 2 and subsequently incubated at 25 degrees C. After 2 to 3 weeks saliva was collected from each individual mosquito to assess the ability of a mosquito species to transmit USUV. Results Culex pipiens biotype molestus mosquitoes originating from Germany and the Republic of Serbia and Cx. torrentium mosquitoes from Germany proved competent for USUV, as indicated by harboring viable virus in their saliva 21 days post infection. By contrast, Ae. aegypti mosquitoes were relatively refractory to an USUV infection, exhibiting low infection rates and lacking virus in their saliva. Conclusions Consistent with the high prevalences and abundances of Cx. pipiens biotype molestus and Cx. torrentium in Central and Northern Europe, these two species have most likely played a historic role in the spread, maintenance, and introduction of USUV into Germany. Identification of the key USUV vectors enables the establishment and implementation of rigorous entomological surveillance programs and the development of effective, evidence-based vector control interventions.

TI  - Monitoring mangrove forests: Are we taking full advantage of technology?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
AB  - Mangrove forests grow in the estuaries of 124 tropical countries around the world. Because in-situ monitoring of mangroves is difficult and time-consuming, remote sensing technologies are commonly used to monitor these ecosystems. Landsat satellites have provided regular and systematic images of mangrove ecosystems for over 30 years, yet researchers often cite budget and infrastructure constraints to justify the underuse this resource. Since 2001, over 50 studies have used Landsat or ASTER imagery for mangrove monitoring, and most focus on the spatial extent of mangroves, rarely using more than five images. Even after the Landsat archive was made free for public use, few studies used more than five images, despite the clear advantages of using more images (e.g. lower signal-to-noise ratios). The main argument of this paper is that, with freely available imagery and high performance computing facilities around the world, it is up to researchers to acquire the necessary programming skills to use these resources. Programming skills allow researchers to automate repetitive and time-consuming tasks, such as image acquisition and processing, consequently reducing up to 60% of the time dedicated to these activities. These skills also help scientists to review and re-use algorithms, hence making mangrove research more agile. This paper contributes to the debate on why scientists need to learn to program, not only to challenge prevailing approaches to mangrove research, but also to expand the temporal and spatial extents that are commonly used for mangrove research.

T2  - INTEGRATED PLANT DISEASE MANAGEMENT
CP  - Symposium on Challenging Problems in Horticultural and Forest Pathology
AB  - Tomato is an important cash crop of Himachal Pradesh and also an important economic horticultural crop of many other tropical and subtropical countries. The chracterization of a potyviriis causing mosaic disease in tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) in Himachal Pradesh, was carried out by studying symptomatology, transmission, host range, biophysical properties, particle morphology, cytopathology and immuno electron microscopy. The symptoms produced by the virus were vein- clearing, mild mosaic, downward rolling of leaves and reduction in size of the leaves. The virus isolate was found to be transmissible through sap and aphid vectors viz., Myzus persicae, Aphis craccivora and Aphis gossypii. The virus has a narrow host range restricted to a few members of the family solanaceae. The virus remained infectious in dilution between 10(-3) to 10(-4), upon storage for 72 h at room temperature (24-29 degrees C), 120 h at 5 +/- 10 degrees C and when heated for ten minutes.

TI  - Cryptococcus gattii VGII isolated from native forest and river in Northern Brazil
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - BackgroundCryptococcosis is a global invasive mycosis associated with significant morbidity and mortality. In the northern region of Brazil, this disease is caused by Cryptococcus neoformans genotype VNI and Cryptococcus gattii genotype VGII. However, few environmental studies have been conducted in this large tropical area.AimsThis study was performed to isolate, genotype, and determine the frequency of cryptococcal agents in environmental samples near Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil.MethodsA total of 970 environmental samples (290 from soil, 290 from decaying plants, 5 from insects, 280 from the Negro river, and 105 from small streams within the city of Manaus) were collected and plated on Niger seed agar. In addition, 20 sub-cultures obtained from each positive sample were analyzed by PCR-RFLP (URA5) and PCR for genotyping and determination of mating type.ResultsSix samples were positive for isolates from the C. gattii species complex. Of those, three samples were from Adolpho Ducke Forest Reserve and three were from the Negro river. All isolates were C. gattii genotype VGII (mating type MAT).ConclusionGenotype VGII proved to be the most important genotype found in the environmental samples. The genotype VGII has been described as one of the most virulent and less susceptible to antifungals and responsible for important outbreaks. This is the first study to demonstrate isolation of C. gattii (VGII) from the Negro river.

TI  - Signs of Urban Evolution? Morpho-Functional Traits Co-variation Along a Nature-Urban Gradient in a Chagas Disease Vector
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB  - Environmental change (i.e., urbanization) impacts species in contrasting ways, with some species experiencing benefits given their way of life (i.e., blood-sucking insects). How these species respond to such change is not well understood and for species involved in human diseases, this "how" question is particularly important. Most Triatominae bug species inhabit tropical and subtropical forests where their vertebrate hosts' temporal abundance depends on climate seasonality. However, in human encroached landscapes, triatomines can benefit from resource stability which may lead to adaptive phenotypic change to track novel hosts. We tested for an association between different landscapes and morpho-functional traits linked to sensory, motion, and feeding functions in Triatoma dimidiata and compared fecundity (i.e., number of eggs) in each landscape as a proxy of fitness. Using geometric and traditional morphometric tools, we predicted a morphological simplification in bugs inhabiting urbanized areas. While wing morphology or proboscis were not influenced by landscape class, the opposite occurred for thorax morphology and number of sensilla. Wing and thorax morphology did not covary under modified landscape scenarios, yet we detected a morpho-functional convergence for thorax size and antennal phenotype in both sexes, with a simplification trend, from nature to urban settings. Given no fecundity differences across landscapes, there is no potential reproductive costs. Moreover, the convergence of thorax size and antennal phenotype suggests differences in flight/locomotion performance and host/environment perception, as a possible adaptive response to relaxed selective pressures of the bug's native habitat. These results imply that T. dimidiata could be adapting to urbanized areas.

T2  - REVISTA DO INSTITUTO DE MEDICINA TROPICAL DE SAO PAULO
AB  - Rickettsia typhi is the causal agent of murine typhus; a worldwide zoonotic and vector-borne infectious disease, commonly associated with the presence of domestic and wild rodents. Human cases of murine typhus in the state of Yucatan are frequent. However, there is no evidence of the presence of Rickettsia typhi in mammals or vectors in Yucatan. The presence of Rickettsia in rodents and their ectoparasites was evaluated in a small municipality of Yucatan using the conventional polymerase chain reaction technique and sequencing. The study only identified the presence of Rickettsia typhi in blood samples obtained from Rattus rattus and it reported, for the first time, the presence of R. felis in the flea Polygenis odiosus collected from Ototylomys phyllotis rodent. Additionally, Rickettsia felis was detected in the ectoparasite Ctenocephalides felis fleas parasitizing the wild rodent Peromyscus yucatanicus. This study's results contributed to a better knowledge of Rickettsia epidemiology in Yucatan.

TI  - Environmental factors associated with the distribution of <i>Loa loa</i> vectors <i>Chrysops</i> spp. in Central and West Africa: seeing the forest for the trees
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
AB  - Loiasis is caused by the filarial parasite Loa loa, which is widespread through Central and West Africa and largely confined the tropical equatorial rainforests. The tabanid flies Chrysops silacea and Chrysops dimidiata are the main vectors driving transmission. This study aimed to better define the spatial distribution and ecological niche of the two vectors to help define spatial-temporal risk and target appropriate, timely intervention strategies for filariasis control and elimination programmes.
   Chrysops spp. distributions were determined by collating information from the published literature into a database, detailing the year, country, locality, latitude/longitude and species collected. Environmental factors including climate, elevation and tree canopy characteristics were summarised for each vector from data obtained from satellite modelled data or imagery, which were also used to identify areas with overt landcover changes. The presence of each Chrysops vector was predicted using a maximum entropy species distribution modelling (MaxEnt) method.
   A total of 313 location-specific data points from 59 published articles were identified across seven loiasis endemic countries. Of these, 186 sites were included in the climate and elevation analysis, and due to overt landcover changes, 83 sites included in tree canopy analysis and MaxEnt model. Overall, C. silacea and C. dimidiata were found to have similar ranges; annual mean temperature (24.6 A degrees C and 24.1 A degrees C, respectively), annual precipitation (1848.6 mm and 1868.8 mm), elevation (368.8 m and 400.6 m), tree canopy cover (61.4% and 66.9%) and tree canopy height (22.4 m and 25.1 m). MaxEnt models found tree canopy coverage was a significant environmental variable for both vectors.
   The Chrysops spp. database and large-scale environmental analysis provides insights into the spatial and ecological parameters of the L. loa vectors driving transmission. These may be used to further delineate loiasis risk, which will be important for implementing filariasis control and elimination programmes in the equatorial rainforest region of Central and West Africa.

TI  - Biocultural nationalism? Bananas and biosecurity in Northern Queensland
T2  - AUSTRALIAN GEOGRAPHER
AB  - The Cavendish banana is Australia's most popular fruit and marketed as emblematic of Australian nationalisms. In July 2017, the disease-causing fungus Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense was confirmed present on Australia's largest Cavendish banana farm, in the worst disease incursion that Northern Queensland Cavendish monocrop plantations have yet faced. Confronted with the potential collapse of the industry, banana growers and Biosecurity Queensland officials have deployed a biosecurity response centred on measures of border control and containment. This paper examines the othering of the disease vector Panama Tropical Race 4, revealing biosecurity attempts as embroiled in cultural preoccupations with invasion. In so doing, this paper establishes that the biosecurity concerns regarding Northern Queensland bananas are not just with the economic and biological productivity of nature, but entangled in post-colonial anxieties over who belongs within the landscape. Following the entangled relations between the disease and Cavendish bananas reveals cultural nuances and multispecies relations. These shape and are shaped by industry and government efforts as experts attempt to maintain governance over entities as they appear to slip from human control. This paper finds that the anxieties and narratives of Australian post-colonial politics are deeply imbricated with the logics of ecological protection, agricultural productivity and the banality of everyday nationalisms.

TI  - Antagonistic activity and chitinolytic potential of endophytic fungi recovered from cacti growing in the Brazilian tropical dry forest
T2  - SYDOWIA
AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the antagonistic activity and chitinolytic potential of 20 species of fungal endophytes isolated from Cactaceae species and deposited at the URM culture collection in Brazil against nine strains of phytopathogenic fungi isolated from the forage cactus Nopalea cochenillifera. Phytopathogenic fungi were obtained from diseased tissues of N. cochenillifera and identified through analyses of morphology and DNA sequences of different genes (ITS rDNA, RPB2, and TEF1). The antagonistic potentials of these endophytes were analysed in terms of inhibition, parasitism and competition, and the enzyme activity by assay in submerged fermentation using colloidal chitin as a carbon source. Nine phytopathogenic fungi were isolated and identified as belonging to Alternaria, Curvularia, Fusarium, Neoscytalidium, and Neurospora. Antagonism by inhibition was the most significant category, with 17 endophytic species having inhibitory potential. Aspergillus tamarii URM 7505 and Penicillium griseofulvum URM 6846 inhibited all tested pathogenic fungi. Although all 20 endophytic fungal species effectively produced chitinase (0.20-5.36 U/ml), the highest production level was observed for Aspergillus parasiticus URM 6868 (5.36 U/ml).

TI  - Tree model based eco-climatic vegetation classification and fuzzy mapping in diverse tropical deciduous ecosystems using multi-season NDVI
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Many vegetation classification strategies in tropical ecosystems involving conventional image processing of original satellite imagery bands require considerable prior site knowledge, statistical assumptions, and are difficult, expensive and inconsistent. In this paper we show that the intra-annual variation and rates of change in NDVI for different parts of a large forest area in combination with rules derived from a tree model can be used for detailed vegetation mapping. We used three-date NDVI data for the Biligiri Rangaswamy Temple Wildlife Sanctuary in Karnataka, southern India comprising mean NDVI, coefficient of variation (CV) and two NDVI change vectors corresponding to intraseasonal NDVI differences. A rule-based classification using a tree model was developed at two levels. The overall kappa statistic is 0.61 at level 1 classification, indicating a strong correspondence with the raster version of the available vector reference map based on ground data, even though the two maps are not strictly comparable. Several limitations of the available reference map have been highlighted by the new technique, especially the absence of ecotones. At level two the tree model map has provided detailed classification of dry deciduous forests and new classes not available in the reference map. The method in combination with reference data also provides a framework for fuzzy classification. This technique offers a relatively simple cost-effective alternative to existing classification strategies, especially for areas with diverse evergreen and deciduous vegetation elements.

TI  - Opportunities and limitations of thinning to increase resistance and resilience of trees and forests to global change
T2  - FORESTRY
AB  - We reviewed recent literature to identify the positive and negative effects of thinning on both stand- and tree-level resistance and resilience to four stressors that are expected to increase in frequency and/or severity due to global change: (1) drought, (2) fire, (3) insects and pathogens, and (4) wind. There is strong evidence that thinning, particularly heavy thinning, reduces the impact of drought and also the risk and severity of fire when harvest slash is burned or removed. Thinning also increases the growth and vigor of residual trees, making them less susceptible to eruptive insects and pathogens, while targeted removal of host species, susceptible individuals and infected trees can slow the spread of outbreaks. However, the evidence that thinning has consistent positive effects is limited to a few insects and pathogens, and negative effects on root rot infection severity were also reported. At this point, our review reveals insufficient evidence from rigorous experiments to draw general conclusions. Although thinning initially increases the risk of windthrow, there is good evidence that thinning young stands reduces the long-term risk by promoting the development of structural roots and favouring the acclimation of trees to high wind loads. While our review suggests that thinning should not be promoted as a tool that will universally increase the resistance and resilience of forests, current evidence suggests that thinning could still be an effective tool to reduce forest vulnerability to several stressors, creating a window of opportunity to implement longer term adaptive management strategies such as assisted migration. We highlight knowledge gaps that should be targeted by future research to assess the potential contribution of thinning to adaptive forest management. One of these gaps is that studies from boreal and tropical regions are drastically underrepresented, with almost no studies conducted in Asia and the southern hemisphere. Empirical evidence from these regions is urgently needed to allow broader-scale conclusions.

TI  - Epidemiology of malaria in the forest-savanna transitional zone of Ghana
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
AB  - Background: Information on the epidemiology of malaria is essential for designing and interpreting results of clinical trials of drugs, vaccines and other interventions. As a background to the establishment of a site for anti-malarial drugs and vaccine trials, the epidemiology of malaria in a rural site in central Ghana was investigated.
   Methods: Active surveillance of clinical malaria was carried out in a cohort of children below five years of age (n = 335) and the prevalence of malaria was estimated in a cohort of subjects of all ages (n = 1484) over a 12-month period. Participants were sampled from clusters drawn around sixteen index houses randomly selected from a total of about 22,000 houses within the study area. The child cohort was visited thrice weekly to screen for any illness and a blood slide was taken if a child had a history of fever or a temperature greater than or equal to 37.5 degree Celsius. The all-age cohort was screened for malaria once every eight weeks over a 12-month period. Estimation of Entomological Inoculation Rate (EIR) and characterization of Anopheline malaria vectors in the study area were also carried out.
   Results: The average parasite prevalence in the all age cohort was 58% (95% CI: 56.9, 59.4). In children below five years of age, the average prevalence was 64% (95% CI: 61.9, 66.0). Geometric mean parasite densities decreased significantly with increasing age. More than 50% of all children less than 10 years of age were anaemic. Children less than 5 years of age had as many as seven malaria attacks per child per year. The attack rates decreased significantly with increasing cut-offs of parasite density. The average Multiplicity of Infection (MOI) was of 6.1. All three pyrimethamine resistance mutant alleles of the Plasmodium falciparum dhfr gene were prevalent in this population and 25% of infections had a fourth mutant of pfdhps-A437G. The main vectors were Anopheles funestus and Anopheles gambiae and the EIR was 269 infective bites per person per year.
   Conclusion: The transmission of malaria in the forest-savanna region of central Ghana is high and perennial and this is an appropriate site for conducting clinical trials of anti-malarial drugs and vaccines.

AB  - Knowledge about parent material (PM) is crucial to understand the properties of overlying soils. Assessing PM of very deep soils, however, is not easy. Previous studies have predicted PM via proximal sensors and machine learning algorithms, but within small areas and with low soil variety. This study evaluates the efficiency of using portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) spectrometry together with machine learning algorithms in a large area populated with a wide variety of soil classes and land uses to build accurate PM distribution maps from soil data. Samples from A and B horizons were collected from 117 sites, totaling 234 samples, along with representative PM samples of the predominant PMs in the region. Elemental contents of PM and soil samples were obtained using pXRF. Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) models built with and without Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were used to predict PMs from A and B horizon samples separately. For validation, PM was identified in 23 different spots and compared with the predicted PM via overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient. Maps built with models excluding PCA had an overall accuracy ranging from 0.87 to 0.96 and kappa coefficient ranging from 0.74 to 0.91. Maps generated with PCA based models reached 100% overall accuracy. Prediction of PM using pXRF with samples from either A or B horizon and machine learning algorithms offers solid results even when applied in large areas with high land use and soil class variability.

TI  - <i>Fusarium</i> spp. diversity associated with symptomatic <i>Acacia koa</i> in Hawai'i
T2  - FOREST PATHOLOGY
AB  - Fusarium spp. comprise diverse plant pathogens, which affect both agriculturally and ecologically important plant species, and harmless saprobes. Fusarium spp. inhabit widely ranging, geographic regions across the globe and can be found in soil or plant tissue in every climate type, ranging from tropical to polar regions. In their native habitats, Fusarium spp. are typically innocuous and ubiquitous soil saprophytes; however, Fusarium spp. can become devastating pathogens, especially after introduction into novel environments, where hosts are not adapted to Fusarium infection. Hawai'i is among the most isolated regions on Earth. Due to this isolation, many of Hawai'i's native plant species are not well adapted to cope with introductions of novel flora, fauna and pathogens. Pathogens, including Fusarium spp., have had a major impact on Acacia koa (koa), an iconic tree species in Hawai'i's forests. Multiple Fusarium spp. have been identified in association with koa, some of which have been screened for pathogenicity to koa. This study identified new associations of Fusarium spp. with koa root samples including F. verticillioides, F. redolens, F. anthophilum, F. babinda, F. commune, F. fujikuroi and F. lactis and suggests that a complex of Fusarium spp. may contribute to disease severity. Potential spread of putative pathogens across the Hawaiian Islands is suggested on the basis of haplotype network analysis.

TI  - Investigating the spatial micro-epidemiology of diseases within a point-prevalence sample: a field applicable method for rapid mapping of households using low-cost GPS-dataloggers
T2  - TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Point-prevalence recording of the distribution of tropical parasitic diseases at village level is usually sufficient for general monitoring and surveillance. Whilst within-village spatial patterning of diseases exists, and can be important, mapping infected cases in a household-by-household setting is arduous and time consuming. With the development of low-cost GPS-data loggers (< (sic)40) and available GoogleEarth (TM) satellite imagery, we present a field-applicable method based on crowdsourcing for rapid identification of infected cases (intestinal schistosomiasis, malaria and hookworm) by household. A total of 126 mothers with their 247 preschool children from Bukoba village (Mayuge District, Uganda) were examined with half of these mothers given a GPS-data logger to walk home with, returning the unit the same day for data off-loading, after which, households were assigned GPS coordinates. A satellite image of Bukoba was annotated with households denoting the infection status of each mother and child. General prevalence of intestinal schistosomiasis, malaria and hookworm in mothers and children was: 27.2 vs 7.7%, 28.6 vs 87.0% and 60.0 vs 22.3%, respectively. Different spatial patterns of disease could be identified likely representing the intrinsic differences in parasite biology and interplay with human behaviour(s) across this local landscape providing a better insight into reasons for disease micro-patterning.

TI  - Mapping of Ebola virus spillover: Suitability and seasonal variability at the landscape scale
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Author summary Ebola virus disease is a highly pathogenic disease transmitted from wildlife to humans. It was first described in 1976 and its distribution remained restricted to Central Africa until 2014, when an outbreak in West Africa, causing more than 28,000 cases and more than 11,000 deaths, took place. Anthropogenic factors, such as bushmeat hunting, trade and consumption, and environmental and climatic factors, may promote the contact between humans and infected animals, such as bats, primates and duikers, increasing the risk of virus transmission to the human population. In this study, we used the spatial multicriteria evaluation framework to gather all available information on risk factors and animal species susceptible to infection, and produce maps of areas suitable for Ebola virus spillover in regions in Guinea, Congo and Gabon. The resulting maps highlighted high spatial and temporal variability in the suitability for Ebola virus spillover. Data from reported cases of Ebola virus transmission from wild animals to humans were used to validate the maps. The approach developed is capable of integrating a wide diversity of risk factors, and provides a flexible and simple tool for surveillance, which can be updated as more data and knowledge on risk factors become available.
   The unexpected Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa in 2014 involving the Zaire ebolavirus made clear that other regions outside Central Africa, its previously documented niche, were at risk of future epidemics. The complex transmission cycle and a lack of epidemiological data make mapping areas at risk of the disease challenging. We used a Geographic Information System-based multicriteria evaluation (GIS-MCE), a knowledge-based approach, to identify areas suitable for Ebola virus spillover to humans in regions of Guinea, Congo and Gabon where Ebola viruses already emerged. We identified environmental, climatic and anthropogenic risk factors and potential hosts from a literature review. Geographical data layers, representing risk factors, were combined to produce suitability maps of Ebola virus spillover at the landscape scale. Our maps show high spatial and temporal variability in the suitability for Ebola virus spillover at a fine regional scale. Reported spillover events fell in areas of intermediate to high suitability in our maps, and a sensitivity analysis showed that the maps produced were robust. There are still important gaps in our knowledge about what factors are associated with the risk of Ebola virus spillover. As more information becomes available, maps produced using the GIS-MCE approach can be easily updated to improve surveillance and the prevention of future outbreaks.

TI  - Antibacterial and antioxidant potential of GC-MS analysis of crude ethyl acetate extract from the tropical mangrove plant <i>Avicennia</i> <i>officinalis</i> L.
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
AB  - Avicennia officinalis L. is an important mangrove plant used in traditional medicine to treat various diseases like asthma, dyspepsia, paralysis, tumor and rheumatism in aboriginal peoples in Andaman and Nicobar Islands (ANI). The study analyzed and separated bioactive speciation of ethyl acetate leaves extract of A. officinalis from tropical mangrove plants by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GCMS) and further antimicrobial and antioxidant potential assay. GC-MS results of A. officinalis identified eight different bioactive compounds namely Trans-cinnamic acid, 2,4-Di-tert-butyl phenol, Phenol, 3-(2phenylethyl, n-hexadecanoic acid, Dibutyl phthalate, Phytol, beta-Sitosterol, Androst-7-ene-6, 17-dione and 2,3,14-trihydroxy. The natural products present in A. officinalis showed strong antibacterial activity against different bacteria like gram-positive strain: Streptococcus mutans (19 mm maximum zone of inhibition), Bacillus subtilis (17 mm), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (16 mm), and gram-negative: Klebsiella pneumonia (22 mm) and Enterobacter aerohenes (14 mm). Further, this crude extract showed good antioxidant activity with IC50 values of 23.60 +/- 0.43 mu g/ml measured using the DPPH method. Thus, the study put forth the promising role of ethyl acetate leaves extract of A. officinalis in the formulation of therapeutic drugs against bacterial infections, antioxidants and cancer.

TI  - Arbovirus expansion: New species of culicids infected by the Chikungunya virus in an urban park of Brazil
T2  - ACTA TROPICA
AB  - The Dengue, Zika and Chikungunya viruses have been spreading in tropical regions, causing epidemics with high morbidity rates and fatal cases. The aim of this study was to assess the diversity and abundance of culicid species and the presence of arboviruses in mosquitoes, at the epicenter of an epidemic outbreak that occurred in people living near an urban Atlantic Forest park. Mosquitoes were captured with a Shannon trap between 2 and 6 pm in seven months of 2019. The Chikungunya virus was investigated according to the protocol described by Lanciotti (2007). The most abundant species were Wyeomyia bourrouli (66.9%) and Aedes albopictus (23.9%). Also captured were Aedes fluviatilis (3.2%); Haemagogus leucocelaenus (2.2%); Aedes scapularis (2.2%); Aedes aegypti (1.6%); Aedes serratus and (0.3%) and Aedes taeniorhynchus (0.3%). The Chikungunya virus was identified in A. aegypti females; A. albopictus females and males; Aedes fluviatilis and Wy.bourrouli. The presence of the Chikungunya virus in the afore mentioned mosquitoes reinforces the hypothesis that arbovirus expansion is associated with the participation of other mosquito species in the transmission areas, primarily the Chikungunya virus in the study area. The data also demonstrate the need for permanent entomological surveillance and measures to preserve the area, in order to hinder its degradation, the adaptation of culicid species to new habitats and the formation of enzootic cycles of these viruses in the forest.

TI  - The Schistosomiasis Clinical Trials Landscape: A Systematic Review of Antischistosomal Treatment Efficacy Studies and a Case for Sharing Individual Participant-Level Data (IPD)
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   Schistosomiasis control mainly relies on preventive chemotherapy with praziquantel (PZQ) distributed through mass drug administration. With a target of 260 million treatments yearly, reliably assessing and monitoring efficacy is all-important. Recommendations for treatment and control of schistosomiasis are supported by systematic reviews and meta-analyses of aggregated data, which however also point to limitations due to heterogeneity in trial design, analyses and reporting. Some such limitations could be corrected through access to individual participant-level data (IPD), which facilitates standardised analyses.
   Methodology
   A systematic literature review was conducted to identify antischistosomal drug efficacy studies performed since 2000; including electronic searches of the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group specialised register and the Cochrane Library, PubMed, CENTRAL and Embase; complemented with a manual search for articles listed in past reviews. Antischistosomal treatment studies with assessment of outcome within 60 days post-treatment were eligible. Meta-data, i.e. study-level characteristics (Schistosoma species, number of patients, drug administered, country, etc.) and efficacy parameters were extracted from published documents to evaluate the scope of an individual-level data sharing platform.
   Principal findings
   Out of 914 documents screened, 90 studies from 26 countries were included, enrolling 20,517 participants infected with Schistosoma spp. and treated with different PZQ regimens or other drugs. Methodologies varied in terms of diagnostic approaches (number of samples and test repeats), time of outcome assessment, and outcome measure (cure rate or egg reduction rate, as an arithmetic or geometric mean), making direct comparison of published data difficult.
   Conclusions
   This review describes the landscape of schistosomiasis clinical research. The volume of data and the methodological and reporting heterogeneity identified all indicate that there is scope for an individual participant-level database, to allow for standardised analyses.

TI  - Effect of land-use changes on the abundance, distribution, and host-seeking behavior of <i>Aedes</i> arbovirus vectors in oil palm-dominated landscapes, southeastern Cote d'Ivoire
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Background
   Identifying priority areas for vector control is of considerable public health relevance. Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) spread by Aedes mosquitoes are (re) emerging in many parts of the tropics, partially explained by changes in agricultural land-use. We explored the effects of land-use changes on the abundance, distribution, and host-seeking behavior of Aedes mosquitoes along a gradient of anthropogenic disturbance in oil palm-dominated landscapes in southeastern Cote d'Ivoire.
   Methodology
   Between January and December 2014, eggs, larvae, pupae, and adults of Aedes mosquitoes were sampled in four types of macrohabitats (rainforest, polyculture, oil palm monoculture, and rural housing areas), using standard procedures (bamboo-ovitraps, metallicovitraps, larval surveys, and human-baited double-net traps). Immature stages were reared and adult mosquitoes identified at species level.
   Principal findings
   A total of 28,276 Aedes specimens belonging to 11 species were collected. No Aedes-positive microhabitat and only four specimens of Ae. aegypti were found in oil palm monoculture. The highest abundance of Aedes mosquitoes (60.9%) was found in polyculture, while the highest species richness (11 species) was observed in rainforest. Ae. aegypti was the predominant Aedes species, and exhibited high anthropophilic behavior inflicting 93.0% of total biting to humans. The biting rate of Aedes mosquitoes was 34.6 and 7.2-fold higher in polyculture and rural housing areas, respectively, compared to rainforest. Three species (Ae. aegypti, Ae. dendrophilus, and Ae. vittatus) bit humans in polyculture and rural housing areas, with respective biting rates of 21.48 and 4.48 females/person/day. Unexpectedly, all three species were also feeding during darkness. Aedes females showed bimodal daily feeding cycles with peaks at around 08: 00 a. m. and 05: 00 p. m. Host-seeking activities were interrupted between 11: 00 a. m. and 02: 00 p. m. in rural housing areas, while no such interruption was observed in polyculture. Some rainforest-dwelling Aedes species displayed little preference to feed on humans.
   Conclusions
   In southeastern Co A te d'Ivoire, the agricultural land-use/land-cover changes due to the conversion of rainforest into oil palm monocultures influence the abundance, distribution, and host-seeking behaviors of anthropophagic and non-anthropophagic Aedes vectors. As a result, there is higher risk of humans to arbovirus transmission in polyculture and rural housing areas. There is a need for integrated vector management, including landscape epidemiology and ecotope-based vector control.

TI  - Epidemic preparedness: why is there a need to accelerate the development of diagnostics?
T2  - LANCET INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB  - Global epidemics of infectious diseases are increasing in frequency and severity. Diagnostics are needed for rapid identification of the cause of the epidemic to facilitate effective control and prevention. Lessons learned from the recent Ebola virus and Zika virus epidemics are that delay in developing the right diagnostic for the right population at the right time has been a costly barrier to disease control and prevention. We believe that it is possible to accelerate and optimise diagnostic development through a five-pronged strategy: by doing a global landscape analysis of diagnostic availability worldwide; through strategic partnerships for accelerating test development, in particular with vaccine companies to identify novel diagnostic targets; by creating and sharing repositories of data, reagents, and well characterised specimens for advancing the development process; by involving key public and private stakeholders, including appropriate regulatory bodies and policy makers, to ensure rapid access for researchers to diagnostics; and last, by fostering an enabling environment for research and access to diagnostics in the countries that need them. The need is great, but not insurmountable and innovative and faster development pathways are urgently required to address current shortfalls.

TI  - Comparing six pixel-wise classifiers for tropical rural land cover mapping using four forms of fully polarimetric SAR data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
AB  - This study evaluates four commonly used forms of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data for land-cover classification in tropical rural areas. The backscatter coefficient of linearly polarized L-band SAR was compared to two distinctive feature sets derived from Eigen-based and model-based decompositions. The performance of six classifiers available in Orfeo Toolbox (OTB), that is, Bayes, artificial neural networks (ANNs), Support Vector Machine (SVM), decision trees, Random Forests (RFs), and gradient boosting trees (GBTs), was investigated to distinguish five and seven land-cover classes, with particular attention given to several types of woody vegetation: forest, mixed garden, rubber, oil palm, and tea plantations. Classifiers reacted differently to ingested forms of SAR data, and careless use of data input yielded a negative impact. The results showed that SVM provided the highest overall accuracy although the performance was not significantly better than the others. Tuning the parameters, however, significantly improved the accuracy of ANN and SVM, while RF and GBT did not respond well. Responses of two SVM parameters (cost and kernel type) fluctuated somewhat, which required further attention. ANN accuracy was improved when the number of neurons in the hidden layer was set between 10 and 12. We found that accuracy imbalance existed between designated land-cover classes, especially in woody vegetation. Imbalance can partially be reduced by tuning specific classifiers. We showed that classifier tuning can lead to significantly improved accuracy, especially for classes having medium or low accuracies. This research also demonstrated that freely available toolkits such as OTB and QGIS can be beneficial for mapping activities in developing countries, achieving a reasonable accuracy if the classification parameters are tuned properly.

TI  - Spatial elements of mortality risk in old-growth forests
T2  - ECOLOGY
AB  - For many species of long-lived organisms, such as trees, survival appears to be the most critical vital rate affecting population persistence. However, methods commonly used to quantify tree death, such as relating tree mortality risk solely to diameter growth, almost certainly do not account for important spatial processes. Our goal in this study was to detect and, if present, to quantify the relevance of such processes. For this purpose, we examined purely spatial aspects of mortality for four species, Abies concolor, Abies magnifica, Calocedrus decurrens, and Pinus lambertiana, in an old-growth conifer forest in the Sierra Nevada of California, USA. The analysis was performed using data from nine fully mapped long-term monitoring plots.
   In three cases, the results unequivocally supported the inclusion of spatial information in models used to predict mortality. For Abies concolor, our results suggested that growth rate may not always adequately capture increased mortality risk due to competition. We also found evidence of a facilitative effect for this species, with mortality risk decreasing with proximity to conspecific neighbors. For Pinus lambertiana, mortality risk increased with density of conspecific neighbors, in keeping with a mechanism of increased pathogen or insect pressure ( i.e., a Janzen-Connell type effect). Finally, we found that models estimating risk of being crushed were strongly improved by the inclusion of a simple index of spatial proximity.
   Not only did spatial indices improve models, those improvements were relevant for mortality prediction. For P. lambertiana, spatial factors were important for estimation of mortality risk regardless of growth rate. For A. concolor, although most of the population fell within spatial conditions in which mortality risk was well described by growth, trees that died occurred outside those conditions in a disproportionate fashion. Furthermore, as stands of A. concolor become increasingly dense, such spatial factors are likely to become increasingly important. In general, models that fail to account for spatial pattern are at risk of failure as conditions change.

TI  - Insights into Antibody-Mediated Alphavirus Immunity and Vaccine Development Landscape
T2  - MICROORGANISMS
AB  - Alphaviruses are mosquito-borne pathogens distributed worldwide in tropical and temperate areas causing a wide range of symptoms ranging from inflammatory arthritis-like manifestations to the induction of encephalitis in humans. Historically, large outbreaks in susceptible populations have been recorded followed by the development of protective long-lasting antibody responses suggesting a potential advantageous role for a vaccine. Although the current understanding of alphavirus antibody-mediated immunity has been mainly gathered in natural and experimental settings of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection, little is known about the humoral responses triggered by other emerging alphaviruses. This knowledge is needed to improve serology-based diagnostic tests and the development of highly effective cross-protective vaccines. Here, we review the role of antibody-mediated immunity upon arthritogenic and neurotropic alphavirus infections, and the current research efforts for the development of vaccines as a tool to control future alphavirus outbreaks.

TI  - LEARNING TO LOVE THE WORLD'S MOST HATED CROP
T2  - JOURNAL OF OIL PALM RESEARCH
AB  - The 2019 Inter-governmental Panel (IPCC) Report on Climate Change and Land highlighted the urgency and scale of the environmental impact from human-induced landscape change. Palm oil has historically had a particularly negative reputation for driving deforestation, biodiversity loss, greenhouse gas emissions, social exploitation and damaging health. In the eyes of many in the West, it is regarded as the world's most hated crop. However, palm is highly productive compared with other crops and produces 40% of the worlds edible oil from only 5% of vegetable oil producing land and 0.4% of agricultural land in total. It has the potential to meet future demand for oil with minimum additional environmental and climate impact compared with other sources of vegetable oil. The related high value density has the potential to move millions of vulnerable smallholder farmers out of poverty. Given the conclusions of the IPCC Climate and Land Report, it is therefore important to re-examine the crop's reputation in light of the accumulated evidence and to properly understand the full impacts across the environmental, health, social and economic factors. We present a comprehensive review of the benefits and risks of the crop across these dimensions and provide a new synthesis. We conclude that while oil palm has had a significant negative impact on habitat and biodiversity, it plays a minor role compared with poaching, illegal logging and threats from climate change. There are important opportunities for the industry to reverse this damage. Its reputation for negative health impacts are not backed up by the scientific evidence and indeed there may be health benefits from substituting some oils in the diet with oil palm. Positive social and economic impacts are most obvious in areas where proper market-led economies are in place, but there can be significant negative social impacts in less developed areas. We conclude that much of the reputation of palm oil is not based on a balanced interpretation of the scientific evidence. Provided future development is zero deforestation, does not occur on peat, uses methane capture technology at the mills, empowers indigenous smallholders and supports the regeneration of secondary forest, we conclude that oil palm can be the most environmentally, socially and economically sustainable means to meet future demand for vegetable oil. Indeed, with pro-active collaboration with relevant non-government organisations, oil palm can be part of the solution to reversing the degradation of tropical forest biomes.

TI  - Comparison of Conventional Change Detection Methodologies Using High-Resolution Imagery to Find Forest Damage Caused by Typhoons
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - The number of intense tropical cyclones is expected to increase in the future, causing severe damage to forest ecosystems. Remote sensing plays an important role in detecting changes in land cover caused by these tropical storms. Remote sensing techniques have been widely used in different phases of disaster risk management because they can deliver information rapidly to the concerned parties. Although remote sensing technology is already available, an examination of appropriate methods based on the type of disaster is still missing. Our goal is to compare the suitability of three different conventional classification methods for fast and easy change detection analysis using high-spatial-resolution and high-temporal-resolution remote sensing imagery to identify areas with windthrow and landslides caused by typhoons. In August 2016, four typhoons hit Hokkaido, the northern island of Japan, creating large areas of windthrow and landslides. We compared the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) filtering method, the spectral angle mapper (SAM) method, and the support vector machine (SVM) method to identify windthrow and landslides in two different study areas in southwestern Hokkaido. These methodologies were evaluated using PlanetScope data with a resolution of 3 m/px and validated with reference data based on Worldview2 data with a very high resolution of 0.46 m/px. The results showed that all three methods, when applied to high-spatial-resolution imagery, can deliver sufficient results for windthrow and landslide detection. In particular, the SAM method performed better at windthrow detection, and the NDVI filtering method performed better at landslide detection.

TI  - Comparison of the Hazards Posed to Amphibians by the Glyphosate Spray Control Program Versus the Chemical and Physical Activities of Coca Production in Colombia
T2  - JOURNAL OF TOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH-PART A-CURRENT ISSUES
AB  - This study evaluates the cumulative multifactorial physical and chemical impacts resulting from coca production on amphibian populations in comparison with the potential impacts produced by the herbicide glyphosate (Glyphos), which, mixed with the surfactant Cosmo-Flux, is used in the spray control program for illicit crops in Colombia. Using similar worst-case assumptions for exposure, several other pesticides used for coca production, including mancozeb, lambda cyhalothrin, endosulfan, diazinon, malathion, and chlorpyrifos, were up to 10- to 100-fold more toxic to frogs than the Glyphos-Cosmo-Flux mixture. Comparing hazard quotients based on application rates, several of these compounds demonstrated hazards 3-383 times that of formulated glyphosate. Secondary effects, particularly of insecticides, are also a concern, as these agents selectively target the primary food source of amphibians, which may indirectly impact growth and development. Although the potential chemical impacts by other pesticides are considerable, physical activities associated with coca production, particularly deforestation of primary forests for new coca plots, portend the greatest hazard to amphibian populations. The entire production cycle of cocaine has been linked to ecosystem degradation. The clearing of pristine forests for coca propagation in Colombia is well documented, and some of these regions coincide with those that contain exceptional amphibian biodiversity. This is particularly problematic as coca production encroaches more deeply into more remote areas of tropical rain forest. Transportation of disease, including the chitrid fungus, to these remote regions via human intrusion may also adversely affect amphibian populations. Therefore, the cumulative impacts of coca production, through habitat destruction, application of agrochemicals, and potential transmission of disease, are judged to pose greater risks to amphibian populations in coca-growing regions than the glyphosate spray control program.

TI  - Vaccinating the traveler.
T2  - ANNALES DE MEDECINE INTERNE
AB  - Travelers' immunization has 2 aims: for the traveler, to prevent the risk of contracting an endemic disease during his stay abroad; for the community to prevent the risk of importing an infectious agent yet unknown in the country. Travelling offers an opportunity to update routine immunizations: tetanus, diphtheria, poliomyelitis, hepatitis B; for young people: measles and rubella; for elderly people: influenza. Two vaccinations are compulsory: yellow fever for travelers to tropical Africa and Amazonian forest; meningococcus A + C for Mecca pilgrims. Other vaccines are recommended for travelers to specific areas: typhoid fever, hepatitis A, cholera in countries with poor hygiene; rabies for exposed travelers (expatriates, trekkers...); Japanese encephalitis for persons spending a month or longer in rural agricultural areas during the monsoon season; tickborne encephalitis for persons visiting forested areas of central Europe from may to september.
   Yet, most of travelers' diseases such as malaria cannot be prevented by vaccination and appropriate preventive measures (chemoprophylaxis and protection against insects) should be taken.

TI  - Separating effects of species identity and species richness on predation, pathogen dissemination and resistance to invasive species in tropical ant communities
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - 1 Ants are abundant in natural and managed tropical ecosystems and can have an impact on herbivorous arthropods, as well as plant pathogens. Although it has been shown for plants that the diversity of communities can result in improved ecosystem functioning, it remains uncertain how the species richness of ants affects multiple ecosystem services and disservices.
   2 In the present study, we used experimentally enhanced natural gradients in ant species richness on 100 cacao trees in a plantation aiming to analyze the effect of ant species identity and species richness on predation pressure and the incidence of cacao pod borer (CPB), as well as the spread of black pod disease (BPD).
   3 Ant species richness did not significantly improve predation of experimentally exposed insects, and was not associated with a reduction in the incidence of CPB. However, the incidence of BPD was higher in ant species rich trees, presumably because more ant species were pathogen vectors. The identity of the dominant ant species affected the incidence of CPB and BPD, as well as predation pressure.
   4 Although both ant species richness and identity affected ecosystem services and disservices delivered by the ant community, the results of the present study suggest that the identity of dominant ants is the main driver for ecosystem services in these systems.

TI  - Diversity and seasonality of tropical Pselaphidae and Anthicidae (Coleoptera)
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE KONINKLIJKE NEDERLANDSE AKADEMIE VAN WETENSCHAPPEN
AB  - Diversity and seasonal abundance patterns in anthicid and pselaphid beetles were studied at six sites in the Republic of Panama by means of light-traps. Pselaphids were much richer in species than anthicids, and the latter were rare or absent at higher elevations. Many more species of pselaphids were found in these tropical samples than in any temperate zone samples known to us. Between-site similarities in species composition were generally low, much lower than between-year within-site similarities, but were highly correlated with such similarities calculated for other groups of insects from these same sites. Seasonal variation in abundance was characterized using circular statistics. The degree of seasonality, measured by the 'Mean Vector', was higher at the seasonal than at the less seasonal sites, but much lower than at most temperate zone sites. At two of the three sites where anthicids were relatively common, they had the mean of their seasonal distribution mainly at the late dry season and early rainy season, while the means of the pselaphids were found throughout the rainy season. At the third site, an aseasonal one, means of abundance of species of both families were found throughout the year. At two sites, but not at the other sites, many species had a distinct bimodal distribution. The between-site variation in seasonality was of the same order of magnitude as the within-site between-year variation.

TI  - Fluctuations in daily energy intake do not cause physiological stress in a Neotropical primate living in a seasonal forest
T2  - OECOLOGIA
AB  - Animals may face periods of nutritional stress due to short-term food shortage and/or low energy consumption associated with seasonal fluctuations in resource availability. We tested the hypothesis that periods of restricted macronutrient and energy intake result in energy deficits and physiological stress in wild black howler monkeys (Alouatta pigra) inhabiting seasonal tropical semi-deciduous forests. We conducted full-day follows of focal animals recording feeding rates, time spent feeding, and total amount of food ingested. We carried out nutritional analysis of foods collected from feeding trees and calculated the daily nutrient and energy intake of each focal individual. Fecal glucocorticoid metabolites (fGCM) of focal animals were used as an indicator of physiological stress. We found that fluctuations in daily energy intake across seasons did not have significant effects on fGCM of individuals. However, protein intake was negatively associated with fGCM, highlighting the interplay among macronutrients, metabolism, and the endocrine system. Fecal glucocorticoid metabolites were also positively related to fruit availability, but this relationship was most likely due to social stress associated with intergroup encounters and resource defense that occurred when preferred trees were fruiting. Behavioral strategies such as dietary shifts and nutrient mixing, and metabolic adaptations such as low energy expenditure allowed individuals to fulfill their minimum energy requirements even during periods of decreased resource availability and intake. The present study suggests that seasonal variations in food, macronutrient, and energy acquisition may have limited physiological costs for animals that exploit different types of plant resources such as howler monkeys.

TI  - Current status of leptospirosis in Japan and Philippines
T2  - COMPARATIVE IMMUNOLOGY MICROBIOLOGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB  - Leptospirosis is an acute febrile illness with a wide variety of clinical manifestations and is encountered throughout the world, prominently in tropical areas with high rainfall. In this paper, we review the current status of leptospirosis in two Asian countries, Japan and Philippines, which have quite different situations in terms of economy, environment, infrastructures and prevailing infectious diseases. In Japan, until 1960, more than 200 deaths due to leptospirosis had been reported yearly. After 1960, the number of reported cases had rapidly decreased. Now, leptospirosis cases notified every year were less than 20. After the early 1960s, modernization of agriculture was introduced, at the same time, inactivated vaccine against Leptospira was applied for humans and there was good maintenance of infrastructures such as water works and sewage systems. In Philippines, on the other hand, leptospirosis patients tend to be frequently found in flood-prone areas of urban setting such as Metro Manila, which was found to be the endemic foci of leptospirosis. Morbidity in a rural area (Cabatuan, Iloilo) was 147 cases per 100,000 populations. From 1998 to 2001, about 70% of 1200 suspected leptospirosis patients in Philippines were serologically positive. The average age of patients was 32 years old where 87% of the cases were males and 70% were outdoor workers. Case fatality rate was found to be 12-14%. The estimated major serovars in Metro Manila and neighboring provinces were Manilae, Losbanos, Tarassovi, Poi and an unknown serovar. Outbreaks of leptospirosis in the Philippines are thought to be associated with heavy rainfall, rapid urbanization (dramatic increase in populations), deforestation, increasing number of flood-prone areas, poor infrastructures and many others.

TI  - Genetic variability highlights the invasion route of the <i>Lutzomyia longipalpis</i> complex, the main vector of Visceral Leishmaniasis in Uruguay
T2  - ZOONOSES AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - In the Americas, the sandfly Lutzomyia longipalpis is the main vector of the parasitic protozoa Leishmania infantum, the etiological agent of visceral leishmaniasis (VL). The Lu. longipalpis species complex is currently discontinuously distributed across the Neotropical region, from Mexico to the north of Argentina and Uruguay. During its continental spreading, it must have adapted to several biomes and temperature amplitudes, when founder events should have contributed to the high genetic divergence and geographical structure currently observed, reinforcing the speciation process. The first report of Lu. longipalpis in Uruguay was in 2010, calling the attention of Public Health authorities. Five years later, the parasite Le. infantum was recorded and in 2015 the first case of VL in canids was reported. Hitherto seven human deaths by VL have been reported in Uruguay. Here, we publish the first DNA sequences from the mitochondrial genes ND4 and CYTB of Lu. longipalpis collected in Uruguay, and we used these molecular markers to investigate their genetic variability and population structure. We described four new ND4 haplotypes in a total of 98 (4/98) and one CYTB in a total of 77 (1/77). As expected, we were able to establish that the Lu. longipalpis collected in two localities (i.e. Salto and Bella Union) from the north of Uruguay are closely related to the populations from neighbouring countries. We also propose that the possible route for the vector arrival to the region may have been through vegetation and forest corridors of the Uruguay River system, as well as it may have benefited from landscape modifications generated by commercial forestation. The ecological-scale processes shaping Lu. longipalpis populations, the identification of genetically homogeneous groups and the gene flow among them must be carefully investigated by using highly sensible molecular markers (i.e. genome wide SNPs) since it will help to the understanding of VL transmission and contribute to the planification of public policies on its control.

TI  - Linking land cover and species distribution models to project potential ranges of malaria vectors: an example using <i>Anopheles arabiensis</i> in Sudan and Upper Egypt
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
AB  - Background: Anopheles arabiensis is a particularly opportunistic feeder and efficient vector of Plasmodium falciparum in Africa and may invade areas outside its normal range, including areas separated by expanses of barren desert. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate how spatial models can project future irrigated cropland and potential, new suitable habitat for vectors such as An. arabiensis.
   Methods: Two different but complementary spatial models were linked to demonstrate their synergy for assessing re-invasion potential of An. arabiensis into Upper Egypt as a function of irrigated cropland expansion by 2050. The first model (The Land Change Modeler) was used to simulate changes in irrigated cropland using a Markov Chain approach, while the second model (MaxEnt) uses species occurrence points, land cover and other environmental layers to project probability of species presence. Two basic change scenarios were analysed, one involving a more conservative business-as-usual (BAU) assumption and second with a high probability of desert-to-cropland transition (Green Nile) to assess a broad range of potential outcomes by 2050.
   Results: The results reveal a difference of 82,000 sq km in potential An. arabiensis range between the BAU and Green Nile scenarios. The BAU scenario revealed a highly fragmented set of small, potential habitat patches separated by relatively large distances (maximum distance = 64.02 km, mean = 12.72 km, SD = 9.92), while the Green Nile scenario produced a landscape characterized by large patches separated by relatively shorter gaps (maximum distance = 49.38, km, mean = 4.51 km, SD = 7.89) that may be bridged by the vector.
   Conclusions: This study provides a first demonstration of how land change and species distribution models may be linked to project potential changes in vector habitat distribution and invasion potential. While gaps between potential habitat patches remained large in the Green Nile scenario, the models reveal large areas of future habitat connectivity that may facilitate the re-invasion of An. arabiensis from Sudan into Upper Egypt. The methods used are broadly applicable to other land cover changes as they influence vector distribution, particularly those related to tropical deforestation and urbanization processes.

TI  - The epidemiology of Mayaro virus in the Americas: A systematic review and key parameter estimates for outbreak modelling
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Mayaro virus (MAYV) is an arbovirus that is endemic to tropical forests in Central and South America, particularly within the Amazon basin. In recent years, concern has increased regarding MAYV's ability to invade urban areas and cause epidemics across the region. We conducted a systematic literature review to characterise the evolutionary history of MAYV, its transmission potential, and exposure patterns to the virus. We analysed data from the literature on MAYV infection to produce estimates of key epidemiological parameters, including the generation time and the basic reproduction number, R-0. We also estimated the force-of-infection (FOI) in epidemic and endemic settings. Seventy-six publications met our inclusion criteria. Evidence of MAYV infection in humans, animals, or vectors was reported in 14 Latin American countries. Nine countries reported evidence of acute infection in humans confirmed by viral isolation or reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). We identified at least five MAYV outbreaks. Seroprevalence from population based cross-sectional studies ranged from 21% to 72%. The estimated mean generation time of MAYV was 15.2 days (95% CrI: 11.7-19.8) with a standard deviation of 6.3 days (95% CrI: 4.2-9.5). The per-capita risk of MAYV infection (FOI) ranged between 0.01 and 0.05 per year. The mean R-0 estimates ranged between 2.1 and 2.9 in the Amazon basin areas and between 1.1 and 1.3 in the regions outside of the Amazon basin. Although MAYV has been identified in urban vectors, there is not yet evidence of sustained urban transmission. MAYV's enzootic cycle could become established in forested areas within cities similar to yellow fever virus.
   Author summary Each year, diseases that are transmitted by mosquitoes cause substantial deaths and disability across the world. We performed a systematic literature review of Mayaro virus (MAYV) and estimated key epidemiological parameters that can be used to improve future outbreak response. We estimated the generation time and basic reproduction number for a historical outbreak. Our results suggest that the force-of-infection of MAYV in endemic settings is low. We did not find evidence of substantial urban transmission of MAYV. Nevertheless, similarities between MAYV and yellow fever virus epidemiology suggest that MAYV could emerge in urban areas. Local transmission of MAYV has never been reported outside of Central and South America. Our results highlight the need to continue monitoring emerging arboviruses in the Americas.

TI  - Combining isothermal recombinase polymerase amplification with lateral flow assay for diagnosis of <i>P</i>. <i>cynomolgi</i> malaria infection
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Author summaryP. cynolmogi is zoonotic protozoa that cause malaria in both macaques and humans. In the past few years, the human infection rate from this parasite has risen throughout Southeast Asia. We have developed molecular testing for diagnosing P. cynolmogi based on a recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) combined with a lateral flow (LF) strip. The rapid, sensitive, and portable of our testing represents a promising assay for the P. cynomolgi diagnosis method.
   BackgroundPlasmodium cynomolgi is a nonhuman primate parasite that causes malaria in humans and is transmitted by the Anopheles mosquito. Macaques, the natural hosts of P. cynomolgi, are widely distributed in Asia, especially in Southeast Asia. Anthropogenic land-use changes and wildlife habitat reduction due to local environmental changes, deforestation, urban expansion, and construction increased the frequency of human-macaque-vector interactions and facilitated the emergence of zoonotic malaria, causing an exponential increase in the infection rates in this area. Although microscopic tools are the gold standard for malaria diagnosis, they have very low sensitivity. Therefore, disease control and prevention require rapid, sensitive and accurate diagnostic tests. Methodology/Principle findingsThis study aims to develop a diagnostic method using a recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) combined with a lateral flow (LF) strip method to specifically diagnose P. cynomolgi. Laboratory validation determined the method's sensitivity and specificity compared to the nested PCR method. The lower limit of detection was 22.14 copies/& mu;l of recombinant plasmid per reaction. The combination method represented 81.82% sensitivity and 94.74% specificity compared to the nested PCR. Conclusions/SignificanceThe diagnostic testing developed in this study combines a recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) and a lateral flow (LF) strip, offering rapid high sensitivity and specificity. Further development of this technique could make it a promising method for detecting P. cynomolgi.

TI  - Do frugivore population fluctuations reflect fruit production? Evidence from Panama
T2  - TROPICAL FRUITS AND FRUGIVORES: THE SEARCH FOR STRONG INTERACTORS
CP  - Symposium on Tropical Fruits and Frugivores - The Search for Strong Interactors
AB  - To conserve tropical mammals, it is important to understand factors affecting the range of population fluctuations that normally Occur over both the short and long term. Annual shifts in the population size of many species may be tied, at least in part, to phenological production patterns of plants, which in turn are often affected by climatic events. To examine the influence of annual fruit crop size on population dynamics of frugivorous mammals, we compared estimates of fruit production and the relative abundance of four frugivorous mammal species (agoutis, squirrels, capuchin monkeys, howler monkeys) for 15 years on Barro Colorado Island, Republic of Panama. Species differed in the magnitude of population fluctuation. Howler monkey population estimates showed little annual fluctuation and no significant relationship to fruit production. in contrast, population estimates for agoutis, squirrels and capuchin monkeys showed interannual fluctuations, at times dramatic, but these were not always concordant nor did they necessarily appear to relate to fruit production estimates, either within years or with a one-or two-year lag. Fruit production data suggest that, on average, in any given year only 20 to 30% of the mid-to-late rainy season species producing fruits important to frugivores will have an unusually good year; other species will have an average to sub-standard year. The next year, 20 to 30% of the other important fruit species in this temporal cohort will have an unusually good year-though one cannot predict in advance which species they will be. This oscillating production pattern makes it difficult to predict, except in extreme years, how the frugivore community or individual species will be affected by fruit availability. To draw conclusions on this topic, more detailed data are required on annual fruit production patterns of a representative sample of individuals of important fruit species as well as data on reproductive and other relevant traits of each mammal species. The possibility remains that many mammal populations may be affected more immediately by top-down factors Such as predators, parasites or disease rather than by bottom-up factors such as fruit availability. As population parameters fur each mammal species are likely influenced by a continuously varying combination of factors, barring effects of rare environmental events, the particular set of factors affecting the population dynamics of one frugivorous species in any given year may not necessarily impact similarly in that year on other frugivorous species at that same site.

TI  - Machine learning for cyanobacteria mapping on tropical urban reservoirs using PRISMA hyperspectral data
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Urban reservoirs are important for drinking water services and urban living. However, potentially toxic cyanobacteria blooms are frequently present due to human pollution and might threaten the urban water supply. Conveniently, cyanobacteria can be monitored by remote sensing-based approaches based on the spectral features of C-Phycocyanin (PC). Furthermore, methods leveraging Machine Learning Algorithms (MLA) for PC estimation from hyperspectral data have highlighted the potential to estimate PC more accurately - even at low concentrations. Since relatively few methodologies for PC retrieval in tropical environments have been developed or validated, this research evaluated PRISMA hyperspectral data processed with three MLA (Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boost, and Support Vector Machines) to estimate PC concentrations in the Billings reservoir, Brazil. The same MLA were used to generate PC models using Wordview-3 and Landsat-8/OLI simulated data to assess the potential gain of using hyperspectral over multispectral data. A PRISMA image was processed with three atmospheric correction methods and validated with co-located in-situ data, where the best atmospherically corrected product was used to generate synthetic Landsat-8/OLI and Worldview-3 images. The PC models were calibrated and validated through Monte Carlo simulation using field radiometric and biological data (Chlorophyll-a, PC, and phytoplankton taxonomy) collected in eight field campaigns (N = 115). The PRISMA and the synthetic multispectral images were used for a second round of models' validation using colocated PC measurements (match-up window +/- 4 h). The global PC Mixture Density Network was also applied to the PRISMA data, and the estimates were compared with the other MLA. The results showed that the standard PRISMA surface reflectance product provided the best atmospheric correction (MAE < 20% for the 500-700 nm bands), while ACOLITE and 6SV underperformed it from two to more than ten-fold. Cyanobacteria species were abundant in 96% of the taxonomical samples, even though relatively low PC concentrations were found (PC from 0 to 301.81 mu g/L and median PC = 2.9 mu g/L). The global Mixture Density Network sharply overestimated PC (MAE = 280% and Bias = 280%), potentially due to Billings reservoir's low PC:Chlorophyll-a ratio relative to the original training dataset. PRISMA/Random Forest (MAE = 45%) achieved the lowest error for orbital PC estimate, while Extreme Gradient Boost outperformed the other MLA using Worldview-3 (MAE = 49%) and Landsat-8 (MAE = 74%) synthetic imagery. Therefore, the results suggest hyperspectral and multispectral orbital data aligned with MLA are feasible for monitoring PC, even for waters containing low PC concentrations and reduced PC:Chlorophyll-a ratios.

TI  - Recent invasion and eradication of two members of the <i>Euwallacea fornicatus</i> species complex (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae) from tropical greenhouses in Europe
T2  - BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS
AB  - Ambrosia beetles of the Euwallacea fornicatus species complex are emerging tree pests with a broad host range including important agricultural crops. Native to Southeast Asia, these species were introduced into various countries, where they cause considerable damage to many tree species. Here we report several outbreaks of E. fornicatus s.l. in Europe. The first individuals were found in 2017 in a palm house of a botanical garden in Poznan (Poland) whereas in 2020 an outbreak was detected in a tropical greenhouse in Merano (Italy). In 2021, two additional outbreaks were detected in two greenhouses in Germany, in Erfurt and Berlin. For both cases in Germany it was possible to trace back the invasion to a distributor of exotic plants in the Netherlands where several infested plants were detected. Molecular analyses show that individuals from Poland and Italy are genetically identical but belong to a different mitochondrial clade than individuals in Germany which are identical to most individuals of two greenhouses in the Netherlands. Moreover, in the two greenhouses in the Netherlands we found beetles that belong to another haplotype of E. fornicatus and two haplotypes of E. perbrevis, a species in the E. fornicatus complex, which has not been previously intercepted in Europe. Our study provides novel insights into the invasion history of E. fornicatus and the eradication measures in Europe. Considering the potential of introduction and establishment of Euwallacea ambrosia beetles, particular attention should be paid to monitor the presence of these pests in tropical greenhouses across Europe.

TI  - Overwintering of West Nile Virus in the United States
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - The establishment of a tropical virus such as West Nile (WNV; Flaviviridae: Flavivirus) within the temperate latitudes of the continental United States was unexpected and perhaps contingent, in part, upon the ability of this invasive virus to persist during winter when temperatures become too cold for replication and vector mosquito gonotrophic activity. Our Forum article reviews research examining possible overwintering mechanisms that include consistent reintroduction and local persistence in vector mosquitoes and avian hosts, mostly using examples from research conducted in California. We conclude that the transmission of WNV involves so many vectors and hosts within different landscapes that multiple overwintering pathways are possible and collectively may be necessary to allow this virus to overwinter consistently within the United States.

TI  - A new species of <i>Stilestrongylus</i> (Nematoda, Heligmonellidae) from the Atlantic Forest of Misiones, Argentina, parasitic in <i>Euryoryzomys russatus</i> (Cricetidae, Sigmodontinae)
T2  - PARASITOLOGY RESEARCH
AB  - A new species of Heligmonellidae (Trichostrongylina, Heligmosomoidea), Stilestrongylus kaaguyporai n. sp. is described from the small intestine of Euryoryzomys russatus (Rodentia, Cricetidae, Sigmodontinae) from the Argentine Atlantic Forest, in the Misiones province. The new species was found at Campo Anexo Manuel Belgrano, Reserva de Vida Silvestre Urugua-i and Parque Provincial Urugua-i, with a prevalence of 73% in 15 hosts examined. Stilestrongylus includes 24 Neotropical species, all parasitic in rodents, mostly Sigmodontinae. Stilestrongylus kaaguyporai n. sp. can be differentiated from its congeners by the following characters: caudal bursa dissymmetrical with right lobe larger and pattern of type1-4 in both lobes, rays 6 not forming a lateral trident with rays 4 and 5, rays 8 with dissymmetrical pathway, genital cone hypertrophied with a conspicuous hood-like projection and females with a marked dorso-ventral torsion of the posterior end. This report is the second record of a Stilestrongylus species in E. russatus, increasing to nine the number of parasitic species known from this host.

TI  - Systematic review of the scrub typhus treatment landscape: Assessing the feasibility of an individual participant-level data (IPD) platform
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Author summary
   Scrub typhus is a febrile illness most commonly found in rural tropical areas. It is caused by a Gram-negative bacteria belonging to the family Rickettsiaceae and transmitted by mites when they feed on vertebrates. There is an estimate of one million cases annually, with an estimated one billion people at risk, mostly in Asia-Oceania. But relative to the scale of the problem, scrub typhus is largely understudied. Evidence-based treatment recommendations by policymakers vary or are non-existent. We searched databases and registries for prospective scrub typhus clinical treatment studies published from 1998 to 2020 and reviewed them. Data from clinical trials and particularly for specific groups, such as pregnant women and children, were minimal. The methods used to measure treatment efficacy were heterogeneous, making it difficult to directly compare or conduct a meta-analysis based on aggregated data. One way to improve the current level of evidence would be by pooling and analysing individual participant-level data (IPD), i.e. the raw data from individual participants in completed studies. This review demonstrated that there is scope for developing a database for individual participant data to enable more detailed analyses. IPD meta-analyses could be a way to address knowledge gaps such as optimum dosing for children and pregnant women.</p>
   Background
   Scrub typhus is an acute febrile illness caused by intracellular bacteria from the genus Orientia. It is estimated that one billion people are at risk, with one million cases annually mainly affecting rural areas in Asia-Oceania. Relative to its burden, scrub typhus is understudied, and treatment recommendations vary with poor evidence base. These knowledge gaps could be addressed by establishing an individual participant-level data (IPD) platform, which would enable pooled, more detailed and statistically powered analyses to be conducted. This study aims to assess the characteristics of scrub typhus treatment studies and explore the feasibility and potential value of developing a scrub typhus IPD platform to address unanswered research questions.</p> Methodology/principal findings
   We conducted a systematic literature review looking for prospective scrub typhus clinical treatment studies published from 1998 to 2020. Six electronic databases (Ovid Embase, Ovid Medline, Ovid Global Health, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Global Index Medicus), ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP were searched. We extracted data on study design, treatment tested, patient characteristics, diagnostic methods, geographical location, outcome measures, and statistical methodology.</p>
   Among 3,100 articles screened, 127 were included in the analysis. 12,079 participants from 12 countries were enrolled in the identified studies. ELISA, PCR, and eschar presence were the most commonly used diagnostic methods. Doxycycline, azithromycin, and chloramphenicol were the most commonly administered antibiotics. Mortality, complications, adverse events, and clinical response were assessed in most studies. There was substantial heterogeneity in the diagnostic methods used, treatment administered (including dosing and duration), and outcome assessed across studies. There were few interventional studies and limited data collected on specific groups such as children and pregnant women.</p> Conclusions/significance
   There were a limited number of interventional trials, highlighting that scrub typhus remains a neglected disease. The heterogeneous nature of the available data reflects the absence of consensus in treatment and research methodologies and poses a significant barrier to aggregating information across available published data without access to the underlying IPD. There is likely to be a substantial amount of data available to address knowledge gaps. Therefore, there is value for an IPD platform that will facilitate pooling and harmonisation of currently scattered data and enable in-depth investigation of priority research questions that can, ultimately, inform clinical practice and improve health outcomes for scrub typhus patients.</p>

TI  - Long-term retrospective assessment of a transmission hotspot for human alveolar echinococcosis in mid-west China
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   Human alveolar echinococcosis caused by infection with Echinococcus multilocularis is one of the most potentially pathogenic helminthic zoonoses. Transmission occurs involving wildlife cycles typically between fox and small mammal intermediate hosts. In the late 1980s/early 1990s a large focus of human AE was identified in poor upland agricultural communities in south Gansu Province, China. More detailed investigations in 1994-97 expanded community screening and identified key risk factors of dog ownership and landscape type around villages that could support susceptible rodent populations. A crash of the dog population (susceptible domestic definitive host) in the early 1990s appeared to stop transmission.
   Methodology/Findings
   We subsequently undertook follow-up eco-epidemiological studies based on human population screening and dog survey, in 2005/6 and in 2014/15. Our observations show a decrease in human AE prevalence, especially marked in the 11-30 year old age category. In 2015, although the dog population had recovered and in addition, forest protection and the reforestation of some areas may have favoured red fox (wild definitive host) population growth, there was no evidence of infection in owned dogs.
   Conclusions/Significance
   Those observations suggest that over decades socio-ecological changes resulted in a cascade of factors that exacerbated and then interrupted parasite emergence, with probable elimination of peri-domestic transmission of E. multilocularis in this area, despite the relative proximity of large active transmission foci on the eastern Tibetan Plateau. This study case exemplifies how anthropogenic land use and behavioural changes can modify emergence events and the transmission of endemic zoonotic parasite infections, and subsequently the importance of considering processes over the long-term in a systems approach in order to understand pathogen and disease distribution.

TI  - Genetic stability among temporally and geographically diverse isolates of Barmah Forest virus
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - An increase in the incidence of polyarthritis caused by Barmah Forest (BF) virus, and its recent emergence into Western Australia, prompted a study of the molecular epidemiology of this Australian mosquito-borne alphavirus. The nucleotide sequence of a 500-basepair region of the 3' end of the envelope (E2) gene of the prototype BF virus strain (BH2193) was compared with other members of the alphavirus genus, and to a panel of isolates of BF virus collected more for than 20 years from different geographic regions of Australia. The BF virus was shown to be genetically distinct from other members of the alphavirus genus. A high degree of sequence homology (98-100%) was found between the BF isolates, with no evidence of geographic or temporal divergence. This nucleotide homogeneity was similar to that observed with other Australian mosquito-borne viruses with avian vertebrate hosts, such as Sindbis, Murray Valley, and Kunjin viruses, but it contrasts to the heterogeneity reported for Ross River virus, an alphavirus with mammalian vertebrate hosts.

TI  - Host phylogeny and seasonality shapes avian haemosporidian prevalence in a Brazilian biodiverse and dry forest: the Caatinga
T2  - PARASITOLOGY
AB  - The relationships between host phylogenetics, functional traits and parasites in wildlife remain poorly understood in the Neotropics, especially in habitats with marked seasonal variation. Here, we examined the effect of seasonality and host functional traits on the prevalence of avian haemosporidians (Plasmodium and Haemoproteus) in the Brazilian Caatinga, a seasonally dry tropical forest. 933 birds were evaluated for haemosporidian infections. We found a high parasitism prevalence (51.2%), which was correlated with phylogenetic relatedness among avian species. Prevalence varied drastically among the 20 well-sampled species, ranging from 0 to 70%. Seasonality was the main factor associated with infections, but how this abiotic condition influenced parasite prevalence varied according to the host-parasite system. Plasmodium prevalence increased during the rainy season and, after excluding the large sample size of Columbiformes (n = 462/933), Plasmodium infection rate was maintained high in the wet season and showed a negative association with host body mass. No association was found between non-Columbiform bird prevalence and seasonality or body mass when evaluating both Plasmodium and Haemoproteus or only Haemoproteus infections. Parasite community was composed of 32 lineages including 7 new lineages. We evidenced that even dry domains can harbour a high prevalence and diversity of vector-borne parasites and pointed out seasonality as a ruling factor.

TI  - A Large Outbreak of Thiamine Deficiency among Illegal Gold Miners in French Guiana
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - From September 2013 to July 2014, several gold miners working in the tropical forest consulted the Maripasoula Health Center in French Guiana for edema and findings consistent with right-sided cardiac failure. Of the 42 cases of beriberi that were diagnosed, one patient died. The laboratory and clinical investigation demonstrated vitamin B1 deficiency in most of the patients tested. Furthermore, 30 of 42 patients responded favorably to 500 mg of intravenous or intramuscular thiamine supplementation. In addition, dietary investigation showed insufficient thiamine intake in these patients. We concluded that patients had acquired beriberi because of diet restrictions, hard labor, and infectious diseases, notably malaria. In 2016, cases were still being reported. We recommend screening for compatible symptoms in gold miners, thiamine supplementation, and nutritional intervention.

TI  - Plague Circulation and Population Genetics of the Reservoir <i>Rattus rattus</i>: The Influence of Topographic Relief on the Distribution of the Disease within the Madagascan Focus
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background: Landscape may affect the distribution of infectious diseases by influencing the population density and dispersal of hosts and vectors. Plague (Yersinia pestis infection) is a highly virulent, re-emerging disease, the ecology of which has been scarcely studied in Africa. Human seroprevalence data for the major plague focus of Madagascar suggest that plague spreads heterogeneously across the landscape as a function of the relief. Plague is primarily a disease of rodents. We therefore investigated the relationship between disease distribution and the population genetic structure of the black rat, Rattus rattus, the main reservoir of plague in Madagascar.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We conducted a comparative study of plague seroprevalence and genetic structure (15 microsatellite markers) in rat populations from four geographic areas differing in topology, each covering about 150-200 km(2) within the Madagascan plague focus. The seroprevalence levels in the rat populations mimicked those previously reported for humans. As expected, rat populations clearly displayed a more marked genetic structure with increasing relief. However, the relationship between seroprevalence data and genetic structure differs between areas, suggesting that plague distribution is not related everywhere to the effective dispersal of rats.
   Conclusions/Significance: Genetic diversity estimates suggested that plague epizootics had only a weak impact on rat population sizes. In the highlands of Madagascar, plague dissemination cannot be accounted for solely by the effective dispersal of the reservoir. Human social activities may also be involved in spreading the disease in rat and human populations.

TI  - Sepsis caused by Chromobacterium violaceum - probably the first case in Europe, or <i>Macbeth</i> read anew
T2  - ANNALS OF AGRICULTURAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICINE
AB  - Rare diseases, almost by definition, present us with diagnostic as well as therapeutic difficulties as. They also include infectious diseases outside endemic areas. Without expecting them, we are not preparing to fight them. Like Macbeth, we feel safe, convinced that tropical diseases do not reach us, like Birnam forest towards his castle. Nevertheless, the forest moved according to the prophecy of the three witches, and in a similar way tropical flora is moving towards us according to the predictions of environmentalists. This is illustrated by the history of the presented patient, who was admitted to hospital because of sepsis caused by Chromobacterium violaceum (CV), a Gram-negative facultatively anaerobic, oxidase-positive bacterium producing a dark violet antioxidant pigment called violacein. This is probably the first documented case report of sepsis in this part of the world. To the best of the authors' knowledge, the patient is the first to require dialysis after Chromobacterium violaceum infection.

TI  - Floral attraction and flower visitors of a subcanopy, tropical rainforest tree, <i>Fontainea picrosperma</i>
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB  - Flowering plants in tropical rainforests rely heavily on pollen vectors for successful reproduction. Research into pollination systems in tropical rainforests is dominated by canopy species, while subcanopy plant-pollinator interactions remain under-represented. The microclimate beneath the rainforest canopy is characterized by low light levels and is markedly different from the canopy environment that receives more light energy. We studied the floral attractants and floral visitors of a dioecious, subcanopy tree, Fontainea picrosperma (Euphorbiaceae), in the Wet Tropics bioregion of northern Queensland, Australia. We found that wind pollination is rare and male and female flowers do not produce nectar. Female flowers are likely pollinated due to their perceptual similarity to pollen-offering male flowers. Female flowers had the same scent profile as male flowers, and floral scent was an important floral attractant that acted to regulate pollinator behavior. The two most abundant scent compounds present in the floral bouquet were benzyl alcohol and 4-oxoisophorone. These compounds are ubiquitous in nature and are known to attract a wide variety of insects. Both day-time and night-time pollinators contributed to successful pollen deposition on the stigma, and diurnal flower visitors were identified from several orders of insects including beetles, flies, predatory wasps, and thrips. Fontainea picrosperma is therefore likely to be pollinated by a diverse array of small insects. Synthesis. Our data indicate that F. picrosperma has a generalist, entomophilous pollination syndrome. The rainforest subcanopy is a distinctive environment characterized by low light levels, low or turbulent wind speeds, and relatively high humidity. Female flowers of F. picrosperma exhibit cost-saving strategies by not producing nectar and mimicking the smell of reward-offering male flowers. Insects opportunistically forage on or inhabit flowers, and pollination occurs from a pool of small insects with low energy requirements that are found beneath the rainforest canopy.

TI  - Estimation of gene flow in the tropical-rainforest tree <i>Neobalanocarpus heimii</i> (Dipterocarpaceae), inferred from paternity analysis
T2  - MOLECULAR ECOLOGY
AB  - Pollen flow and population genetic structure among 30 potentially flowering individuals of Neobalanocarpus heimii, a tropical emergent tree, were investigated in a lowland tropical rainforest of Malaysia using microsatellite polymorphism. The 248 offspring in the vicinity of five reproductive trees of the 30 potentially flowering trees were used in paternity analysis for pollen-flow study. Four primer pairs, developed in different species of dipterocarps, were adopted to detect microsatellite polymorphism. Based upon microsatellite polymorphism pollen flow and seed migration were detected. Pollen-flow events of more than 400 m were observed directly, based on paternity analysis in the study plot. The estimated average mating distance of the five reproductive trees was 524 m. This result suggests that reproduction of this species is mediated by a long-distance pollinator. The haplotypes of some offspring were not compatible with the nearest reproductive tree. Thus, the results suggest that some seeds are dispersed by a seed dispersal vector. Investigation of genetic structure showed significant and negative correlation of genetic relatedness and spatial distances between the 30 potentially flowering trees, but this correlation was weak. We suggest that long-distance gene flow and seed migration are responsible for the poorly developed genetic structure of this species.

TI  - A Survey in Natural Forest Ecosystems of Vietnam Reveals High Diversity of both New and Described <i>Phytophthora</i> Taxa including <i>P</i>. <i>ramorum</i>
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - In 2016 and 2017, surveys of Phytophthora diversity were performed in 25 natural and semi-natural forest stands and 16 rivers in temperate and subtropical montane and tropical lowland regions of Vietnam. Using baiting assays from soil samples and rivers and direct isolations from naturally fallen leaves, 13 described species, five informally designated taxa and 21 previously unknown taxa of Phytophthora were isolated from 58 of the 91 soil samples (63.7%) taken from the rhizosphere of 52 of the 64 woody plant species sampled (81.3%) in 20 forest stands (83.7%), and from all rivers: P. capensis, P. citricola VII, VIII, IX, X and XI, P. sp. botryosa-like 2, P. sp. meadii-like 1 and 2, P. sp. tropicalis-like 2 and P. sp. multivesiculata-like 1 from Phytophthora major phylogenetic Clade 2; P. castaneae and P. heveae from Clade 5; P. chlamydospora, P. gregata, P. sp. bitahaiensis-like and P. sp. sylvatica-like 1, 2 and 3 from Clade 6; P. cinnamomi (Pc), P. parvispora, P. attenuata, P. sp. attenuata-like 1, 2 and 3 and P. xheterohybrida from Clade 7; P. drechsleri, P. pseudocryptogea, P. ramorum (Pr) and P. sp. kelmania from Clade 8, P. macrochlamydospora, P. sp. xinsolita-like, P. sp. xkunnunara-like, P. sp. xvirginiana-like s.l. and three new taxa, P. sp. quininea-like, P. sp. xGrenada 3-like and P. sp. xPeru 4-like, from Clade 9; and P. sp. gallica-like 1 and 2 from Clade 10. The Al and A2 mating types of both Pc and Pr co-occurred. The A2 mating type of Pc was associated with severe dieback of montane forests in northern Vietnam. Most other Phytophthora species, including Pr, were not associated with obvious disease symptoms. It is concluded that (1) Vietnam is within the center of origin of most Phytophthora taxa found including Pc and Pr, and (2) Phytophthora clades 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 are native to Indochina.

TI  - Estimating Forest Aboveground Biomass by Combining Optical and SAR Data: A Case Study in Genhe, Inner Mongolia, China
T2  - SENSORS
AB  - Estimation of forest aboveground biomass is critical for regional carbon policies and sustainable forest management. Passive optical remote sensing and active microwave remote sensing both play an important role in the monitoring of forest biomass. However, optical spectral reflectance is saturated in relatively dense vegetation areas, and microwave backscattering is significantly influenced by the underlying soil when the vegetation coverage is low. Both of these conditions decrease the estimation accuracy of forest biomass. A new optical and microwave integrated vegetation index (VI) was proposed based on observations from both field experiments and satellite (Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and RADARSAT-2) data. According to the difference in interaction between the multispectral reflectance and microwave backscattering signatures with biomass, the combined VI (COVI) was designed using the weighted optical optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI) and microwave horizontally transmitted and vertically received signal (HV) to overcome the disadvantages of both data types. The performance of the COVI was evaluated by comparison with those of the sole optical data, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, and the simple combination of independent optical and SAR variables. The most accurate performance was obtained by the models based on the COVI and optical and microwave optimal variables excluding OSAVI and HV, in combination with a random forest algorithm and the largest number of reference samples. The results also revealed that the predictive accuracy depended highly on the statistical method and the number of sample units. The validation indicated that this integrated method of determining the new VI is a good synergistic way to combine both optical and microwave information for the accurate estimation of forest biomass.

TI  - Successional loss of two key food tree species best explains decline in group size of Panamanian howler monkeys (<i>Alouatta palliata</i>)
T2  - BIOTROPICA
AB  - Negative impacts of discrete, short-term disturbances to wildlife populations are well-documented. The consequences of more gradual environmental change are less apparent and harder to study because they play out over longer periods and are often indirect in their action. Yet, they can drive the decline of wildlife populations even in seemingly pristine and currently well-protected habitats. One such environmental change is a successional shift in a community's species composition as it regenerates from disturbance caused by past human land use. Early and middle successional tree species often provide key foods to folivores and frugivores, but the abundance of these resources drops as the forest matures, with adverse repercussions for these consumers. Our 44-year record (1974-2018) of howler monkey (Alouatta palliata) group sizes and demographic composition from Barro Colorado Island, Panama, a protected reserve, documents an example of this phenomenon. After 70 years of relative stability, the mean size of howler monkey groups exhibited a marked decline, beginning in 2003. This downward trajectory in group size has continued through the most recent census in 2018. The composition of howler groups also changed significantly during the study period, with the patterns of decline differing among age/sex classes. There is no evidence that these changes were caused by increased rates of emigration, group fission, predation, parasitism, or disease. Rather, they are best explained by an island-wide, succession-driven decline in the densities of two species of free-standing fig trees, Ficus yoponensis and F. insipida, which together were providing ~36% of BCI howlers' annual diet. in Spanish is available with online material.

TI  - Building social resilience to biological invasions. A case study of Panama Tropical Race 4 in the Australian Banana Industry
T2  - GEOFORUM
AB  - Biosecurity is often conceptualised and managed as an issue of biological risk. However, biosecurity policy and programs need to also manage for the social risks and impacts of biological invasions. This paper applies theory on the social aspects of social-ecological system resilience to understand how growers from the Queensland Banana industry in north east Australia coped with the social impacts of the Panama Tropical Race 4 incursion. We present a conceptual framework that highlights how emergency responses can also support programs to build and enhance the social resilience of affected actors. Management programs and activities can be designed to support affected actors to cope with the impacts of the invasion, at the same time as working to eradicate or contain the invasive species. Short term immediate management actions coupled with developing institutions and process to support and build social resilience of actors in the longer-term, may enable them to learn to live with a new species in the landscape, and, or be able to better cope with the social impacts of future invasions.

TI  - THE MICROCLIMATE OF MAIZE AND BEAN CROPS IN TROPICAL AMERICA - A COMPARISON BETWEEN MONOCULTURES AND POLYCULTURES PLANTED AT HIGH AND LOW-DENSITY
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
AB  - This study characterizes the microclimates of maize and bean crops planted in monocultures and polycultures at two planting densities in Costa Rica. The hypothesis that the density and mixture of plants affects the microclimate within a field is evaluated as part of a larger study to identify environmental factors relevant to the spread of disease by insects in tropical agricultural systems.
   In general, the results support the findings of many previous studies that the density and morphological characteristics of the plants strongly influence the microclimate within an agricultural field. This research differed from most agricultural microclimate studies in that fields planted at two densities with different mixtures of plants were observed concurrently in tropical America.

TI  - Knowlesi malaria: Human risk factors, clinical spectrum, and pathophysiology
T2  - CURRENT RESEARCH ON NATURALLY TRANSMITTED PLASMODIUM KNOWLESI
AB  - Plasmodium knowlesi is endemic across Southeast Asia, and is the commonest cause of zoonotic malaria. The spectrum of clinical disease from P. knowlesi infection ranges from asymptomatic infection, through to severe malaria and death. Over 90% of clinical disease occurs in adults, mostly living in forest edge areas undergoing intensive land use change. With a 24-h asexual life cycle in humans, high parasite counts are possible, but most clinical cases of knowlesi malaria are uncomplicated with low parasitaemia. In co-endemic areas, median parasitaemia in knowlesi malaria is lower than that seen in vivax and falciparum malaria, suggesting a lower fever threshold. Severe malaria occurs in 6-9% of symptomatic adults. Manifestations of severe malaria from P. knowlesi are similar to those seen with falciparum malaria, with the notable absence of coma. Age, parasitaemia, cardiovascular comorbidities and delayed diagnosis are risk factors for severe disease and death, which are only seen in adults. Thrombocytopenia is near-universal in adults, likely related to platelet-red cell binding and clearance. Mechanisms underlying the microvascular sludging seen in fatal disease in non-natural primate hosts and the microvascular accumulation of parasites in fatal human disease are not clear. Marked reductions in deformability of both infected and uninfected red blood cells are associated with disease severity in both humans and other non-natural primate hosts, likely contributing to impaired microvascular perfusion and organ dysfunction. Endothelial activation, endothelial dysfunction, glycocalyx degradation and haemolysis are also associated with, and likely contribute to, severe disease and organ dysfunction, particularly acute kidney injury.

TI  - Plant Virus Identification and Management
T2  - RESEARCH JOURNAL OF BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB  - Plant diseases are a reason for relentless losses to mankind in numerous ways, which can be at a greater level or at a lesser amount in terms of severity. In fact many of the plant diseases are responsible for less vivid losses annually across the globe, though collectively they constitute considerable losses to farmers. Such infectious diseases affect the aesthetic values of plants either grown in fields, as landscape trees, in the home gardens etc. Among all the reported plant diseases, diseases caused by viruses are quite important to consider as there is still no precise cure to control them from spreading international boundaries. Occurrence of vector transmitted virus diseases and the harm they caused to crops (vegetable and fruits) are accounted to be growing in countries having a favourable tropical and subtropical environment.
   In order to counter such problem/disease, an integrated approach to crop management should to be on priority basis ranging from growing virus-resistant crops to device strategies for appropriate control of plant-virus insect-vectors. However, in the developing nations, employing such management practices is more challenging and is rarely applied effectively. All the available management practices can be classified into two broad principles of action i.e. prevention (prophylaxis in some early writings) and therapy (treatment or cure).

TI  - Prevalence of Human-Active and Variant 1 Strains of the Tick-Borne Pathogen <i>Anaplasma phagocytophilum</i> in Hosts and Forests of Eastern North America
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Anaplasmosis is an emerging infectious disease caused by infection with the bacterium Anaplasma phagocytophilum. In the eastern United States, A. phagocytophilum is transmitted to hosts through the bite of the blacklegged tick, Ixodes scapularis. We determined the realized reservoir competence of 14 species of common vertebrate hosts for ticks by establishing the probability that each species transmits two important strains of A. phagocytophilum (A. phagocytophilum human-active, which causes human cases, and A. phagocytophilum variant 1, which does not) to feeding larval ticks. We also sampled questing nymphal ticks from similar to 150 sites in a single county over 2 years and sampled over 6 years at one location. White-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) and Eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus) were the most competent reservoirs for infection with the A. phagocytophilum human-active strain. Across the county, prevalence in ticks for both strains together was 8.3%; ticks were more than two times as likely to be infected with A. phagocytophilum human-active as A. phagocytophilum variant 1.

TI  - Proximity to rainforest enhances pollination and fruit set in orchards
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - 1. Tropical rainforests are potential reservoirs of insects that could enhance crop pollination, but only a few instances of the provision of such services by tropical rainforest insects have been reported. Our field study aimed to determine the relative importance of such insects to the pollination of macadamia Macadamia integrifolia and longan Dimocarpus longan crops on the Atherton Tableland, north Queensland, Australia.
   2. We quantified initial fruit set, a measure of pollination success, in treatments designed to assess the relative importance of the possible modes of pollination. The treatments were applied in orchards that varied in distance from rainforest, in order to compare the effects of the contrasting pools of available pollen vectors. We also recorded the insect species present and estimated the number of visits each made to flowers in crops near and far from rainforest.
   3. For both crops there was an interaction between pollination treatment and distance from rainforest. Maximum fruit set was only achieved when pollen vectors had access to flowers and orchards were close to rainforest. Exclusion of pollinators near rainforest reduced initial fruit set to a greater extent than exclusion of pollinators far from rainforest.
   4. We confirmed that pollen transfer in macadamia is by autogamous self-pollination and by pollen vectors, but our design did not distinguish among pollen vectors. The only abundant insects in macadamia orchards were honeybees Apis mellifera. There were more honeybee visits to macadamia flowers in orchards near rainforest than far from rainforest, but we detected no relationship between honeybee visits and initial macadamia fruit set in our sample of observations on a per raceme basis. More detailed studies are needed to identify the pollen vector responsible for enhanced pollination of macadamia near rainforest.
   5. We established for the first time that pollen transfer in longan is by a combination of autogamous self-pollination, wind and bees. Longan flowers were visited by stingless bees and honeybees but only stingless bees had a positive relationship with initial longan fruit set and higher visitation rates near rainforest than far from rainforest. This suggests that enhanced pollination in longan near rainforest resulted primarily from a more abundant supply of stingless bees from the rainforest.
   6. Synthesis and applications. By demonstrating that tropical rainforest can act as a reservoir of pollen vectors that benefit crops, our study highlights the existence of a largely unrecognized resource available to agriculture. At the same time our results make a significant contribution to the growing database of studies that underscore the importance of tropical rainforest conservation. Policy and management aimed at sustainable use of this resource would satisfy the goals both of agriculturalists, to improve crop yields, and conservationists, to conserve tropical rainforest.

TI  - Mosquitoes of the Caatinga: 1. Adults stage survey and the emerge of seven news species endemic of a dry tropical forest in Brazil
T2  - ACTA TROPICA
AB  - The Caatinga is the least known Brazilian biome in terms of the diversity of Culicidae. No systematic study of the diversity or ecology of the mosquitoes of this biome is available, despite the importance of vector diseases in Brazil. The present study addressed the mosquito biodiversity in the Caatinga biome by sampling adult populations. Specimens were sampled monthly from March 2013 to September 2014 in a Caatinga conservation unit located in the Brazilian semiarid zone. Mosquito collections were carried out in Shannon traps from late afternoon to early evening, and manual aspiration was used to capture diurnal species as well. A total of 4,692 mosquitoes were collected. The most dominant and constant species were all undescribed species belonging to the genera Wyeomyia and Runchomyia, which together represented 80% of the specimens. The most abundant species of epidemiological importance was Haemagogus (Con.) leucocelaenus. The abundance of mosquitoes was positively associated with the relative humidity and temperature recorded during the month preceding the collection date. In the Caatinga, the diversity of adult mosquitoes was associated with the availability (quantity and diversity) of natural larval habitats found in the different phytophysiognomies of the biome, which vary according to temperature and humidity. The number of species unknown to science reflects the levels of endemism that exist in the study area, and reinforces the need to further taxonomic investigation in the biome. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Malaria transmission in two rural communities in the forest zone of Ghana
T2  - PARASITOLOGY RESEARCH
AB  - Malaria transmission was assessed in two rural communities, Kona and Afamanaso in Sekyere South district, Ashanti Region, in the forest zone of Ghana to provide baseline data for ongoing clinical studies and the evaluation of the effect of interventions. Altogether, 3,479 Anopheles gambiae and 1,157 Anopheles funestus were caught by human landing catches. Sporozoite rates determined by either microscopy of salivary glands or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for Plasmodium falciparum in the two villages were 6.6% vs. 8.9% for the main vector A. gambiae and 3.2% vs. 6.3% for A. funestus. ELISA tests of dissected specimens compared to microscopy of salivary glands were 1.3 and 2.0 times more positive for A. gambiae and A. funestus, respectively. Plasmodium infections of 122 microscopically positive salivary glands of A. gambiae were identified by real-time PCR as 95 (77.9%) P. falciparum, 7 (5.7%) Plasmodium malariae, 7 (5.7%) Plasmodium ovale and 1 (0.8%) mixed infection of P. falciparum and P. malariae. Transmission in the area was found to be intense and perennial with some seasonal variations during the study period from Dec. 2003 to Aug. 2005. Although the two villages were only 10 km apart from each other, Annual Biting Rates (ABRs) and Annual Entomological Inoculation Rates (AEIRs) were much higher at Afamanaso (11,643 vs. 866) than at Kona (5,329 vs. 490). Most of the transmission (91.4%) occurred during bedtime hours from 21 to 6 h. It is important to note that there was still a substantial transmission before 21 h with AEIRs of 57.3 at Afamanso and 38.7 at Kona. The distribution of impregnated bednets alone, therefore, may not be sufficiently effective.

TI  - Identifying the Most Probable Mammal Reservoir Hosts for Monkeypox Virus Based on Ecological Niche Comparisons
T2  - VIRUSES-BASEL
AB  - Previous human cases or epidemics have suggested that Monkeypox virus (MPXV) can be transmitted through contact with animals of African rainforests. Although MPXV has been identified in many mammal species, most are likely secondary hosts, and the reservoir host has yet to be discovered. In this study, we provide the full list of African mammal genera (and species) in which MPXV was previously detected, and predict the geographic distributions of all species of these genera based on museum specimens and an ecological niche modelling (ENM) method. Then, we reconstruct the ecological niche of MPXV using georeferenced data on animal MPXV sequences and human index cases, and conduct overlap analyses with the ecological niches inferred for 99 mammal species, in order to identify the most probable animal reservoir. Our results show that the MPXV niche covers three African rainforests: the Congo Basin, and Upper and Lower Guinean forests. The four mammal species showing the best niche overlap with MPXV are all arboreal rodents, including three squirrels: Funisciurus anerythrus, Funisciurus pyrropus, Heliosciurus rufobrachium, and Graphiurus lorraineus. We conclude that the most probable MPXV reservoir is F. anerythrus based on two niche overlap metrics, the areas of higher probabilities of occurrence, and available data on MPXV detection.

TI  - Publishing data to support the fight against human vector-borne diseases
T2  - GIGASCIENCE
AB  - Vector-borne diseases are responsible formore than 17% of human cases of infectious diseases. Inmost situations, effective control of debilitating and deadly vector-bone diseases (VBDs), such as malaria, dengue, chikungunya, yellowfever, Zika and Chagas requires upto-date, robust and comprehensive information on the presence, diversity, ecology, bionomics and geographic spread of the organisms that carry and transmit the infectious agents. Huge gaps exist in the information related to these vectors, creating an essential need for campaigns to mobilise and share data. The publication of data papers is an effective tool for overcoming this challenge. These peer-reviewed articles provide scholarly credit for researchers whose vital work of assembling and publishingwell-described, properly formatted datasets often fails to receive appropriate recognition. To address this, GigaScience's sister journal GigaByte partnered with the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) to publish a series of data papers, with support from the Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR), hosted by theWorld Health Organisation (WHO). Here we outline the initial results of this targeted approach to sharing data and describe its importance for controlling VBDs and improving public health.

TI  - Land Use/Land Cover Mapping Using Multitemporal Sentinel-2 Imagery and Four Classification Methods-A Case Study from Dak Nong, Vietnam
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Information on land use and land cover (LULC) including forest cover is important for the development of strategies for land planning and management. Satellite remotely sensed data of varying resolutions have been an unmatched source of such information that can be used to produce estimates with a greater degree of confidence than traditional inventory estimates. However, use of these data has always been a challenge in tropical regions owing to the complexity of the biophysical environment, clouds, and haze, and atmospheric moisture content, all of which impede accurate LULC classification. We tested a parametric classifier (logistic regression) and three non-parametric machine learning classifiers (improved k-nearest neighbors, random forests, and support vector machine) for classification of multi-temporal Sentinel 2 satellite imagery into LULC categories in Dak Nong province, Vietnam. A total of 446 images, 235 from the year 2017 and 211 from the year 2018, were pre-processed to gain high quality images for mapping LULC in the 6516 km(2) study area. The Sentinel 2 images were tested and classified separately for four temporal periods: (i) dry season, (ii) rainy season, (iii) the entirety of the year 2017, and (iv) the combination of dry and rainy seasons. Eleven different LULC classes were discriminated of which five were forest classes. For each combination of temporal image set and classifier, a confusion matrix was constructed using independent reference data and pixel classifications, and the area on the ground of each class was estimated. For overall temporal periods and classifiers, overall accuracy ranged from 63.9% to 80.3%, and the Kappa coefficient ranged from 0.611 to 0.813. Area estimates for individual classes ranged from 70 km(2) (1% of the study area) to 2200 km(2) (34% of the study area) with greater uncertainties for smaller classes.

TI  - Is <i>Markhamia lutea</i>'s abundance determined by animal foraging?
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Understanding the determinants of tropical forest tree richness and spatial distribution is a central goal of forest ecology; however, the role of herbivorous mammals has received little attention. Here we explore the potential for red colobus monkeys (Procolobus rufomitratus) to influence the abundance of Markhamia lutea trees in a tropical forest by feeding extensively on the tree's flowers, such that this tree population is not able to regularly set fruit. Using 14 years of data from Kibale National Park, Uganda, we quantify M. lutea flower and fruit production. Similarly, using 21 years of data, we quantify temporal changes in the abundance of stems in size classes from 1 m tall and above. Our analyses demonstrate that M. lutea is rarely able to produce fruit and that this corresponds to a general decline in its abundance across all size classes. Moreover, using 7 years of feeding records, we demonstrate that red colobus feed on M. lutea, consuming large amounts of leaf and flower buds whenever they were available, suggesting that this behavior limits fruit production. Therefore, we suggest that red colobus are presently important for structuring the distribution and abundance of M. lutea in Kibale. This dynamic raises the intriguing question of how a large M. lutea population was able to originally establish. There is no evidence of a change in red colobus population size; however, if this old-growth forest is in a non-equilibrium state, M. lutea may have become established when red colobus ate a different diet.

TI  - Effectiveness of snap and A24-automated traps and broadcast anticoagulant bait in suppressing commensal rodents in Hawaii
T2  - HUMAN-WILDLIFE INTERACTIONS
AB  - Commensal rodents (invasive rats, Rattus spp.; house mice, Mus musculus) are well established globally. They threaten human health by disease transfer and impact economies by causing agricultural damage. On island landscapes, they are frequent predators of native species and affect biodiversity. To provide managers with better information regarding methods to suppress commensal rodent populations in remote island forests, in 2016 we evaluated the effectiveness of continuous rat trapping using snap-traps, Goodnature (R) A24 self-resetting rat traps, and a 1-time (2-application) hand-broadcast of anticoagulant rodenticide bait pellets (Diphacinone-50) applied at 13.8 kg/ha per application in a 5-ha forest on Oahu, Hawaii, USA. We compared rat and mouse abundance at the rat trapping site to a reference site by monitoring rodent tracking tunnels, which are baited ink cards in tunnels that allow footprints of animal visitors to be identified. We found that trapping reduced rat, but not mouse, abundance. The rodenticide treatment did not further reduce rat populations (P = 0.139), but temporarily reduced the mouse populations (P < 0.001; from 33% tracking to 0% for 1.3 months). Our study highlighted the role of continuous trapping for rats and rodenticide baiting for mice as effective methods to suppress commensal rodent populations in remote island forests to protect native species biodiversity.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY
AB  - The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a DNA virus that infects 90% of the human population, is responsible for certain cutaneous lymphomas (extranodal NK/T-cell lymhoma, hydroa vacciniforme lymphoproliferative disorder, lymphomatoid granulomatosis, others), and can be associated with a variety of cutaneous manifestations (eg, infectious mononucleosis, severe mosquito bite allergy, chronic active EBV disease, Gianotti-Crosti syndrome). EBV-related skin disorders are frequent in certain populations (South and Cental America, Africa, Asia, and Oceania) and can be diagnostically challenging. The human T-lymphotropic virus type-1 is a retrovirus, which is known to be associated with adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, neurologic disorders, but also cutaneous non-neoplastic manifestations (infective dermatitis, infections, and infestations). We performed an updated revision of the clinical dermatologic and histopathologic findings associated with the cutaneous non-neoplastic and preneoplastic disorders occurring in association with the EBV and human T-lymphotropic virus type-1.

TI  - Tracing tropical soil parent material analysis via portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) spectrometry in Brazilian Cerrado
T2  - GEODERMA
AB  - Parent material (PM) type is crucial for understanding the distribution of soils across the landscape. However, such information is not available at a detailed scale in Brazil. Thus, portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) spectrometry can aid in PM characterization by measuring elemental concentrations. This work focused on mapping soil PM (specifically variations of phyllite) using pXRF data and evaluating which soil horizon (A, B, or C) provides optimal PM identification in the Brazilian Cerrado. A total of 120 soil samples were collected from A, B, and C horizons across the study area as well as associated PMs; all were subjected to pXRF analysis. Artificial neural network, support vector machine, and random forest were used to model and predict PMs through pXRF data to the entire area. The nine maps (3 soil horizons data x 3 algorithms) generated for PM prediction were validated through overall accuracy, Kappa coefficient, producer's, and user's accuracy. The most accurate PM maps were obtained by using C horizon information (overall accuracy of 0.87 and Kappa coefficient of 0.79) via support vector machine algorithm. Land use dramatically influenced the results. In sum, pXRF data can be successfully used to predict soil PMs by robust algorithms. Specifically, V, Ni, Sr, and Pb were optimal for predicting PM regardless of land use.

TI  - A TEMPORARY FOCUS OF SAVANNA SPECIES OF THE SIMULIUM-DAMNOSUM COMPLEX IN THE FOREST ZONE OF LIBERIA
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND PARASITOLOGY
AB  - Savanna species of the Simulium damnosum complex, the major vectors of the blinding savanna type of onchocerciasis, were considered to be rare in Liberia, until the dry season of 1988.  In 1988 they became a serious nuisance, biting people at the Bong iron ore mine within the rain forest zone.  S. damnosum s.str. and S. sirbanum were found breeding, in association with S. adersi a non man-biting savanna species, in a stream emerging from the mine's tailings pond.  The local forest species were extremely rare in this stream.  The water of the stream was characterized by an increased hardness and higher temperatures in comparison with those of natural watercourses in the area.  The mass occurrence of flies was probably related to expansions of the tailings ponds, when rich nutrition was provided for the blackfly larvae by the decaying forests submerged by the rising water levels.  The phenomenon did not recur in 1989 when only a few savanna flies were caught, and none were seen in the dry season of 1990.  Although it is not known why the artificial environment of the tailings ponds was so attractive for the savanna species the events clearly demonstrated that savanna flies seasonally invading the area, possibly aided by the northeasterly harmattan winds, can become established in the rain forest zone if suitable conditions are met.  No infections with Onchocerca volvulus were found in more than 1000 flies caught by vector collectors but, after experimental infection with the local forest strain, a few parasites developed to the infective stage.  As yet there is no evidence that the occurrence of savanna flies in the rain forest zone of Liberia was of epidemiological significance.

TI  - Pleistocene aridification underlies the evolutionary history of the Caribbean endemic, insular, giant <i>Consolea</i> (Opuntioideae)
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
AB  - Premise The Caribbean islands are in the top five biodiversity hotspots on the planet; however, the biogeographic history of the seasonally dry tropical forest (SDTF) there is poorly studied. Consolea consists of nine species of dioecious, hummingbird-pollinated tree cacti endemic to the West Indies, which form a conspicuous element of the SDTF. Several species are threatened by anthropogenic disturbance, disease, sea-level rise, and invasive species and are of conservation concern. However, no comprehensive phylogeny yet exists for the clade.
   Methods We reconstructed the phylogeny of Consolea, sampling all species using plastomic data to determine relationships, understand the evolution of key morphological characters, and test their biogeographic history. We estimated divergence times to determine the role climate change may have played in shaping the current diversity of the clade.
   Results Consolea appears to have evolved very recently during the latter part of the Pleistocene on Cuba/Hispaniola likely from a South American ancestor and, from there, moved into the Bahamas, Jamaica, Puerto Rico, Florida, and the Lesser Antilles. The tree growth form is a synapomorphy of Consolea and likely aided in the establishment and diversification of the clade.
   Conclusions Pleistocene aridification associated with glaciation likely played a role in shaping the current diversity of Consolea, and insular gigantism may have been a key innovation leading to the success of these species to invade the often-dense SDTF. This in-situ Caribbean radiation provides a window into the generation of species diversity and the complexity of the SDTF community within the Antilles.

TI  - Temporal variation in diversity and community structure of preimaginal blackflies (Diptera: Simuliidae) in a tropical forest reserve in Malaysia
T2  - ACTA TROPICA
AB  - Blackflies (Diptera: Simuliidae) are ecologically and medically important insects but they have been understudied in Malaysia. Accordingly, a study on the temporal variation in diversity and community structure of preimaginal blackflies was conducted for the first time in Malaysia. A total of 865 preimaginal blackflies were collected in 120 samplings from five streams across three monsoon seasons from February 2018 until January 2019. Ten species were recorded and most frequently collected species were Simulium cheongi, Simulium vanluni and Simulium jeffreyi. Relatively common species were Simulium roslihashimi, Simulium tani complex and Simulium trangense. No significant changes of rainfall was observed between three monsoon seasons as well as the seasons with species and physiochemical parameters except acidity (pH) (P < 0.01). Species relative abundance was varied between seasons, as high value of Shannon index (H) was found in northeast monsoon and lowest in the southwest monsoon. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of all stream variables revealed two PCs that accounted for 61.4% of the total variance of physicochemical characteristics. Regression analysis revealed that species richness was positively and significantly associated with wider, deeper, faster, low conductivity and larger streambed particle with less canopy cover. Forward logistic regression analysis on three frequently collected species (>20%) indicated that S. vanluni and S. jeffreyi were commonly associated with wider, deeper and fast-flowing streams with low conductivity and larger streambed particle. In contrast, S. cheongi was associated with smaller, slower and small streambed particle. This first extensive bimonthly study has uncovered the species community structure as well as the changes of stream physicochemical parameters over time although they were not greatly and significantly influenced by the monsoon seasons. Species distribution, richness and abundance, however, were highly determined by the stream width, depth and velocity, therefore, were vital in shaping diversity and community structure of preimaginal blackflies.

TI  - Whole-Genome Resequencing Reveals Selection Signatures of Abigar Cattle for Local Adaptation
T2  - ANIMALS
AB  - Simple Summary Abigar cattle, native to southwestern Ethiopia's hot and humid environment, are recognized for their adaptability and vital contribution to local livelihoods and the livestock value chain. Investigating their genetic basis for adaptive traits is crucial for sustainable use. However, there is a paucity of studies on genomic diversity, population structure, and selection signatures of Abigar cattle. This study introduces the first whole-genome sequencing of Abigar cattle, revealing genes linked to heat tolerance, immune response, and stress resilience in tropical conditions. These findings offer essential genomic insights for future Abigar cattle breeding.Abstract Over time, indigenous cattle breeds have developed disease resistance, heat tolerance, and adaptability to harsh environments. Deciphering the genetic mechanisms underlying adaptive traits is crucial for their improvement and sustainable utilization. For the first time, we performed whole-genome sequencing to unveil the genomic diversity, population structure, and selection signatures of Abigar cattle living in a tropical environment. The population structure analysis revealed that Abigar cattle exhibit high nucleotide diversity and heterozygosity, with low runs of homozygosity and linkage disequilibrium, suggesting a genetic landscape less constrained by inbreeding and enriched by diversity. Using nucleotide diversity (Pi) and population differentiation (FST) selection scan methods, we identified 83 shared genes that are likely associated with tropical adaption. The functional annotation analysis revealed that some of these genes are potentially linked to heat tolerance (HOXC13, DNAJC18, and RXFP2), immune response (IRAK3, MZB1, and STING1), and oxidative stress response (SLC23A1). Given the wider spreading impacts of climate change on cattle production, understanding the genetic mechanisms of adaptation of local breeds becomes crucial to better respond to climate and environmental changes. In this context, our finding establishes a foundation for further research into the mechanisms underpinning cattle adaptation to tropical environments.

TI  - Aquaculture induced erosion of tropical coastlines throws coastal communities back into poverty
T2  - OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - Shallow tropical coastlines harbour unique mangrove ecosystems, which support livelihoods and provide a natural barrier against coastal flooding. Non-sustainable land-use practices, such as large-scale clear cutting of mangroves for aquaculture, ground water withdrawal and alteration of river flows, result in rapid subsidence. The collapse of aquaculture production, due to pollution and disease, is followed by coastal erosion, damage to infrastructure, intrusion of salt water and coastal flooding. Standard engineered interventions for protection often fail or are extremely expensive in these soft muddy environments. Subsidence and erosion render re-planting of mangroves in front of retreating coastlines impossible. Short-term solutions should focus on restoration of abiotic conditions, such as hydrology and sediment fluxes, to facilitate rapid establishment of protective mangrove belts. However, to ensure long-term sustainability, improved governance frameworks are required that put in place criteria for sustainable aquaculture, guide coastal infrastructure designs and limit ground water extraction.

TI  - Medium- and long-term conservation and safe international exchange of germplasm from food and cash tropical crops
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 4TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON IN VITRO CULTURE AND HORTICULTURAL BREEDING
CP  - 4th International Symposium on In Vitro Culture and Horticultural Breeding
AB  - In this review, five plants studied in IRD were taken into account. Some belongs to food crops (cassava, yam), or cash crops (coffee, oil palm), or to both (coconut). To facilitate the safe international exchange of these categories of tropical crops, development of in vitro facilities allows conservation of germplasm, disease and virus-free, for medium-term or long-term duration. Slow growth is feasible, in routine application, on coffee, cassava and yam. Most of the different tropical crops did not allow conventional seed storage strategies. Some have recalcitrant seeds with no dormancy (coconut), others tolerate desiccation but not low temperature (coffee, oil palm), others are species propagated vegetatively (cassava, yam). Cryopreservation success depends of the techniques adapted according to the organ and the plant concerned: encapsulation/dehydration with caulinary meristem (coffee, cassava, yam, coconut), vitrification with shoot-tip (cassava, yam), desiccation and precooling with somatic (oil palm), zygotic embryo (coffee, coconut, oil palm) and desiccated seed (coffee) or desiccated kernel (oil palm). In vitro plant material is the safest way for international exchange. It is carried out: 1) routinely on cassava (in vitro plantlets) and yam (in vitro plantlets, microtuberization, encapsulated apices), on coconut (zygotic embryos), 2) occasionally, on oil palm (somatic embryos, in vitro plantlets), on coffee (in vitro plantlets, cryopreserved seeds).

TI  - High levels of infectiousness of asymptomatic Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis infections in wild rodents highlights their importance in the epidemiology of American Tegumentary Leishmaniasis in Brazil
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - BackgroundThe epidemiological significance of wildlife infections with aetiological agents causing human infectious diseases is largely determined by their infection status, contact potential with humans (via vectors for vector-borne diseases), and their infectiousness to maintain onward transmission. This study quantified these parameters in wild and synanthropic naturally infected rodent populations in an endemic region of tegumentary leishmaniasis in northeast Brazil. MethodsCapture-mark-recapture (CMR) of rodents was conducted over 27 months in domestic/peri domestic environs, household plantations and nearby Atlantic Forest (9,920 single trap nights). Rodent clinical samples (blood and ear tissue) were tested for infection by conventional PCR and quantitative PCR (qPCR) for L. (Viannia) braziliensis, and xenodiagnosis to measure infectiousness to the local sand fly vector. ResultsA total 603 individuals of 8 rodent species were (re)captured on 1,051 occasions. The most abundant species were Nectomys squamipes (245 individuals, 41% of the total catch), Rattus rattus (148, 25%), and Necromys lasiurus (83, 14%). All species were captured in greater relative frequencies in plantations; R. rattus was the only species captured in all three habitats including in and around houses. Four species, comprising 22.6% of individuals captured at least twice, were geolocated in more than one habitat type; 78.6% were infected with L. (V.) braziliensis, facilitating inter-species and inter-habitat transmission. Species specific period prevalence ranged between 0%-62% being significantly higher in N. squamipes (54-62%) and H. sciureus (43-47%). Xenodiagnosis was performed on 41 occasions exposing 1,879 Nyssomyia whitmani sand flies to five rodent species (37 individuals). Similar mean levels of infectiousness amongst the more common rodent species were observed. Longitudinal xenodiagnosis of the N. squamipes population revealed a persistent level of infectiousness over 13 months follow-up, infecting a median 48% (IQR: 30.1%-64.2%) of exposed blood-fed vectors. The proportion of exposed flies infected was greater in the low comparted to in the high seasonal period of vector abundance. L. (V.) braziliensis parasite loads in rodent blood quantified by qPCR were similar across rodent species but did not represent a reliable quantitative marker of infectiousness to sand flies. The standardised risk of rodent infection in plantations was 70.3% relative to 11.3% and 18.4% in peri domestic and forest habitats respectively. R. rattus was the only exception to this trend indicating greatest risk in the peri domestic environment. ConclusionsThe results support the view that a collective assemblage of wild and synanthropic rodent species is an important wild reservoir of L. (V.) braziliensis in this region, with N. squamipes and R. rattus probably playing a key role in transmission within and between habitat types and rodent species. Rodents, and by implication humans, are at risk of infection in all sampled habitats, but more so in homestead plantations. These conclusions are based on one of the longest CMR study of small rodents in an American Tegumentary Leishmaniasis (ATL) foci.
   Author summaryOur previous studies on the prevalence of leishmanial infections in wild caught rodents suggested that they represent potential reservoirs of Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis in northeast Brazil, supported by showing that laboratory bred rodents that were experimentally infected with L. (V.) braziliensis were infectious to Lutzomyia longipalpis. The present field study reports the abundance of rodent species in different ecotopes, the prevalence of Leishmania infections in a cohort of naturally infected rodent species and the transmission potential of the most abundant species by xenodiagnoses using the primary vector, Ny. whitmani. The results incriminate the local guild of rodents as a collective wildlife reservoir in the zoonotic transmission cycle of L. (V.) braziliensis. The greatest infection risk to rodents, and likely also to humans, is in peri domestic plantations, where N. squamipes, Ne. lasiurus and R. rattus, in particular, occur at high densities; the former species supported the highest infection prevalences and were infectious for extended periods. R. rattus was the only species captured supporting infections in and around households in addition to the other habitats. More than 20% of rodents captured at least twice moved between habitat types. There was a qualitative but not quantitative relationship between L. (V.) braziliensis parasite loads in rodent blood samples and xenopositive sand flies.

TI  - Modelling the potential distribution of arbovirus vector <i>Aedes aegypti</i> under current and future climate scenarios in Taiwan, China
T2  - PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE
AB  - BACKGROUND Aedes aegypti is one of the most important mosquito species and is a common disease-transmitting pest in tropical areas. Various infectious arbovirus diseases can be transmitted by Ae. aegypti. With ongoing global climate change, we are facing an increasing public health threat from the rapid spread of disease vectors into wider geographical areas. To better understand the current ecological niche range and possible future expansion of Ae. aegypti, an ecological niche modelling approach was adopted to predict its current and future potential habitat in Taiwan, China. RESULTS Based on observed occurrence records and environmental layers reflecting climate and land-use conditions, predictions with a high resolution of 30 arcsec (approx. 1 x 1 km) were made by our model. Ae. aegypti was predicted to expand its habitat in varying degrees out of its current niche range under different climate scenarios for the future 21st century. Winter temperature and dry season precipitation were considered as important predictors among climate variables. Croplands, pasture, forested lands and urban lands were important land-use variables. CONCLUSION Ae. aegypti is expected to establish new habitats out of its current niche range under the trend of global climate change. The extent of habitat expansion varies under different climate scenarios. Appropriate measures should be taken to prevent its expansion to a broader scale. Our study has important strategic implications for mosquito surveillance and the prevention and control of mosquito-borne diseases. (c) 2019 Society of Chemical Industry

TI  - The Risk of Disease to Great Apes: Simulating Disease Spread in Orang-Utan (<i>Pongo pygmaeus</i> <i>wurmbii</i>) and Chimpanzee (<i>Pan</i> <i>troglodytes schweinfurthii</i>) Association Networks
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - All great ape species are endangered, and infectious diseases are thought to pose a particular threat to their survival. As great ape species vary substantially in social organisation and gregariousness, there are likely to be differences in susceptibility to disease types and spread. Understanding the relation between social variables and disease is therefore crucial for implementing effective conservation measures. Here, we simulate the transmission of a range of diseases in a population of orang-utans in Sabangau Forest (Central Kalimantan) and a community of chimpanzees in Budongo Forest (Uganda), by systematically varying transmission likelihood and probability of subsequent recovery. Both species have fission-fusion social systems, but differ considerably in their level of gregariousness. We used long-term behavioural data to create networks of association patterns on which the spread of different diseases was simulated. We found that chimpanzees were generally far more susceptible to the spread of diseases than orang-utans. When simulating different diseases that varied widely in their probability of transmission and recovery, it was found that the chimpanzee community was widely and strongly affected, while in orang-utans even highly infectious diseases had limited spread. Furthermore, when comparing the observed association network with a mean-field network (equal contact probability between group members), we found no major difference in simulated disease spread, suggesting that patterns of social bonding in orangutans are not an important determinant of susceptibility to disease. In chimpanzees, the predicted size of the epidemic was smaller on the actual association network than on the mean-field network, indicating that patterns of social bonding have important effects on susceptibility to disease. We conclude that social networks are a potentially powerful tool to model the risk of disease transmission in great apes, and that chimpanzees are particularly threatened by infectious disease outbreaks as a result of their social structure.

TI  - Ownership and utilization of bed nets and reasons for use or non-use of bed nets among community members at risk of malaria along the Thai-Myanmar border
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
AB  - Background With the goal for malaria elimination in Thailand set for 2024, increased coverage and utilization of bed net, especially insecticide-treated net (ITN) or long-lasting insecticidal net (LLIN) is a key strategy. This study aims to provide the necessary information about bed net ownership and utilization among the population at risk of malaria living along the Thai-Myanmar border in Tak province. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted using a mixed-method approach in 331 households from 5 hamlets in the villages of the Thai-Myanmar border. The research tools included a questionnaire, bed net inspection, and semi-structured interviews. Logistic regression was used to explore the sociodemographic factors associated with bed net utilization. The qualitative analysis employed a thematic analysis approach. Results This survey found that 98.5% of households had at least one bed net per household, and 74.3% had at least one ITN/LLIN. However, only 30.8% of households reached the standard policy set by the Minister of Public Health of one ITN/LLINs per two persons. Most residents used bed net (92.1% used in the previous night and 80.9% used every day). For those using bed nets, however, 61.9% used ITNs or LLINs the night before and 53.1% used them every day. Nonetheless, the usage rates of bed nets (any type) in the previous night among children and pregnant women were high, reaching 95.3% and 90.0%, respectively. Seven explanatory variables showed statistically significant associations with bed net use every day, including: "not staying overnight in the forest or the field", "sleeping pattern based on gender", "sufficient numbers of bed nets to cover all sleeping spaces", "preference for free bed nets", "age", "gender", and "SES score" showed statistically significant association with bed net use every day. The major reasons for the regular use of bed nets in both household and the forest were to prevent mosquito biting. The reasons for not using bednets in the household were discomfort feelings from heat, perception of unnecessity due to low mosquito density, whereas the reason for not using bed nets in the forest was inconvenience. Conclusion Despite that overall coverage and usage of bed nets was high, only one third reached the standard level specified by the policy. Overnight in the forest, the dissatisfaction with the quality of free bed nets, insufficient number of bed nets, sleeping alone, male gender, age more than 10 years, low socioeconomic status, discomfort from heat, perception of no benefits of bed nets due to low mosquito density, and inconvenience were factors influencing bed net use. Maintaining high coverage and utility rate of bed nets should be a priority for the malaria high-risk population.

TI  - Challenges to the Fight against Rabies-The Landscape of Policy and Prevention Strategies in Africa
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Nearly 59,000 human deaths worldwide are attributable to rabies annually, of which more than a third occur in Africa. In recent years, progress has been made in both action and collaboration including implementation of surveillance and prevention measures. In this review we assess the scale of surveillance, preventive, and control efforts of canine-transmitted human rabies in African countries. We reviewed literature published from 2014 to 2018, retrieved from electronic databases including MEDLINE, Global Index Medicus, BIOSIS, Science Citation Index, and EMBASE. WHO reports, national disease control program reports, and conference proceedings were also reviewed. The database search was conducted using keywords including rabies, control, and prevention. In forty countries (40/54), some level of rabies control and prevention strategy was available while in fourteen (14/54) countries, no specific national control and prevention strategy for human rabies could be retrieved. Thirty-four (34/54) countries utilized the Stepwise Approach towards Rabies Elimination (SARE) tool to monitor the national rabies control efforts-five of these countries were at the lowest tier (0/5) of the SARE scoring system while no country had achieved the highest score (5/5). High burden countries need to step up the implementation of context specific national rabies control, prevention, and monitoring strategies. As a zoonosis, rabies control and elimination require coordination between human and veterinarian health sectors under the "One Health" umbrella and with national master plans on the prevention and control of neglected tropical diseases ending in 2020, the time to act is now.

TI  - Molecular Characterization of <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> Complex Isolated from Free-Ranging Long-Tailed Macaques at Kosumpee Forest Park, Maha Sarakham, Thailand
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE
AB  - The Staphylococcus (S.) aureus complex, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), and S. argenteus are bacterial pathogens that are responsible for both human and animal infection. However, insights into the molecular characteristics of MRSA, MSSA, and S. argenteus carriages in wildlife, especially in long-tailed macaques, rarely have been reported in Thailand. The objective of this study was to assess molecular characterization of MRSA, MSSA, and S. argenteus strains isolated from free-ranging long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis) at Kosumpee Forest Park, Maha Sarakham, Thailand. A total of 21 secondary bacterial isolates (including 14 MRSA, 5 MSSA, and 2 S. argenteus) obtained from the buccal mucosa of 17 macaques were analysed by a Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to identify several virulence genes, including pvl, tst, hla, hlb clfA, spa (x-region), spa (IgG biding region), and coa. The most prevalent virulence genes were clfA, coa, and the spa IgG biding region which presented in all isolates. These data indicated that MRSA, MSSA, and S. argenteus isolates from the wild macaques at Kosumpee Forest Park possess a unique molecular profile, harbouring high numbers of virulence genes. These findings suggest that wild macaques may potentially serve as carriers for distribution of virulent staphylococcal bacteria in the study area.

TI  - Traditional uses of under-utilized tree species in sub tropical rainfed areas of Kathua, Jammu & Kashmir
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE
AB  - Present investigation was carried out in three blocks; Hiranagar, Dinga Amb and Marheen of Kathua district of Jammu region of Jammu and Kashmir located in the sub-tropical zone to identify and document the under-utilized forest tree species and their multiple traditional uses. Study revealed that people in the study area make multiple traditional uses of eight tree species which are ordinarily considered under-utilized, viz. Aegle marmelos L., Carissa spinarum L.; Cordia dichotoma var. wallichii, Ficus palmata Forsk. syn. F. virgata, Ficus roxburghii Wall.; Flacourtia indica (Burm.f.) Merr; Terminalia belerica Gaertn. Roxb. These tree species have been reported to have different uses as food, fodder, fuel, fencing, medicinal and in ethno-veterinary. Stem, bark, leaves; roots as well as fruits have been reported to have important traditional uses. Diverse medicinal properties of these tree species to overcome different problems/diseases like sun stroke, dysentery, pneumonia, cough, chest complaints, sour throat, toothache, mouth ulcers, inflammations, healing, anemia, curing urinary problems, and leucoderma have also been reported. Foliage of some identified under-utilized trees is used as vegetable and fruits and roots for making pickle. These are also used for the treatment of intestinal disorders, anoestrus and as appetizer in cattle. Wood of many under-utilized tree species is preferred for making handles of implements, panjali used in animal driven ploughs and aarlia of animal driven plough. Frequent cutting of these trees has been matter of serious concern.

TI  - Phytogeography and organization of genetic diversity in the genus Passiflora
T2  - TROPICAL PHYOTOGEOGRAPHY: REALITIES AND PERSPECTIVES
CP  - International Colloquium on Tropical Phytogeography, Dedicated to Raymond Schnell
AB  - The genus Passiflora comprises 450 to 500 species of herbaceous and woody lianas most of which occur in tropical forest of America, few species were collected in Asia, Australia and in West Pacific islands.
   The most important center of diversity of the genus, with about 150 species collected, is in the cloud forest of Andean cordilleras. Another center of diversity, with about a hundred species collected, is in the high and lower cloud forest of Central America and West Indies. About 80 species were collected in Guianese and in Brazilian Shields, about twenty species are widespread in tropical America.
   In America the centers of diversity are located in mountain forests where rainfall is particularly high, these areas would be forest refugia and also refugia for Heliconius or passion flower butterflies, example of coevolution between insects and plants.
   In Guianas one refugium would be locate in the northeasthern part of French Guiana, in Kaw mountain region. This area is a center of endemism for Passiflora, the botanical explorations permit to collect about twenty species belonging to six different subgenera.
   The study of characters to four of these subgenera (Astrophea, Distephana, Passiflora and Plectostemma), concerning phytogeography, foliar forms, vegetative architecture and resistance to disease, allows to estimate the evolutive connections of species groups.
   The biodiversity study of Guianan passion flowers permitted to determine genetic resources of these plants interesting the improvement of passion fruit culture, widespread in tropical regions of the world.

TI  - Ectoparasite fauna of rodents and shrews from four habitats in Kuala Lumpur and the states of Selangor and Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia and its public health significance
T2  - TROPICAL BIOMEDICINE
AB  - A total of 204 rodents comprising 14 host. species from four different habitats were examined. Nine rodent species were trapped from the forest and another five species were trapped from the coastal, rice field taut urban habitats. Rattus rattus diardii (67%) was the predominant rodent species examined. Fifty six (47.3%) rodents and shrews were found to toe infested with at least one of the 20 species of ectoparasite recovered. Mites belonging to the family Trombiculidae were the predominant ectoparasite species recovered. Ticks belonging to the family Ixodidae were recovered mainly from the forest: dwelling rodents. Polyplax spinulosa and Hoplopleura pacifica were the common lice species found infesting the urban rodents. Xenopsylla cheopis was the only flea species recovered. The following ecto-parasites have been incriminated as important vectors or as mechanical carriers for the transmission of zoonotic diseases: Ixodes granulatus, Dermacentor sp. Haemaphysalis sp., Amblyomma sp. Ascoschoengastia indica, Leptotrombidium deliense, Ornithonyssus bacoti, Laelaps nuttalli, H. pacifica, P. spinulosa and Xenopsylla cheopsis. Urban and forest rodents were significantly higher in ecto-parasitic infestation, compared to rats from the other two habitats. However, there was no significant; statistical association between nude and female rodents infested with ectoparasites.

TI  - Genetic structure of introduced swamp buffalo subpopulations in tropical Australia
T2  - AUSTRAL ECOLOGY
AB  - High densities of introduced herbivores can damage sensitive ecosystems, increase the risk of extinction of native biota, and host and spread disease. An essential step in managing large feral animal populations is to quantify how they use habitats so that management interventions, such as culling, can be targeted to reduce densities and to minimize migration into areas from which animals have been removed. An effective method to quantify animal movements is by measuring landscape-scale genetic population structure. We describe the genetic population structure of one of Australia's more destructive introduced mammals the Asian swamp buffalo (Bubalus bubalis). We collected 524 skin samples from buffalo across their range in the Northern Territory of Australia. Allelic diversity in the Northern Territory population was low compared to those reported from populations in their native Asian habitats. The Australian population is tentatively made of three subpopulations; Melville Island, Eastern Arnhem and Central-Western Arnhem populations. The Melville Island population is represented by a single cluster, while the Eastern Arnhem population has three clusters and the Central-Western Arnhem population seven clusters. We found some support for isolation by distance across all the sampled populations, but little evidence for this relationship when comparing the two well-mixed mainland meta-populations. Despite their small founder populations and limited genetic variation, the persistence of buffalo in Australia has likely been aided by release from high predation, parasitism and disease typical of their native habitats.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variations and potential influencing factors of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome: A case study in Weihe Basin, China
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - BackgroundHemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is a widespread zoonotic disease seriously threatening Chinese residents' health. HFRS of Weihe Basin remains highly prevalent in recent years and attracts wide attention. With the acceleration of urbanization and related environmental changes, the interaction among anthropogenic activities, environmental factors, and host animals becomes more complicated in this area, which posed increasingly complex challenges for implementing effective prevention measures. Identifying the potential influencing factors of continuous HFRS epidemics in this typical area is critical to make targeted prevention and control strategies. MethodsSpatiotemporal characteristics of HFRS epidemic were analyzed based on HFRS case point data in Weihe Basin from 2005 to 2020. MaxEnt models were constructed to explore the main influencing factors of HFRS epidemic based on HFRS data, natural environment factors and socioeconomic factors. ResultsResults showed that the HFRS epidemics in Weihe Basin were temporally divided into three periods (the relatively stable period, the rapid rising period, and the fluctuating rising period) and were spatially featured by relatively concentrated in the plains alongside the Weihe River. Landscape played controlling effect in this area while land use, vegetation and population in the area interacted with each other and drove the change of HFRS epidemic. The potential high-risk area for HFRS epidemic was 419 km(2), where the HFRS case density reached 12.48 cases/km(2), especially in the northern plains of Xi'an City. ConclusionWe suggested that the temporal and spatial variations in the HFRS epidemics, as well as their dominant influencing factors should be adequately considered for making and/or adjusting the targeted prevention and control strategies on this disease in Weihe Basin.
   Author summaryIn recent years, the incidence rate of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) has declined in most area of China, although the acceleration of urbanization caused increasingly complicated interactions among anthropogenic activities, environmental factors, and host animals during the past decades. However, there were still some typical regions with serious HFRS epidemics in this country like the Weihe Basin in Shaanxi Province, in which more efforts should be paid for identifying the potential influencing factors and their driving mechanisms. Our study employed the MaxEnt modeling to reveal the spatio-temporal variations in the influencing factors on the epidemics of this disease from 2005 to 2020 in the Weihe Basin. We found that the landscape played controlling effect in this area while land use, vegetation and population in the area interacted with each other and drove the change of HFRS epidemic. The underling influencing factors and the stimulation of HFRS epidemic would provide detailed information for targeted strategy formulation, and the also provide reference for similar studies.

TI  - Sustainable management of<i> Eucalyptus</i><i> pellita</i> plantations: A review
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - This paper reviews current knowledge of Eucalyptus pellita plantations to identify management practices for optimizing productivity and maintaining sustainability in the equatorial and tropical environments where it is grown. A combination of genetic improvement and silvicultural practices have markedly improved E. pellita productivity in recent decades. The productivity of E. pellita plantations around the world ranges from 9.4 to 34.9 m3/ha/year, with a tendency to be more productive in regions that receive higher annual rainfall. Because responses vary on water-limited sites, site-specific management practices such as the planting of superior hybrids and clones, and stocking management, are important for optimizing E. pellita growth. We identified several research gaps in understanding the impact of E. pellita harvest residue management on tree growth, benefits of intercropping E. pellita with N-fixing species, the capability and required management of E. pellita coppices to develop new rotation, and E. pellita water use and water requirements. The uncertain taxonomic status of E. pellita is also noted - with the possibility that E. biterranea is a separate species in the more continuously warm and wet equatorial far northern Queensland and Papua/Papua New Guinea geographic range of E. pellita. This may have implications for the continuous development of genetic material for the range of environments currently planted with E. pellita - and for understanding the potential impacts of climate change on productivity, and pest and disease resistance.

TI  - Seroprevalence of Rift Valley fever in cattle of smallholder farmers in Kwilu Province in the Democratic Republic of Congo
T2  - TROPICAL ANIMAL HEALTH AND PRODUCTION
AB  - Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a zoonotic mosquito-borne disease caused by RVF virus (RVFV) that causes abortions and high mortalities in livestock and is also associated with acute and fatal disease in humans. In the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), information on the epidemiology of RVF is limited, particularly among cattle reared by smallholder farmers. This cross-sectional study was conducted to investigate the seroprevalence of RVF in cattle raised by smallholder farmers in Kwilu Province of DRC, which has not yet reported an RVF epidemic. A total of 677 cattle sera were collected from four territories and tested for anti-RVFV antibodies using immunofluorescent assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The overall seroprevalence of anti-RVFV IgG was 6.5% (44/677) (95% CI 4.81-8.7). There was a statistically significant difference in the seroprevalence among the territories (chi (2)=28.79, p<0.001). Territory seroprevalences were as follows: Idiofa 14.08% (95% CI 9.78-19.76), Bulungu 4.14% (95% CI 1.83-8.68), Gungu 3.21% (95% CI 1.41-6.78), and Masi-Manimba 1.19% (95% CI 0.06-7.37). Seroprevalence differed significantly among age categories (p=0.0017) and ecosystem (p<0.001). The seroprevalence of animals aged between 1 and 2 years was 20.0% (95% CI 8.4-39.13) and was higher than group aged <1 year, between 2 and 3 years, and >3 years. Forest area (18.92% (95% CI 12.35-27.7)) had higher seropositivity than savannah area (4.06% (95% CI 2.65-6.12)). Sex difference was not significant (chi (2)=0.14, p=0.704). These findings indicate that cattle in Kwilu Province had been exposed to RVFV, which represents a significant risk for both livestock and human health.

TI  - Long-term study of neighbour-regulated demography during a decline in forest species diversity
T2  - JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE
AB  - Question: Did disturbance, no density-dependence of the dominant species, and negative neighbourhood interactions on rare species affect tree demography during a decline in species diversity associated with the increase of Acer saccharum from 1939-2001 ?
   Hypotheses: 1. The rise in dominance of A. saccharum was because of its advantage in disturbances and lack of density-dependence of its demography. 2. Rare species were not favoured by disturbances, including those from Dutch elm disease, and demonstrated negative neighbourhood interactions with A. saccharum.
   Location: Brownfield Woods in Illinois, USA.
   Methods: Historical maps of trees (>= 7.6 cm DBH) from 1939,1951,1988, and 2001 in 16 quadrats (48 m x 68 m) were used to compare demography of eight tree species. Effects of disturbances, density-dependence, and neighbourhood interactions on mortality and recruitment of tree species within a 6-m radius of individual target trees were studied.
   Results: A. saccharum demonstrated a demographic advantage over rare species. It had lower mortality and higher recruitment rates. Disturbances facilitated recruitment of A. saccharum, but did not enhance rare species. Density-dependence of both mortality and recruitment of A. saccharum occurred, but population projection models indicated that ecological conditions became more favourable for A. saccharum in the past 62 years. Furthermore, negative neighbourhood interactions were detected between rare species and A. saccharum. The increase in neighbouring A. saccharum significantly increased mortality and reduced recruitment of the rare species.
   Conclusions: The general disturbance regime, enhanced by Dutch elm disease, in Brownfield Woods facilitated the rise of dominance of A. saccharum. Meanwhile, rare species declined as a result of their disadvantage in disturbance and negative neighbourhood interactions with A. saccharum.

TI  - Medicinal uses of <i>Moringa oleifera</i> in southern Benin (West Africa)
T2  - I INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON MORINGA
CP  - 1st International Symposium on Moringa
AB  - Moringa oleifera is a non-tree forest product (NTFP) known for its nutritional and medicinal virtues. The present study investigated the medicinal uses of various parts of Moringa oleifera in southern Benin. An ethnobotanical survey was carried out across the four phyto-districts of southern Benin (Plateau, Coast, Oueme and Pobe) with a sample of 439 informants (201 women and 238 men) belonging to Fon, Waci, Xwla, Sahoue, Djerma, Kotafon, Aizo, Goun, Yoruba socio-cultural groups. The informants include traditional medicine practitioners, householder, housewives, old men and women, adults, and the young. Various parts of Moringa oleifera are used to obtain traditional medicines to cure diseases. The study revealed up to 46 complete recipes traditionally made to heal 34 common diseases. These include venereal diseases, cardiovascular diseases, infectious diseases, tropical diseases, inflammatory complaints, oto-rhino-laryngologocal complaints, skin infections, digestive diseases, infertility disorders, etc. The mode of administration as well as the dosage of each medicine were recorded. It was found that among the plant parts used for this purpose, the leaf was the most used, followed by the roots, bark, seeds and pods. The consensual value of use types was estimated to prove the relative efficiency of each medicine. Moreover, the seeds were also found to be used to carry out rites for blessings and attracting customers and a sexual partner. The study showed that M. oleifera plays an important role in traditional medicine in the rural areas of South Benin, hence this study constitutes sound arguments for its production at large scale in agroforestry systems in Benin. The information collected is useful and can nurture more in-depth research on the part of modern medicine for better use of this species.

TI  - Dynamics of Sylvatic Chagas Disease Vectors in Coastal Ecuador Is Driven by Changes in Land Cover
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background: Chagas disease is a serious public health problem in Latin America where about ten million individuals show Trypanosoma cruzi infection. Despite significant success in controlling domiciliated triatomines, sylvatic populations frequently infest houses after insecticide treatment which hampers long term control prospects in vast geographical areas where vectorial transmission is endemic. As a key issue, the spatio-temporal dynamics of sylvatic populations is likely influenced by landscape yet evidence showing this effect is rare. The aim of this work is to examine the role of land cover changes in sylvatic triatomine ecology, based on an exhaustive field survey of pathogens, vectors, hosts, and microhabitat characteristics' dynamics.
   Methodology and Principal Findings: The study was performed in agricultural landscapes of coastal Ecuador as a study model. Over one year, a spatially-randomized sampling design (490 collection points) allowed quantifying triatomine densities in natural, cultivated and domestic habitats. We also assessed infection of the bugs with trypanosomes, documented their microhabitats and potential hosts, and recorded changes in landscape characteristics. In total we collected 886 individuals, mainly represented by nymphal stages of one triatomine species Rhodnius ecuadoriensis. As main results, we found that 1) sylvatic triatomines had very high T. cruzi infection rates (71%) and 2) densities of T. cruzi-infected sylvatic triatomines varied predictably over time due to changes in land cover and occurrence of associated rodent hosts.
   Conclusion: We propose a framework for identifying the factors affecting the yearly distribution of sylvatic T. cruzi vectors. Beyond providing key basic information for the control of human habitat colonization by sylvatic vector populations, our framework highlights the importance of both environmental and sociological factors in shaping the spatio-temporal population dynamics of triatomines. A better understanding of the dynamics of such socio-ecological systems is a crucial, yet poorly considered, issue for the long-term control of Chagas disease.

TI  - Malaria and environmental, socioeconomics and public health conditions in the municipality of S?o F?lix do Xingu, Par?, Eastern Amazon, Brazil: An ecological and cross-sectional study
T2  - REVISTA DA SOCIEDADE BRASILEIRA DE MEDICINA TROPICAL
AB  - Background: Malaria is a parasitosis conditioned by several factors. This study sought to analyze the spatial distribution of malaria considering environmental, socioeconomic, and political variables in Sao Felix do Xingu, Para, Brazil, from 2014 to 2020. Methods: Epidemiological, cartographic, and environmental data were obtained from the Ministry of Health, Brazilian Geographical and Statistical Institute, and National Space Research Institute. Statistical and spatial distribution analyses were performed using chi-squared tests of expected equal proportions and the kernel and bivariate global Moran's techniques with Bioestat 5.0 and ArcGIS 10.5.1. Results: The highest percentage of cases occurred in adult males with brown skin color, mainly placer miners, with a primary education level, living in rural areas, who were infected with Plasmodium vivax and with parasitemia of two or three crosses as diagnosed by the thick drop/smear test. The disease had a non-homogeneous distribution, with distinct annual parasite indices associated with administrative districts and clusters of cases in locations with deforestation, mining, and pastures close to Conservation Units and Indigenous Lands. Thus, a direct relationship between areas with cases and environmental degradation associated with land use was demonstrated, along with the precarious availability of health services. Pressure on protected areas and epidemiological silence in Indigenous Lands were also noted. Conclusions: Environmental and socioeconomic circuits were identified for development of diseases associated with precarious health services in the municipality. These findings highlight the need to intensify malaria surveillance and contribute to the systematic knowledge of malaria's epidemiology by considering the complexity of its conditioning factors.

TI  - Effects of local biotic neighbors and habitat heterogeneity on seedling survival in a spruce-fir valley forest, northeastern China
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB  - Seedlings are vulnerable to many biotic and abiotic agents, and studying seedling dynamics helps understand mechanisms of species coexistence. In this study, the relative importance of biotic neighbors and habitat heterogeneity to seedling survival was examined by generalized linear mixed models for 33 species in a spruce-fir valley forest in northeastern China. The results showed that the relative importance of these factors varied with species and functional groups. Conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD) was important to the survival of Abies nephrolepis and Picea koraiensis seedling, whereas phylogenetic negative density dependence (PNDD) was critical to Pinus koraiensis and Betula platyphylla, as well as functional groups of tree, deciduous, and shade-intolerant seedlings. For shrubs and Acer ukurunduense, habitat heterogeneity was significant. Despite of the significance of CNDD, PNDD, and habitat heterogeneity on seedling survival, large proportions of the total variance were not accounted for by the studied variables, suggesting the needs to examine the influences of other factors such as pests, diseases, herbivores, forest structure, species functional traits, and microclimatic conditions on seedling survival in the future.

TI  - Genetic tolerance to Ceratocystis wilt in melina (<i>Gmelina arborea</i> Roxb.)
T2  - SILVAE GENETICA
AB  - Gmelina arborea is the second most planted tree species in Costa Rica, and one of the most important in several Latin American countries. In recent years, a disease caused by Ceratocystis fimbriata, has spread throughout Latin America, leading to the complete root of the tree in a few months. This study was conducted to evaluate the incidence, severity and genetic tolerance control of the Ceratocystis wilt in G. arborea. Data is based on a 2.4-year-old clonal trial, with 34 elite genotypes, at Rio Jimenez, Guacimo in the Costa Rican Caribbean region. The variables diameter at breast height (DBH), total height, disease incidence and disease severity were evaluated. A pathogenicity index was proposed as a new selection criterion. SELEGEN (EMBRAPA) software was used for the evaluation of the genetic control in all traits investigated. Overall incidence rate was 39 % and severity was 13 %. Mean clonal heritability for severity was h(2)mc= 0.59 and for incidence h(2)mc= 0.47, these values were high evidencing that both traits are under a strong genetic control. The pathogenicity index becomes a useful discrimination criterion for ranking genotypes by their disease tolerance. An infection pattern inversely proportional to the DBH was observed. Although none of the 34 genotypes evaluated recorded total resistance to C. fimbriata, eight of these genotypes show strong genetic tolerance to the disease, and high productivity. Their use can be encouraging and will contribute to the reduction of Ceratocystis wilt impact in the country, as well as in the tropical Latin America region.

TI  - Phosphorus and sulfur in a tropical soil and their effects on growth and selenium accumulation in<i>Leucaena leucocephala</i>(Lam.) de Wit
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB  - Selenium (Se) is an essential metalloid element for mammals. Nonetheless, both deficiency and excess of Se in the environment are associated with several diseases in animals and humans. Here, we investigated the interaction of Se, supplied as selenate (Se+6) and selenite (Se+4), with phosphorus (P) and sulfur (S) in a weathered tropical soil and their effects on growth and Se accumulation inLeucaena leucocephala(Lam.) de Wit. The P-Se interaction effects onL. leucocephalagrowth differed between the Se forms (selenate and selenite) supplied in the soil. Selenate was prejudicial to plants grown in the soil with low P dose, while selenite was harmful to plants grown in soil with high P dose. The decreasing soil S dose increased the toxic effect of Se inL. leucocephalaplants. Se tissue concentration and total Se accumulation inL. leucocephalashoot were higher with selenate supply in the soil when compared with selenite. Therefore, selenite proved to be less phytoavailable in the weathered tropical soil and, at the same time, more toxic toL. leucocephalaplants than selenate. Thus, it is expected thatL. leucocephalaplants are more efficient to phytoextract and accumulate Se as selenate than Se as selenite from weathered tropical soils, for either strategy of phytoremediation (decontamination of Se-polluted soils) or purposes of biofortification for animal feed (fertilization of Se-poor soils).

TI  - Counteracting the Negative Effects of Copper Limitations Through the Biostimulatory Action of a Tropical Plant Extract in Grapevine Under Pedo-Climatic Constraints
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
AB  - In southern Mediterranean areas, vineyards are facing the combination of increasing air temperature, drought and frequency of extreme events (e.g., heat waves) due to climate change. Since most of the berry growth and ripening phases occur during the aridity period, such environmental constraints are responsible for limitations in yield and berry quality. Within this scenario, to achieve vineyard sustainability, renewed approaches in vineyard management have been proposed and the use of plant biostimulants seems a prominent and environmental friendly practice. The aim of this study was to test four combinations of a tropical plant extract and conventional chemicals for disease control on morpho-anatomical, physiological, biochemical and berry quality in Vitis vinifera L. subsp. vinifera "Aglianico." In particular, we aimed to evaluate the possibility to counteract the negative effects of the reductions in copper distribution, by applying the tropical plant extract enriched with: micronutrients, enzymes involved in the activation of natural defense, aminoacids, and vitamins. The halved dose of Cu in combination with the tropical plant extract allowed maintaining a reduced vegetative vigor. In the second year of treatment, the addition of the plant extract significantly improved leaf gas exchanges and photochemistry as well as the synthesis of photosynthetic pigments. At berry level, the plant extract induced an increase in phenolics accompanied by a decrease in soluble sugars. The overall results showed that the expected differences in growth performance and productivity in vines are linked to different eco-physiological and structural properties induced by the various treatments. The tropical plant extract also primed plant defenses at the leaf and fruit levels, mainly due to modifications of some structural and biochemical traits, respectively.

TI  - Serologic Survey of <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> in Noncarnivorous Free-Ranging Neotropical Mammals in French Guiana
T2  - VECTOR-BORNE AND ZOONOTIC DISEASES
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of Toxoplasma infection in wild mammals, particularly noncarnivorous species, and to identify possible sources of infection for humans. A serological study was conducted that included 310 animals representing 10 species of terrestrial mammals from the same region (primary tropical rain forest inhabited by humans). Toxoplasmosis was diagnosed using a direct agglutination test using formalin-treated Toxoplasma gondii. The prevalence of antibodies for toxoplasmosis differed greatly between species and ranged from 0% to 62%. The seroprevalence of toxoplasmosis was zero or very low for tree-dwelling animals, which included sloth, porcupine, and howler monkey. Conversely, the prevalence of infection was 46-62% among granivores, insectivores, and burrowing animals, such as peccary, paca, and armadillo. We conclude that wild mammals in French Guiana constitute a reservoir of T. gondii parasites. Given the absence of domestic cats from the forest, noncarnivorous species may be infected by the ingestion of oocysts that are eliminated into the soil or water in the stools of wild cats and then dispersed.

TI  - Forest onchocerciasis in Cameroon: Its distribution and implications for selection of communities for control programmes
T2  - ANNALS OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND PARASITOLOGY
AB  - The prevalences of infection and disease due to Onchocerca volvulus in regions at different altitudes and distances from the nearest breeding site for the Simulium vectors were studied in a forested area of Cameroon. A total of 1785 subjects in 14 villages underwent clinical and parasitological evaluation. According to WHO endemicity criteria, villages 265 and 720 m above sea level (asl) were hyperendemic, whereas lower villages, at 55 m asl, were meso-endemic. Altitude was positively correlated and distance from vector breeding site negatively correlated with several clinical indicators of onchocerciasis: prevalence of infection, microfilarial density, onchocercomata, and blindness. Location and altitude of his or her village and the subject's duration of residence in the village, age and sex were all found to be independent predictors of infection by logistic regression. The observed pattern of forest onchocerciasis reflects an interplay of multiple factors rather than a simple relationship between endemicity and distance from the nearest river. In order to select communities most affected by onchocerciasis for control programmes, two indicators, the prevalence of blindness and the prevalence of onchocercomata, might be used.

TI  - Oil palm expansion increases the vectorial capacity of dengue vectors in Malaysian Borneo
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Changes in land-use and the associated shifts in environmental conditions can have large effects on the transmission and emergence of mosquito-borne disease. Mosquito-borne disease are particularly sensitive to these changes because mosquito growth, reproduction, survival and susceptibility to infection are all thermally sensitive traits, and land use change dramatically alters local microclimate. Predicting disease transmission under environmental change is increasingly critical for targeting mosquito-borne disease control and for identifying hotspots of disease emergence. Mechanistic models offer a powerful tool for improving these predictions. However, these approaches are limited by the quality and scale of temperature data and the thermal response curves that underlie predictions. Here, we used fine-scale temperature monitoring and a combination of empirical, laboratory and temperature-dependent estimates to estimate the vectorial capacity of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes across a tropical forest-oil palm plantation conversion gradient in Malaysian Borneo. We found that fine-scale differences in temperature between logged forest and oil palm plantation sites were not sufficient to produce differences in temperature-dependent demographic trait estimates using published thermal performance curves. However, when measured under field conditions a key parameter, adult abundance, differed significantly between land-use types, resulting in estimates of vectorial capacity that were 1.5 times higher in plantations than in forests. The prediction that oil palm plantations would support mosquito populations with higher vectorial capacity was robust to uncertainties in our adult survival estimates. These results provide a mechanistic basis for understanding the effects of forest conversion to agriculture on mosquito-borne disease risk, and a framework for interpreting emergent relationships between land-use and disease transmission. As the burden of Ae. albopictus-vectored diseases, such as dengue virus, increases globally and rising demand for palm oil products drives continued expansion of plantations, these findings have important implications for conservation, land management and public health policy at the global scale.

TI  - Occupational risk of exposure to rodent-borne hantavirus at US forest service facilities in California
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) is a frequently fatal viral disease transmitted through rodent secretions and excretions. Working around deer mice can increase risk of infection. This study assessed potential risk of HCPS at facilities occupied by the US Forest Service (USFS) in California. In 2004-2005, 18 USFS facilities in eight National Forests in California were evaluated for evidence of rodent infestation and circulation of hantavirus. Structural deficiencies and evidence of rodent infestation were observed at 18 facilities. Serum antibodies to hantavirus were detected in 50 of 255 deer mice collected from 15 facilities. Seroprevalence was higher at elevations > 1,600 in (22%). Employees at 14 facilities had received training in rodent-borne disease prevention. Risk of HCPS among USFS employees should motivate inclusion of disease prevention information into employee safety training.

TI  - Pharmaceutical agents for treatment of leishmaniasis: a patent landscape
T2  - EXPERT OPINION ON THERAPEUTIC PATENTS
AB  - Introduction Leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by protozoa of the genusLeishmania. Worldwide, approximately 1.5-2 million new cases of leishmaniasis and 20,000-30,000 deaths occurs each year. Effective treatment for all forms of leishmaniasis have numerous adverse effects contributing to poor adherence and/or treatment interruption by the patient. Development of novel therapies, as multitarget drugs, for example, can contribute to accelerate discover safer, more active, and patient-compliant drugs for leishmaniasis treatment. Areas covered In this review, authors summarize pharmaceutical agents for treatment of leishmaniasis developed between 2014 and 2019, which includes synthetic and natural drugs for specific treatments, as well as considering new approaches and strategies using drug delivery system. Expert opinion Universities or public research institutes produced most of the patents related to pharmaceutical agents for treatment of leishmaniasis in this review, and the majority of the inventions disclosed did not conduct clinical trials. In other words, there is still a lot of investment to be done for the identification of new drugs.

TI  - Effect of Oral Infection of Mayaro Virus on Fitness Correlates and Expression of Immune Related Genes in<i>Aedes aegypti</i>
T2  - VIRUSES-BASEL
AB  - Mayaro virus is a mosquito-borneAlphavirusendemic to forests of tropical South America with a sylvatic cycle involving non-human primates andHaemagogusmosquitoes. Human infection with Mayaro virus causes a febrile illness and long-lasting arthralgia and cases are often associated with exposure to tropical forest habitats. Human movement between tropical forest habitats and urban settings may allow for imported cases and subsequent local transmission by domestic mosquitoAedes aegypti. The relative importance ofAe. aegyptias a vector of Mayaro virus may depend on the pathogenic effects of the virus on fitness correlates, especially those entomological parameters that relate to vectorial capacity. We performed mosquito infection studies and compared adult survival and fecundity of females from Brazilian and Floridian populations ofAe. aegyptifollowing oral ingestion of uninfectious (control) and Mayaro virus infectious blood. Mayaro virus infected and refractory mosquitoes had similar or 30-50% lower fecundity than control (unexposed) mosquitoes, suggesting a reproductive cost to mounting an immune response or phenotypic expression of refractoriness. Survival of adult female mosquitoes and targeted gene expression in the Toll and IMD pathways were not altered by Mayaro virus infection. Adult lifespan and fecundity estimates were independent of measured viral titer in the bodies of mosquitoes. The lack of adverse effects of infection status on female survival suggests that Mayaro virus will not alter vectorial capacity mediated by changes in this parameter.

TI  - An evaluation of the wilt-causing bacterium <i>Ralstonia solanacearum</i> as a potential biological control agent for the alien kahili ginger (<i>Hedychium gardnerianum</i>) in Hawaiian forests
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONTROL
AB  - Kahili ginger (Hedychium gardnerianum) is an invasive weed in tropical forests in Hawaii and elsewhere. Bacterial wilt caused by the ginger strain of Ralstonia (=Pseudomonas) solanacearum systemically infects edible ginger (Zingiber officinale) and ornamental gingers (Hedychium spp.), causing wilt in infected plants. The suitability of R. solanacearum as a biological control agent for kahili ginger was investigated by inoculating seedlings and rooted cuttings of native forest plants, ornamental ginger, and solanaceous species to confirm host specificity, Inoculation via stem injection or root wounding with a bacterial-water suspension was followed by observation for 8 weeks. Inoculations on H. gardnerianum were then carried out in ohia-lehua (Metrosideros polymorpha) wet forests of Hawaii Volcanoes National Park to determine the bacterium's efficacy in the field. No native forest or solanaceous species developed wilt or other symptoms during the study, The bacterium caused limited infection near the inoculation site on H. coronarium, Z. zerumbet, Heliconia latispatha, and Musa sapientum. However, infection did not become systemic in any of these species, and normal growth resumed following appearance of initial symptoms. All inoculated H. gardnerianum plants developed irreversible chlorosis and severe wilting 3-4 weeks following inoculation. Systemic infection also caused death and decay of rhizomes. Most plants were completely dead 16-20 weeks following inoculation. The destructiveness of the ginger strain of R. solanacearum to edible ginger has raised questions regarding its use for biological control. However, because locations of kahili ginger infestations are often remote, the risk of contaminating edible ginger plantings is unlikely. The ability of this bacterium to cause severe disease in H. gardnerianum in the field, together with its lack of virulence in other ginger species, contributes to its potential as a biological control agent.

TI  - Identification and Characterization of Fungi Causing Thread Blight Diseases on Cacao in Ghana
T2  - PLANT DISEASE
AB  - Theobroma cacao (chocolate tree) is currently under serious threat from thread blight disease (TBD), which has been attributed to the causal agent Marasmiellus scandens in other regions of the world. TBD in Ghana has similar symptomology but variable signs. This study sought to determine whether TBD in Ghana was caused by a single agent and whether Marasmiellus scandens was a significant agent of TBD. Forty-eight isolates were collected from eight geographical locations in Ghana for morphological and molecular characterization. Disease signs occurred as vegetative rhizomorphs or hyphal aggregates, which were classified into five morphotypes: A, abundant thin, black, horse hair-type rhizomorphs; B, scattered brown rhizomorphs; C, whitish to brownish-white; D, faint cream or dull white; and E, aggregates of shiny or silky white hyphae. Sequencing and analyses of three loci-the internal transcribed spacer region of the nuclear ribosomal repeat, nuclear large subunit, and mitochondrial small subunit-detected four species, all members of the Marasmiaceae, causing TBD-like disease. These were identified as Marasmius crinis-equi (morphotype A), Marasmius tenuissimus (morphotypes B and C), Marasmiellus palmivorus (morphotype E), and Marasmiellus scandens (morphotype D). Marasmius tenuissimus, the most frequently isolated TBD fungus in this study, is primarily an Asian fungus and not previously associated with diseases of cacao. Marasmiellus palmivorus, the second most frequently isolated fungus, is a pan-tropical pathogen with a broad host range; this is the first report of the fungus causing TBD on cacao. Marasmius crinis-equi also has a broad pan-tropical distribution and host range and causes thread blight on several tropical tree crops. Surprisingly, Marasmiellus scandens, the most frequently cited agent of TBD in cacao, made up only 8% of the isolates.

TI  - Patterns and seasonality of malaria transmission in the forest-savannah transitional zones of Ghana
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
AB  - Background: Knowledge of the local pattern of malaria transmission and the effect of season on transmission is essential for the planning and evaluation of malaria interventions. Therefore, entomological surveys were carried out in the forest-savannah transitional belt of Ghana (Kintampo) from November 2003 to November 2005 in preparation for drug and vaccine trials.
   Results: A total of 23,406 mosquitoes were caught from 919 traps over the two-year period (November 2003 to November 2005): 54.3% were Culicines, 36.2% Anopheles funestus, and 9.4% Anopheles gambiae. Infection rates with Plasmodium falciparum were 4.7% and 1.5% for Anopheles gambiae and Anopheles funestus, respectively. Entomological inoculation rates (EIRs) were 269 infective bites per person per year in the first year (November 2003-October 2004) and 231 the following year (November 2004-November 2005). Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) analysis detected only Anopheles gambiae s.s. Nineteen mosquitoes were tested by PCR in the wet season; 16 were S-molecular form, 2 M-molecular form and 1 hybrid (S/M). In the dry season, sixteen mosquitoes were tested; 11 S-molecular form, 2 M-molecular form and 3 S/M hybrids. The frequency of knock down resistance (kdr) genotypes F(R) was 0.60.
   Conclusion: The dynamics and seasonal abundance of malaria vectors in the Kintampo area was influenced by micro-ecology, rainfall and temperature patterns. Transmission patterns did not differ significantly between the two years (2004 and 2005) and both Anopheles gambiae and Anopheles funestus were identified as effective vectors. EIR estimates in 2004/2005 were between 231 and 269 infective bites per person per year. The information provided by the study will help in planning intensified malaria control activities as well as evaluating the impact of malaria interventions in the middle belt of Ghana.

TI  - The socio-economic drivers of bushmeat consumption during the West African Ebola crisis
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Bushmeat represents an important source of animal protein for humans in tropical Africa. Unsustainable bushmeat hunting is a major threat to wildlife and its consumption is associated with an increased risk of acquiring zoonotic diseases, such as Ebola virus disease (EVD). During the recent EVD outbreak in West Africa, it is likely that human dietary behavior and local attitudes toward bushmeat consumption changed in response to the crisis, and that the rate of change depended on prevailing socio-economic conditions, including wealth and education. In this study, we therefore investigated the effects of income, education, and literacy on changes in bushmeat consumption during the crisis, as well as complementary changes in daily meal frequency, food diversity and bushmeat preference. More specifically, we tested whether wealthier households with more educated household heads decreased their consumption of bushmeat during the EVD crisis, and whether their daily meal frequency and food diversity remained constant. We used Generalized Linear Mixed Models to analyze interview data from two nationwide household surveys across Liberia. We found an overall decrease in bushmeat consumption during the crisis across all income levels. However, the rate of bushmeat consumption in high-income households decreased less than in low- income households. Daily meal frequency decreased during the crisis, and the diversity of food items and preferences for bushmeat species remained constant. Our multidisciplinary approach to study the impact of EVD can be applied to assess how other disasters affect social-ecological systems and improve our understanding and the management of future crises.

TI  - DIVERSITY PATTERNS OF NEOTROPICAL PLANT PARASITIC MICROFUNGI
T2  - ECOTROPICA
AB  - Species richness in different groups of microfungi causing disease symptoms on above-ground plant organs is analyzed based on checklists and databases of five tropical regions in the Americas and two regions outside the tropics in North America. In addition, primary data on plant parasitic microfungi collected in natural habitats in western Panama are considered. According to these data, Asterinaceae, Meliolales, Phyllachorales, and rust fungi are highly species rich groups in the Neotropics, while smut fungi appear to be less diverse in the tropics than in extratropical regions. Species of Albuginales, Erysiphales, Peronosporales, and Taphrinales are rarely found in the tropics, and are especially scarce in tropical forests. Morphologically, many tropical plant parasitic microfungi are characterized by melanized walls of fruiting bodies and spores, apparently an adaptation to tropical conditions with strong solar radiation. Gelatinous substances may slow down the process of drying out. The absence of a winter season in the tropics is probably the reason for the lack of spore dormancy and the dominance of asexual developmental stages in the Erysiphales and rust fungi.

TI  - Mapping land cover change in northern Brazil with limited training data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
AB  - Deforestation in the Amazon has important implications for biodiversity and climate change. However, land cover monitoring in this tropical forest is a challenge because it covers such a large area and the land cover change often occurs quickly, and sometimes cyclically. Here we adapt a method which eliminates the need to collect new training data samples for each update of an existing land cover map. We use the state-of-the-art probabilistic classifier Import Vector Machines and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) scenes of the area surrounding Novo Progresso, northern Brazil, to create an initial land cover map for 2013 with associated classification probabilities. We then conduct spectral change detection between 2013 and 2015 using a pair of Landsat images in order to identify the areas where land cover has changed between the two dates, and then reclassify these areas using a supervised classification algorithm, using pixels from the unchanged areas of the map as training data. In this study, we use the pixels with the highest classification probabilities to train the classifier for 2015 and compare the results to those obtained when pixels are chosen randomly. The use of probabilities in the selection of training samples improves the results compared to a random selection, with the highest overall accuracy achieved when 250 training samples with high probabilities are used. For training sample sizes greater than 1000, the differences in overall accuracy between the two approaches to training sample selection are reduced. The final updated 2015 map has an overall accuracy of 80.1%, compared to an overall accuracy of 82.5% for the 2013 map. The results show that this probabilistic method has potential to efficiently map the dynamic land cover change in the Amazon with limited training data, although some challenges remain.

TI  - The amphibian chytrid <i>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</i> occurs on freshwater shrimp in rain forest streams in Northern Queensland, Australia
T2  - ECOHEALTH
AB  - Chytridiomycosis is a disease of amphibians caused by the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. It can be highly virulent and is unusual in that it appears to drive many host species to local extinction during outbreaks. One mechanism that could facilitate this is the ability to grow saprophytically or on alternative hosts. This is common in other chytrids but has not been demonstrated for B. dendrobatidis in the field. B. dendrobatidis can grow on arthropod exoskeletons in the laboratory, and freshwater shrimp can be the most abundant animals in tropical rain forest streams. We therefore used diagnostic quantitative polymerase chain reaction to determine the infection status of freshwater shrimp from areas in which they are sympatric with frog species that have suffered declines in association with outbreaks of chytridiomycosis. We detected B. dendrobatidis on three individual shrimp belonging to two genera and collected from two widely separated streams. Two of the individuals had high levels of infection. This indicates that the presence of alternative hosts is likely to contribute to the extreme virulence of chytridiomycosis outbreaks in some systems. The presence of alternative hosts may allow B. dendrobatidis to remain in the environment after local extinctions of amphibian hosts, preventing the recovery of amphibian populations.

TI  - Bibliometric analysis of schistosomiasis research in Southeast Asia (1908-2020)
T2  - ACTA TROPICA
AB  - Objectives: This study determined the characteristics and trends of published articles regarding schistosomiasis in Southeast Asian countries through a bibliometric analysis.
   Methods: Using the Scopus database, we identified all original research articles on schistosomiasis from 1908 to 2020 from SEA countries: Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. Bibliographic and citation information was obtained, and visualization of collaboration networks of countries and keywords related to schistosomiasis was conducted using VOSviewer software.
   Results: We obtained 528 schistosomiasis articles published between 1908 and 2020 from SEA countries. The number of publications continued to increase and peaked from 2000 until 2020. The Philippines had the highest number of publications (n = 231), followed by Thailand (n = 153), and Malaysia (n = 64). The leading journals with the highest number of publications in this field include the Southeast Asian Journal of Tropical Medicine and Public Health (n = 96), Acta Tropica (n = 27), and Plos Neglected Tropical Diseases (n = 24). The most common keywords related to schistosomiasis research in SEA were "schistosomiasis", "Schistosoma japonicum", "Schistosoma mekongi", "Schistosoma mansoni", and "praziquantel". International collaboration was significantly correlated with scientific productivity for schistosomiasis research.
   Conclusion: Our study showed the research landscape, trends and development, and collaboration among researchers in schistosomiasis in SEA. Our results also revealed the limited schistosomiasis research in several SEA countries. There is a need for more research to improve our understanding of the epidemiology of schistosomiasis in SEA, which can help in improving the control and prevention of this disease.

TI  - Advocacy and Activism as Essential Tools in Primate Conservation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY
AB  - Primates are facing a global extinction crisis driven by an expanding human population, environmental degradation, the conversion of tropical forests into monocultures for industrial agriculture and cattle ranching, unsustainable resource extraction, hunting, climate change, and the threat of emerging zoonotic diseases. And, although many primate scientists have dedicated their careers to conservation, 65% of primate species are listed as Vulnerable, Endangered, or Critically Endangered, and >75% are experiencing a population decline. Projections indicate that by the end of the century, an additional 75% of the area currently occupied by wild primates will be lost to agriculture. Clearly, we are losing the battle and must change business-as-usual if we are to protect wild primates and their habitats. This article is a call to action. Primate societies and their membership need to expand their engagement in scientific advocacy and scientific activism designed to educate, inspire, organize, and mobilize global citizens to join together, lobby business leaders and politicians in both primate habitat countries and in consumer nations, boycott forest-risk products, participate in demonstrations and letter writing campaigns, and use social media to effect transformational change. We are the experts, and the more we and our professional organizations drive the public policy debate on wildlife conservation and environmental justice, the more successful we will be in protecting the world's primates from extinction. The time to act is now!

TI  - Inferring Species Diversity and Variability over Climatic Gradient with Spectral Diversity Metrics
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Filling in the void between forest ecology and remote sensing through monitoring biodiversity variables is of great interest. In this study, we utilized imaging spectroscopy data from the ISRO-NASA Airborne Visible InfraRed Imaging Spectrometer-Next Generation (AVIRIS-NG) India campaign to investigate how the measurements of biodiversity attributes of forests over wide areas can be augmented by synchronous field- and spectral-metrics. Three sites, Shoolpaneshwar Wildlife Sanctuary (SWS), Vansda National Park (VNP), and Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (MTR), spread over a climatic gradient (rainfall and temperature), were selected for this study. Abundant species maps of three sites were produced using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier with a 76-80% overall accuracy. These maps are a valuable input for forest resource management. Convex hull volume (CHV) is computed from the first three principal components of AVIRIS-NG spectra and used as a spectral diversity metric. It was observed that CHV increased with species numbers showing a positive correlation between species and spectral diversity. Additionally, it was observed that the abundant species show higher spectral diversity over species with lesser spread, provisionally revealing their functional diversity. This could be one of the many reasons for their expansive reach through adaptation to local conditions. Higher rainfall at MTR was shown to have a positive impact on species and spectral diversity as compared to SWS and VNP. Redundancy analysis explained 13-24% of the variance in abundant species distribution because of climatic gradient. Trends in spectral CHVs observed across the three sites of this study indicate that species assemblages may have strong local controls, and the patterns of co-occurrence are largely aligned along climatic gradient. Observed changes in species distribution and diversity metrics over climatic gradient can help in assessing these forests' responses to the projected dynamics of rainfall and temperature in the future.

TI  - A Comparative Assessment of Machine-Learning Techniques for Land Use and Land Cover Classification of the Brazilian Tropical Savanna Using ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 Polarimetric Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - This study proposes a workflow for land use and land cover (LULC) classification of Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 (ALOS-2) Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar-2 (PALSAR-2) images of the Brazilian tropical savanna (Cerrado) biome. The following LULC classes were considered: forestlands; shrublands; grasslands; reforestations; croplands; pasturelands; bare soils/straws; urban areas; and water reservoirs. The proposed approach combines polarimetric attributes, image segmentation, and machine-learning procedures. A set of 125 attributes was generated using polarimetric ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 images, including the van Zyl, Freeman-Durden, Yamaguchi, and Cloude-Pottier target decomposition components, incoherent polarimetric parameters (biomass indices and polarization ratios), and HH-, HV-, VH-, and VV-polarized amplitude images. These attributes were classified using the Naive Bayes (NB), DT J48 (DT = decision tree), Random Forest (RF), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms. The RF, MLP, and SVM classifiers presented the most accurate performances. NB and DT J48 classifiers showed a lower performance in relation to the RF, MLP, and SVM. The DT J48 classifier was the most suitable algorithm for discriminating urban areas and natural vegetation cover. The proposed workflow can be replicated for other SAR images with different acquisition modes or for other types of vegetation domains.

TI  - Prevalence and Risk Factors of Lassa Seropositivity in Inhabitants of the Forest Region of Guinea: A Cross-Sectional Study
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background: Lassa fever is a viral hemorrhagic fever endemic in West Africa. The reservoir host of the virus is a multimammate rat, Mastomys natalensis. Prevalence estimates of Lassa virus antibodies in humans vary greatly between studies, and the main modes of transmission of the virus from rodents to humans remain unclear. We aimed to (i) estimate the prevalence of Lassa virus-specific IgG antibodies (LV IgG) in the human population of a rural area of Guinea, and (ii) identify risk factors for positive LV IgG.
   Methods and Findings: A population-based cross-sectional study design was used. In April 2000, all individuals one year of age and older living in three prefectures located in the tropical secondary forest area of Guinea (Gueckedou, Lola and Yomou) were sampled using two-stage cluster sampling. For each individual identified by the sampling procedure and who agreed to participate, a standardized questionnaire was completed to collect data on personal exposure to potential risk factors for Lassa fever (mainly contact with rodents), and a blood sample was tested for LV IgG. A multiple logistic regression model was used to determine risk factors for positive LV IgG. A total of 1424 subjects were interviewed and 977 sera were tested. Prevalence of positive LV Ig was of 12.9% [10.8%-15.0%] and 10.0% [8.1%-11.9%] in rural and urban areas, respectively. Two risk factors of positive LV IgG were identified: to have, in the past twelve months, undergone an injection (odds ratio [OR] = 1.8 [1.1-3.1]), or lived with someone displaying a haemorrhage (OR = 1.7 [1.1-2.9]). No factors related to contacts with rats and/or mice remained statistically significant in the multivariate analysis.
   Conclusions: Our study underlines the potential importance of person-to-person transmission of Lassa fever, via close contact in the same household or nosocomial exposure.

TI  - Drivers of Bushmeat Hunting and Perceptions of Zoonoses in Nigerian Hunting Communities
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Bushmeat hunting threatens biodiversity and increases the risk of zoonotic pathogen transmission. Nevertheless, limited information exists on patterns of contact with wildlife in communities that practice bushmeat hunting, especially with respect to social drivers of hunting behavior. We used interview responses from hunters and non-hunters in rural hunting communities in Nigeria to: 1) quantify contact rates with wildlife, 2) identify specific hunting behaviors that increase frequency of contact, 3) identify socioeconomic factors that predispose individuals to hunt, and 4) measure perceptions of risk. Participants engaged in a variety of behaviors that increased contact with wild animals, including: butchering to sell (37%), being injured (14%), using body parts for traditional medicine (19%), collecting carcasses found in forests and/or farms (18%), and keeping as pets (16%). Hunters came into contact with wildlife significantly more than non-hunters, even through non-hunting exposure pathways. Participants reported hunting rodents (95%), ungulates (93%), carnivores (93%), primates (87%), and bats (42%), among other prey. Reported hunting frequencies within taxonomic groups of prey were different for different hunting behaviors. Young age, lower education level, larger household size, having a father who hunts, and cultural group were all associated with becoming a hunter. Fifty-five percent of respondents were aware that they could contract diseases from wild animals, but only 26% of these individuals reported taking protective measures. Overall, hunters in this setting frequently contact a diversity of prey in risky ways, and the decision to become a hunter stems from family tradition, modified by economic necessity. Conservation and public health interventions in such settings may be most efficient when they capitalize on local knowledge and target root socio-economic and cultural drivers that lead to hunting behavior. Importantly, interventions that target consumption alone will not be sufficient; other drivers and modes of interaction with wildlife must also be considered.

TI  - Reducing conflict between the common vampire bat <i>Desmodus rotundus</i> and cattle ranching in Neotropical landscapesPalabras clave
T2  - MAMMAL REVIEW
AB  - Increased cattle ranching in Neotropical landscapes has led to human-wildlife conflicts that complicate the relationship between agricultural production and biodiversity conservation. We review the literature related to conflicts between livestock production and the common vampire bat Desmodus rotundus, specifically, the factors that influence the incidence of problems caused by bites to cattle. We summarise the strategies proposed to reduce these problems and propose actions from the perspectives of cattle management, landscape ecology and the biology of the common vampire bat. The literature shows that free-range extensive management systems, where cattle graze in areas with forest cover, near riparian zones, caves, secondary vegetation (generally shrublands and immature trees), and vegetation fragments and edges, increase the implications and the severity of the conflict. As a result of different selection forces, the wing morphology and echolocation characteristics of the common vampire bat facilitate its movement under these landscape conditions, thus favouring a scenario of greater interaction with cattle. We propose the establishment of a 'buffer zone' to separate the cattle as far as possible (at least 1 km) from the elements of the landscape that are key for the movement patterns of common vampire bats in cattle ranching areas. The feeding events of this species are positively associated with host availability and landscape elements that provide habitat and connectivity, which shows that the cause of this conflict originates from the process of cattle production and the invasion of the habitat of the common vampire bat. Anti-rabies vaccination programmes in cattle and forest-cattle separation are the most important strategies to minimise conflict and prevent rabies outbreaks.

TI  - Characteristics Associated with Contact with Rodents In, Around, and Outside Homes in Khon Kaen Province, Thailand
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Rodents are an important reservoir for zoonotic diseases. To enhance the evidence on the human-rodent interface, this cross-sectional study was conducted in 2011 to investigate characteristics associated with rodent contact in Khon Kaen Province, Thailand. A standardized, interviewer-administered questionnaire elicited information from 201 adults (101 males and 100 females). Overall, 86.6% of participants reported encountering or seeing evidence of rodents in or near the home, whereas 57.2% encountered rodents while working with crops. Encountering rodents in or near the home was positively associated with the number of agricultural activities, whereas encountering rodents during crop work was positively associated with perceiving that disease can be acquired from rodents, the number of food crops grown, the number of agricultural activities, and living in a house with wooden walls. Surprisingly, neither outcome was associated appreciably with gender, age, or setting (urban, forest, or agricultural). These results provide information on the potential risk of rodent-borne zoonoses; this evidence has implications for risk communication strategies in this province and likely elsewhere.

TI  - An Assessment on Bat Diversity in Curitiba, Parana State, Subtropical Brazil
T2  - BRAZILIAN ARCHIVES OF BIOLOGY AND TECHNOLOGY
AB  - Urbanization changes natural environments making them inhospitable to autochthonous fauna. However, studies have shown that certain groups and animal species tolerate urban habitat or even benefit from it as is the case of some bats. This study assesses the diversity of bats in Curitiba, Southern Brazil, providing a basis for the discussion on their conservation, management, ecological services provide, and the critical evaluation of their role in the zoonoses of interest for public health. The data was compiled from a combination of museum, historical and recent literature (1824 to 2020), records to identify which bat species have actually been captured or recorded in Curitiba. The results indicate 29 species (five of them threatened with extinction) from four families: Phyllostomidae, Noctilionidae, Molossidae and Vespertilionidae. Insectivorous bats (Molossidae and Vespertilionidae) represent 62.1% of the species recorded; and the primarily frugivorous (Phyllostomidae) 24.1%, followed by nectarivorous/polinivorous species (6.9%), insectivorous/frugivorous (ca. 3.4%) and piscivorous/insectivorous (ca. 3.4%). Fruit-eating bats seem to prefer urban green areas while insectivores tend to occupy human-made structures. Our results show that this high-growth potential diversity bears both a numerical and ecological relevance. It is worth remembering that Curitiba is in Brazil's subtropical area, where the richness of bat species is lower, and the predominant species are different from those in the tropical region of the country. Finally, studies on the natural history of bats (feeding, reproduction, roosting, etc.) in Curitiba are scarce and urgently necessary given to the current pandemic scenario where these traditionally stigmatized animals have been even more depreciated by public opinion.

TI  - Strategies of flowering in dioecious plants in tropical coastal vegetation, Brazil
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
AB  - Dioecious species are dependent on pollen vectors for sexual reproductive success. Male and female plants can express different blooming strategies, which respectively favour pollen donation and reception. This study characterised the flowering phenology of ten dioecious species, with different floral resources and pollination systems. The study focused on an area of sandy coastal plain in southeastern Brazil. We evaluated flowering events of male and female plants, in addition to the distribution of species flowering periods over 2 years. Regardless of the dependence upon biotic pollinators, all species shared the following traits: a single or a more expressive flowering event per year, with a duration ranging from intermediate to long, a high percentage of activity and intensity and high synchronism rates for intra-and inter-sexual morphs. In most species, males flowered first and more intensely following a sex allocation perspective. The flowering periods of dioecious species were randomly distributed throughout the year, preventing the identification of phenological drivers. The results suggest that the biotic (floral resources, pollen vector), abiotic (temperature, precipitation, day length) and phylogenetic factors do not seem to explain the observed flowering strategies. Since the restinga is a geologically recent tropical environment, the phenological attributes of the dioecious species possibly reflect the individual patterns of colonising species more than it does the interactions among them and with the environment.

TI  - Chagas disease in the Amazon region
T2  - MEMORIAS DO INSTITUTO OSWALDO CRUZ
CP  - Workshop on Epidemiological and Social Determinants Factors of Changas Disease
AB  - The risk that Chagas disease becomes established as a major endemic threat in Amazonia (the world's largest tropical biome, today inhabited by over 30 million people) relates to a complex set of interacting biological and social determinants. These include intense immigration from endemic areas (possibly introducing parasites and vectors), extensive landscape transformation with uncontrolled deforestation, and the great diversity of wild Trypanosoma cruzi reservoir hosts and vectors (25 species in nine genera), which maintain intense sylvatic transmission cycles. Invasion of houses by adventitious vectors (with infection rates > 60%) is common, and focal adaptation of native triatomines to artificial structures has been reported. Both acute (similar to 500) and chronic cases of autochthonous human Chagas disease have been documented beyond doubt in the region. Continuous, low-intensity transmission seems to occur throughout the Amazon, and generates a hypoendemic pattern with seropositivity rates of similar to 1-3%. Discrete foci also exist in which transmission is more intense (e.g., in localized outbreaks probably linked to oral transmission) and prevalence rates higher. Early detection-treatment of acute cases is crucial for avoiding further dispersion of endemic transmission of Chagas disease in Amazonia, and will require the involvement of malaria control and primary health care systems. Comprehensive eco-epidemiological research, including prevalence surveys or the characterization of transmission dynamics in different ecological settings, is still needed. The International Initiative for Chagas Disesae Surveillance and Prevention in the Amazon provides the framework for building up the political and scientific cooperation networks required to confront the challenge of preventing Chagas disease in Amazonia.

TI  - Topographic and spectral data resolve land cover misclassification to distinguish and monitor wetlands in western Uganda
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Wetlands provide vital wildlife habitat and ecosystem services, but changes in human land use has made them one of the world's most threatened ecosystems. Although wetlands are generally protected by law, growing human populations increasingly drain and clear them to provide agricultural land, especially in tropical Africa. Managing and conserving wetlands requires accurately monitoring their spatial and temporal extent, often using remote sensing, but distinguishing wetlands from other land covers can be difficult. Here, we report on a method to separate wetlands dominated by papyrus (Cyperus papyrus L.) from spectrally similar grasslands dominated by elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum Schumach.). We tested whether topographic, spectral, and temperature data improved land cover classification within and around Kibale National Park, a priority conservation area in densely populated western Uganda. Slope and reflectance in the mid-IR range best separated the combined papyrus/elephant grass pixels (average accuracy: 86%). Using a time series of satellite images, we quantified changes in six land covers across the landscape from 1984 to 2008 (papyrus, elephant grass, forest, mixed agriculture/bare soil/short grass, mixed tea/shrub, and water). We found stark differences in how land cover changed inside versus outside the park, with particularly sharp changes next to the park boundary. Inside the park, changes in land cover varied with location and management history: elephant grass areas decreased by 52% through forest regeneration but there was no net difference in papyrus areas. Outside the park, elephant grass and papyrus areas decreased by 61% and 39%, mostly converted to agriculture. Our method and findings are particularly relevant in light of social, biotic, and abiotic changes in western Uganda, as interactions between climate change, infectious disease, and changing human population demographics and distribution are predicted to intensify existing agricultural pressure on natural areas.

TI  - Spatial modeling of soil loss as a response to land use-land cover change in Didessa sub-basin, the agricultural watershed of Ethiopia
T2  - HELIYON
AB  - Soil erosion is a vector of disturbances to agricultural productivity and economic development in the western highlands of Ethiopia. Yet, tough vegetation cover loss swapped to other land uses could have amplified the soil loss rate at which land cover change preceded, but little is known about their effects on soil loss in the Limu-Seqa watershed. This study was designed to evaluate the historical trends of the effects of land use-land cover change on soil erosion dynamics as a threshold for potential monitoring of soil loss. Satellite image data of 1987, 2002, 2021, and DEM-20 m resolution were used. The RUSLE model was applied with primary parameters to generate soil loss. Findings show that average annual soil loss increased from 4.5 in 1987 to 13.5 t ha(-1) yr(-1) in 2002 and surpassed to 45.35 t ha(-1) yr(-1) in 2021 as a result of LULC changes, particularly the transition of forest and overgrazed land to cropland (43.83%) and dense-forest to poor-open-up forest (6.92%) between 1987 and 2021. Soil loss during the recent study period was substantially affected by a substantial LULC change, from forest to cropland. The severe and very severe erosion risk categories jointly cover more than half of the entire catchment, which contributes to two-thirds of the total mean annual soil loss in the watershed, which is found to be over and above soil loss tolerance (SLT) in Ethiopia and tropical regions. Therefore, given the robust economic and political status of priority conservation measures, red hues areas are significant.

TI  - Cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by <i>Leishmania donovani</i> in the tribal population of the Agasthyamala Biosphere Reserve forest, Western Ghats, Kerala, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), a neglected tropical disease, is reported to be prevalent in tribal villages located in the Agasthyamala Biosphere Reserve forests of Western Ghats, Kerala state, India. We carried out an investigation to characterize the species of Leishmania parasites involved in these infections prevalent among one of the oldest human tribal populations in India. Skin aspirates collected from 13 clinically diagnosed cases were subjected to histopathological investigations, serological rapid tests using 'rk39' and molecular diagnostics. Clinical manifestations recorded among the patients were hypo-pigmented erythematous nodules/papules on limbs and other parts of the body. Histopathological investigations of these skin lesions among patients showed Leishman-Donovan bodies in macrophages. None of the patients were found to be positive for rk39 tests, which detect active visceral leishmaniasis. Using three different genetic markers [kinetoplast minicircle DNA, 3' UTR region of heat-shock protein 70 (Hsp70) and Hsp70 gene] we identified the parasite species involved in these infections to be Leishmania donovani. The 6-phosphogluconate (6-PGDH) gene sequences of the parasite isolates from Western Ghats indicated close genetic relatedness to L. donovani isolates reported from Sri Lanka, also causing CL. This could be cited as another instance of 'local endemism' of organisms in this single 'bio-geographic unit'.

TI  - Rapid elemental prediction of heterogeneous tropical soils from pXRF data: a comparison of models via linear regressions and machine learning algorithms
T2  - SOIL RESEARCH
AB  - Context. USEPA 3051a is a standard analytical methodology for the extraction of inorganic substances in soils. However, these analyses are expensive, time-consuming and produce chemical residues. Conversely, proximal sensors such as portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) spectrometry reduce analysis time, costs and consequently offer a valuable alternative to laboratory analyses.Aim. We aimed to investigate the feasibility to predict the results of the USEPA 3051a method for 28 chemical elements from pXRF data.Methods. Samples (n = 179) representing a large area from Brazil were analysed for elemental composition using the USEPA 3051a method and pXRF scanning (Al, Ca, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Mn, Ni, P, Pb, Sr, Ti, V, Zn and Zr). Linear regressions (simple linear regression - SLR and stepwise multiple linear regressions - SMLR) and machine learning algorithms (support vector machine - SVM and random forest - RF) were tested and compared. Modelling was developed with 70% of the data, while the remaining 30% were used for validation. Key results.Results demonstrated that SVM and RF performed better than SLR and SMLR for the prediction of Al, Ba, Bi, Ca, Cd, Ce, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, Mo, P, Pb, Sn, Sr, Ti, Tl, V, Zn and Zr; R-2 and RPD values ranged from 0.52 to 0.94 and 1.43 to 3.62, respectively, as well as the lowest values of RMSE and NRMSE values (0.28 to 0.70 mg kg(-1)).Conclusions and implications. Most USEPA 3051a results can be accurately predicted from pXRF data saving cost, time, and ensuring large-scale routine geochemical characterisation of tropical soils in an environmentally friendly way.

TI  - Mapping and dynamic analysis of mangrove forest during 2009-2019 using landsat-5 and sentinel-2 satellite data along Odisha Coast
T2  - TROPICAL ECOLOGY
AB  - Mangrove forests in India are situated along the tidal sea edge of the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal which is under threat from both natural and human-induced land-use changes. The multi-temporal satellite data and image processing techniques are usually employed to monitor changes in vegetation dynamics. In this study, the decadal changes of mangrove forests were accomplished along the Odisha coast, India using the Landsat-5 and Sentinel-2A satellite data for 2009 and 2019, respectively. The satellite data were obtained and processed in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. This study aims to derive the spatial extent of mangrove using the high-resolution satellite data and support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The result reveals that the total mangrove extent increased from 222.43 km(2)(2009) to 252.47 km(2)(2019) which indicates an increase in area by 30.04 km(2)(or 13.5%) during the last one decade. The highest increase in mangrove area was in Hatamudia Reserve Forest (15.54 km(2)) and coastal belt of Bhadrak (9.46 km(2)) followed by Bhitarkanika National Park in Kendrapara (3.05 km(2)), Baranaula and Akumi River estuary in Jagatsinghpur (1.12 km(2)), and Subarnarekha River intertidal zone in Baleshwar (0.87 km(2)). A significant increase in mangrove forests occurred due to plantation, awareness, restoration, and coastal zone management plan. This study demonstrates the potential of high-resolution satellite data to produce an accurate map in monitoring changes in mangrove forests at a decadal time-scale by using the GEE platform which can help in planning conservation strategies and priorities.

TI  - Mucocutaneous manifestations of helminth infections Nematodes
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY
AB  - In the 21st century, despite increased globalization through international travel for business, medical volunteerism, pleasure, and immigration/refugees into the United States, there is little published in the dermatology literature regarding the cutaneous manifestations of helminth infections. Approximately 17% of travelers seek medical care because of cutaneous disorders, many related to infectious etiologies. This review will focus on the cutaneous manifestations of helminth infections and is divided into 2 parts: part I focuses on nematode infections, and part II focuses on trematode and cestode infections. This review highlights the clinical manifestations, transmission, diagnosis, and treatment of helminth infections. Nematodes are roundworms that cause diseases with cutaneous manifestations, such as cutaneous larval migrans, onchocerciasis, filariasis, gnathostomiasis, loiasis, dracunculiasis, strongyloidiasis, ascariasis, streptocerciasis, dirofilariasis, and trichinosis. Tremadotes, also known as flukes, cause schistosomiasis, paragonimiasis, and fascioliasis. Cestodes (tapeworms) are flat, hermaphroditic parasites that cause diseases such as sparganosis, cysticercosis, and echinococcus.

TI  - Nest Site Characteristics of Two Endangered Seabirds in Montane Wet Forests on the Island of Kaua.i, Hawai'i, USA
T2  - WATERBIRDS
AB  - The nest site characteristics of two endangered seabird species-the Hawaiian Petrel Pterodroma sandwichensis and Newell's Shearwater Puffinus newelli-on Kaua'i were considered. Burrows of both species were predominantly found under tree roots or small caves on steep slopes and were associated with native plants, both in the canopy (particularly Metrosideros polymorpha) and the understory (particularly Dicranopteris linearis). There were, however, marked differences between the two species. Hawaiian Petrels were found at higher elevations with a shorter, patchy canopy and more open understory. Models using microhabitat variables were better able to classify burrows than those using landscape topographic metrics, suggesting that metrics describing the immediate area around the burrow are more important to burrow selection. A comparative model indicated that elevation and maximum vegetation height were the strongest variables in classifying between the two species. Understanding microhabitat needs for these species is important for locating new colonies and for the successful implementation of management actions such as colony creation through social attraction. Furthermore, with the spread of Rapid 'Ohi'a Death canker disease Ceratocystis huliohia on Kaua'i, the heavy reliance by both species on forest dominated by M. polymorpha (the tree killed by this disease) should be of increasing consideration for conservation efforts targeting these species.

TI  - <i>Evaluation of the anti-helminthic activity of crude extracts from the Brazilian Amazon and Mata Atlantica plants against</i> Haemonchus contortus
T2  - ARQUIVO BRASILEIRO DE MEDICINA VETERINARIA E ZOOTECNIA
AB  - Helminthosis play a crucial role in small ruminant production leading to enormous economic losses particularly in areas where extensive grazing is practiced. It causes a loss of production through mortality, weight loss, reduced milk and wool production. Haemonchus contortus is a highly pathogenic small ruminant helminthes parasite, which is capable of causing acute diseases and high mortality. Therefore, there is an urgent need to seek alternative or complementary solutions to the control of parasitic nematodes of ruminants. The tropical forests concentrate the highest biodiversity in the world, particularly those located in Brazil, whose species richness is estimated to account for 20% of the total world richness and little is known about the chemical and pharmacological potentialities of Brazilian tropical forests. In this work, organic and aqueous extracts were tested on eggs and in the larval development test on Haemonchus contortus. The organic extract obtained from leaves and fruits of Trichilia sp. and the aqueous extract obtained from the aerial organs of Phyllanthus attenuates showed significant activity related to the inhibition of H. contortus egg eclosion. In vitro results suggest that both extracts, as well as eleven other active extracts, can offer alternatives in sheep worm control.

TI  - Structural landscape of the complete genomes of dengue virus serotypes and other viral hemorrhagic fevers
T2  - BMC GENOMICS
AB  - BackgroundWith more than 300 million potentially infected people every year, and with the expanded habitat of mosquitoes due to climate change, Dengue virus (DENV) cannot be considered anymore only a tropical disease. The RNA secondary structure is a functional characteristic of RNA viruses, and together with the accumulated high-throughput sequencing data could provide general insights towards understanding virus biology. Here, we profiled the RNA secondary structure of >7000 complete viral genomes from 11 different species focusing on viral hemorrhagic fevers, including DENV serotypes, EBOV, and YFV.ResultsIn our work we demonstrated that the secondary structure and presence of protein-binding domains in the genomes can be used as intrinsic signature to further classify the viruses. With our predictive approach, we achieved high prediction scores of the secondary structure (AUC up to 0.85 with experimental data), and computed consensus secondary structure profiles using hundreds of in silico models. We observed that viruses show different structural patterns, where e.g., DENV-2 and Ebola virus tend to be less structured than the other viruses. Furthermore, we observed virus-specific correlations between secondary structure and the number of interaction sites with human proteins, reaching a correlation of 0.89 in the case of Zika virus. We also identified that helicases-encoding regions are more structured in several flaviviruses, while the regions encoding for the contact proteins exhibit virus-specific clusters in terms of RNA structure and potential protein-RNA interactions. We also used structural data to study the geographical distribution of DENV, finding a significant difference between DENV-3 from Asia and South-America, where the structure is also driving the clustering more than sequence identity, which could imply different evolutionary routes of this subtype.ConclusionsOur massive computational analysis provided novel results regarding the secondary structure and the interaction with human proteins, not only for DENV serotypes, but also for other flaviviruses and viral hemorrhagic fevers-associated viruses. We showed how the RNA secondary structure can be used to categorise viruses, and even to further classify them based on the interaction with proteins. We envision that these approaches can be used to further classify and characterise these complex viruses.

TI  - Context-dependent and variable effects of endohyphal bacteria on interactions between fungi and seeds
T2  - FUNGAL ECOLOGY
AB  - Plant-associated fungi often harbor endohyphal bacteria (EHB) that modulate fungal phenotypes. We quantified the effects of EHB on interactions between fungi and seeds of neotropical pioneer trees, which fungi colonize naturally in forest soil. Seeds were exposed to six fungal isolates that harbored EHB, and to clones of those fungi from which EHB were removed by antibiotic treatment. Seed colonization by fungi was evaluated for five tree species, and germination and viability were evaluated for three tree species. EHB influenced seed colonization by fungi in 5 of 30 fungus-tree species combinations, but the magnitude of their effects was small and the direction of effects depended upon fungal isolate-tree species pairs. EHB had rare and context-dependent effects on seed germination and viability, but their effects were strong when observed. Rare but powerful effects of EHB on fungal interactions with seeds highlight important and context-dependent aspects of plant and fungal ecology.

TI  - Why ant pollination is rare: new evidence and implications of the antibiotic hypothesis
T2  - ARTHROPOD-PLANT INTERACTIONS
AB  - The antibiotic hypothesis proposes that ant pollination is rare at least in part because the cuticular antimicrobial secretions of ants are toxic to pollen grains. We tested this hypothesis by comparing the effects of ants and bees on pollen in two regions: a tropical rainforest in Amazonian Peru and temperate forests and old fields in Canada. We found support for three predictions that follow from the antibiotic hypothesis. (1) For all 10 ant and 11 plant species in our study, contact with ants significantly reduced pollen germination, confirming the generality of this effect. (2) Contact with two bee species did not have similar effects; pollen exposed to bees germinated as well as control pollen. (3) Consistent with the presumed greater abundance of entomopathogens in the tropics, which may have selected for stronger antibiotic secretions in tropical ants, tropical ants had more negative effects on pollen than temperate ants. We speculate that the antibiotic hypothesis contributes not only to the rarity but also to the biogeography of ant pollination, and we discuss whether the negative effects of ants on pollen have resulted in selection for floral defenses against ants.

TI  - Observing tidal and storm generated wave height impact on groundwater levels in a tropical delta (the Sundarbans)
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
AB  - Groundwater level (GWL) of coastal aquifers are strongly influenced by the ocean tide at sub-daily to seasonal scale. Similarly, GWL are influenced by storm induced ocean wave surge lasting few hours to a day. There has not been a detailed study on the conjunctive impact of such tidal and storm waves on coastal groundwater and its vulnerability. Through our coastal and field-laboratory observations at one of the world's most extreme climate affected regions, the Ganges river mega-delta, we delineate the influence of ocean wave surge impacts on the shallow (<24 m below ground level [m bgl]) and deep (115 m bgl) aquifers GWL. Our study on the multi-layered delta-front aquifers, adjoining the tropical BoB shows that the high-temporal resolution GWL fluctuation due to wave surges are instantaneous, rapid and synchronous at all depths of the aquifers. The potential rise of ocean waves caused by tropical cyclone Bulbul (November 2019) significantly increases the GWL, both in shallow and deeper aquifer. Using multivariate statistics and machine learning techniques, we have attempted to quantify the rise of GWL during each of the ocean wave surge event. The model shows good predictability for deeper groundwater, however it is unable to quantify the shallower GWL of each of the ocean wave surge during storm events. Such phenomenon indicates aquifer vulnerability, thereby posing an emerging threat to drinking water availability to millions of groundwater-dependent inhabitants in coastal areas, globally, which may rapidly intensify with increasing rates of tropical cyclones and sea level rise in recent times and impending future.

TI  - The scope of hunter-gatherer ethnomedicine
T2  - SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE
AB  - We examined the cosmology and ethnomedical beliefs of the Penan hunter-gatherers of Brunei Darussalam on the island of Borneo. Our results suggest that they maintain a medical system that is limited in scope and detail compared to neighboring swidden rice cultivators. The Penan recognize the existence of a nearly infinite array of mostly unnamed, animist spirits that are loosely connected with the misfortunes of humans. Although taboo violation is believed to be associated with illness, there is no strict corpus of belief in respect to spirit placation. Dream readers offer advice on the causes of illness episodes, but their recommendations are neither necessarily accepted nor rigidly enforced. At least prior to permanent settlement, the Penan appear to have suffered from a limited suite of illnesses and treated them with a short list of plant medicines.
   We suggest that the Penans' abbreviated ethnomedical system is a function of their foraging subsistence mode. With a low population density, lack of domesticated livestock and fowl, and nomadic lifestyle, the Penan are unlikely to have suffered from the array of crowd and lifestyle diseases that afflict settled, agricultural societies. We hypothesize that the Penans' uncomplicated ethnomedical system, and perhaps that of other nomadic, tropical forest foraging groups, is consistent with the relatively disease-fret conditions inherent to this subsistence lifestyle.

TI  - Reproductive biology of the dioecious understorey palm <i>Chamaedorea radicalis</i> in a Mexican cloud forest:: pollination vector, flowering phenology and female fecundity
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY
AB  - The reproductive biology of the dioecious understorey palm Chamaedorea radicalis was investigated in order to identify the primary pollen vector and quantify the relationship between female fecundity and local neighbourhood sexual composition. The study was conducted in a montane mesophyll forest within the El Cielo Biosphere Reserve, Tamaulipas, Mexico. The species is considered vulnerable in Mexico and there are concerns about the sustainability of leaf harvest. We determined that wind is the primary pollen vector, based both on floral and pollen morphological characters, and on a pollinator exclosure experiment. Successful wind pollination of this understorey palm was facilitated by the extended flowering period of males, which allows one male to be a source of pollen to receptive females for as long as a month. The number of flowers and fruits borne on a female were dependent on female size, however. no size parameter correlated well with fruit set. Fruit set was also not dependent on local sexual composition, male density or distance to the nearest male, suggesting that in this study area female reproductive success is not limited by the availability of pollen.

TI  - Quinolone Resistance in Absence of Selective Pressure: The Experience of a Very Remote Community in the Amazon Forest
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background: Quinolones are potent broad-spectrum bactericidal agents increasingly employed also in resource-limited countries. Resistance to quinolones is an increasing problem, known to be strongly associated with quinolone exposure. We report on the emergence of quinolone resistance in a very remote community in the Amazon forest, where quinolones have never been used and quinolone resistance was absent in 2002.
   Methods: The community exhibited a considerable level of geographical isolation, limited contact with the exterior and minimal antibiotic use (not including quinolones). In December 2009, fecal carriage of antibiotic resistant Escherichia coli was investigated in 120 of the 140 inhabitants, and in 48 animals reared in the community. All fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates were genotyped and characterized for the mechanisms of plasmid-and chromosomal-mediated quinolone resistance.
   Principal Findings: Despite the characteristics of the community remained substantially unchanged during the period 2002-2009, carriage of quinolone-resistant E. coli was found to be common in 2009 both in humans (45% nalidixic acid, 14% ciprofloxacin) and animals (54% nalidixic acid, 23% ciprofloxacin). Ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates of human and animal origin showed multidrug resistance phenotypes, a high level of genetic heterogeneity, and a combination of GyrA (Ser83Leu and Asp87Asn) and ParC (Ser80Ile) substitutions commonly observed in fluoroquinolone-resistant clinical isolates of E. coli.
   Conclusions: Remoteness and absence of antibiotic selective pressure did not protect the community from the remarkable emergence of quinolone resistance in E. coli. Introduction of the resistant strains from antibiotic-exposed settings is the most likely source, while persistence and dissemination in the absence of quinolone exposure is likely mostly related with poor sanitation. Interventions aimed at reducing the spreading of resistant isolates (by improving sanitation and water/food safety) are urgently needed to preserve the efficacy of quinolones in resource-limited countries, as control strategies based only on antibiotic restriction policies are unlikely to succeed in those settings.

TI  - Distribution of tungiasis in latin America: Identification of areas for potential disease transmission using an ecological niche model
T2  - LANCET REGIONAL HEALTH-AMERICAS
AB  - Background Tungiasis is a neglected tropical disease (NTD) found in Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America. Despite the high frequency in marginalized populations, little information is available on the geography and estimates of the population at risk in endemic regions. Here we used a geostatistical model to map the potential geographic distribution of areas suitable for tungiasis transmission in Latin America and estimated the at-risk population.
   Methods We developed an ecological niche model (ENM) using tungiasis occurrence records and remotely sensed environmental and socioeconomic data. The potential geographic distribution was then compared to the current population distribution of the region to derive the total population living in urban and rural areas.
   Findings We identified a total of 138 records of occurrences of tungiasis in Latin America, ranging from Mexico to Argentina; 27 reports were not included in the modeling, due to missing detailed geographic information. The occurrences with detailed geographic information (n = 112) included 17 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. The locations were in environments that primarily consisted of forests (29%), croplands (16 center dot 5%), and shrublands (10 center dot 9%). We predicted environmentally suitable areas for tungiasis transmission in 45 countries. The estimated human population living in these areas is 450,546,547 with urban centers accounting for 347,007,103 and rural areas 103,539,444. Countries with significant ecological suitability and documented occurrences include Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Argentina, Bolivia, Ecuador, French Guyana, Guatemala, Haiti, Paraguay, Peru, Trinidad and Tobago, and Venezuela.
   Interpretation This is the first study mapping the potential distribution of tungiasis in Latin America, evidencing the need for population-based studies and elaboration of integrated control measures.

TI  - Short-distance pollen dispersal by bats in an urban setting: monitoring the movement of a vertebrate pollinator through fluorescent dyes
T2  - URBAN ECOSYSTEMS
AB  - Pollen dispersal in tropical seed plants is established mainly by biotic vectors, both in intact and fragmented environments. In urban landscapes, the segregation of natural remnants by an artificial matrix can reduce pollinator foraging efficiency. It is unknown how nectarivorous bats, regarded as long-distance pollen dispersers, respond to such habitat structure combined with city-related factors. Here, we investigated the pollen dispersal pattern between spatially segregated individuals of the bat-pollinated Bignoniaceae Crescentia cujete within an urban environment. From 2015 to 2017, we assessed their spatiotemporal structure, breeding system and annual fruit set in order to relate these factors to the bat activity in the region. We employed fluorescent dyes as pollen analogues to infer the role of bats in pollen flow. Adding to the low density of individuals, we found a low daily flower emission and low flowering synchrony (S = 0,092), all of which are traits that favor outcrossing. Individuals were distributed in two distant groups (>600 m), with no occurrence of dye flow between them. In contrast, flow within the same individual was intense, which points toward bats' territorial behavior. C. cujete is self-compatible, but not autogamous; therefore, despite few outcross events, bats could be ensuring the plant's year-round fruit production mainly through self-pollination. Our findings show restricted bat foraging extent, which affects overall pollen dispersal distance and population connectivity. These results can be extrapolated to natural metapopulations inserted in an urban matrix and serve as a groundwork for studying directly the effect of city-related factors on pollinator behavior.

TI  - Are we hunting bats to extinction? Worldwide patterns of hunting risk in bats are driven by species ecology and regional economics
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Bats are routinely neglected in conservation, often regarded as uncharismatic and constantly maligned despite their provision of economic and ecosystem services. Yet many species are threatened, and while the loss of roosting and foraging habitat has been explored, the impacts of hunting on species survival are less well un-derstood. Here, we analysed the hunting risk of 1320 bat species (of 1400 known) from around the world and explored the association between ecological traits and socioeconomic variables. Globally, at least 19 % of species are threatened by hunting. Large-bodied bats with narrow distributions are at increased risk of hunting, particularly in tropical regions. Multiple threats, such as habitat loss and modification, are likely to exacerbate the pressures experienced by hunted species. Furthermore, accessibility to bat habitats and low-income drive bat hunting in developing countries. With the global economic recession and the need for economic recovery following the pandemic, hunters may rely more on wildlife for subsistence and pose a threat to both biodiversity and public health. Achieving the balance between economics and conserving biodiversity is challenging due to socioeconomic factors, and the complex interplay of different forms of threat. Therefore, interventions to reduce bat hunting activities should include greater investment to facilitate sustainable livelihood development in the rural economy, and elevating public knowledge about bat ecosystem services, and their potential role in the transmission of zoonotic diseases.

TI  - Ecology of <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i> and <i>Listeria</i> species in India: the occurrence, resistance to biocides, genomic landscape and biocontrol
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Listeria monocytogenes, the causative agent of listeriosis, has been implicated in increasing foodborne outbreaks worldwide. The disease is manifested in various forms ranging from severe sepsis in immune-compromised individuals, febrile gastroenteritis, still birth, abortions and meningoencephalitis. In India, data from studies on the detection and molecular epidemiological analysis of L. monocytogenes are only recently emerging. The presence of Listeria in different ecological niches has been recorded from India, including foods, soil, vegetables, mangrove swamps, seafood, freshwater fishes, clinical cases, and also insects. The organism has also been isolated from women with spontaneous abortions, miscarriage or recurrent obstetric history, aborted foetuses, animal clinical cases and wildlife samples. A novel species of Listeria has also been characterized. Listeria monocytogenes strains isolated from clinical, environmental, and foods showed biofilm-forming abilities. Listeria monocytogenes serotype 4b isolates of ST328, a predominant and unique ST observed in India, was repeatedly isolated from different sources, times, and geographical locations. Here, we reviewed the occurrence of Listeria in different sources in India, its resistance to biocides, and provide epidemiological analysis on its genomic landscape.

TI  - Threats to a rainforest carnivore community: A multi-year assessment of occupancy and co-occurrence in Madagascar
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Protected areas (PA) aim to eliminate many of the threats that species face on the greater landscape. In the last three decades, PA's have expanded considerably; however, quantitative assessments of how well they have mitigated threats to habitat and biodiversity are very limited. Habitat bordering PA's and the wildlife that use it are threatened by a wide-range of anthropogenic pressures (e.g., edge effects, fragmentation, and introduced predators) and this situation is particularly acute for low-density, poorly studied carnivore communities. From 2010 to 2015, we photographically sampled within (contiguous forest) and bordering (degraded, fragmented forest) a UNESCO World Heritage rainforest PA in Madagascar - Ranomafana National Park (RNP). We investigated the effects of invasive predators, local people presence, and habitat quality on the endemic rainforest carnivore community using static, dynamic, and co-occurrence models. We found native carnivores to be absent or have a low probability of occurrence in degraded forest bordering the PA, while local people and dogs (Canis familiaris) had high occurrence. Madagascar's largest endemic carnivore, the fosa (Cryptoprocta ferox) and the much smaller ring-tailed vontsira (Galidia elegans), occurrence in RNP declined rapidly over six years; their strong co-occurrence with dogs suggests interspecific competition, direct aggression/mortality, or disease as the cause. We highlight the dangers posed to biodiversity, particularly carnivores, from anthropogenic pressures bordering PA's and present recommendations to address increased human and dog activity, including programs to control dogs and their impact on biodiversity.

TI  - Sylvatic cycles of arboviruses in non-human primates
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
AB  - Arboviruses infecting people primarily exist in urban transmission cycles involving urban mosquitoes in densely populated tropical regions. For dengue, chikungunya, Zika and yellow fever viruses, sylvatic (forest) transmission cycles also exist in some regions and involve non-human primates and forest-dwelling mosquitoes. Here we review the investigation methods and available data on sylvatic cycles involving non-human primates and dengue, chikungunya, Zika and yellow fever viruses in Africa, dengue viruses in Asia and yellow fever virus in the Americas. We also present current putative data that Mayaro, o'nyong'nyong, Oropouche, Spondweni and Lumbo viruses exist in sylvatic cycles.

TI  - GENETIC EROSION IN WILD POPULATIONS MAKES RESISTANCE TO A PATHOGEN MORE COSTLY
T2  - EVOLUTION
AB  - Populations that have suffered from genetic erosion are expected to exhibit reduced average trait values or decreased variation in adaptive traits when experiencing periodic or emergent stressors such as infectious disease. Genetic erosion may consequentially modify the ability of a potential host population to cope with infectious disease emergence. We experimentally investigate this relationship between genetic variability and host response to exposure to an infectious agent both in terms of susceptibility to infection and indirect parasite-mediated responses that also impact fitness. We hypothesized that the deleterious consequences of exposure to the pathogen (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis) would be more severe for tadpoles descended from European treefrog (Hyla arborea) populations lacking genetic variability. Although all exposed tadpoles lacked detectable infection, we detected this relationship for some indirect host responses, predominantly in genetically depleted animals, as well as an interaction between genetic variability and pathogen dose on life span during the postmetamorphic period. Lack of infection and a decreased mass and postmetamorphic life span in low genetic diversity tadpoles lead us to conclude that genetic erosion, while not affecting the ability to mount effective resistance strategies, also erodes the capacity to invest in resistance, increased tadpole growth rate, and metamorphosis relatively simultaneously.

TI  - Seasonal genetic partitioning in the neotropical malaria vector, <i>Anopheles darlingi</i>
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
AB  - Background: Anopheles darlingi is the main malaria mosquito vector in the Amazonia region. In spite of being considered a riverine, forest-dwelling species, this mosquito is becoming more abundant in peri-urban areas, increasing malaria risk. This has been associated with human-driven environmental changes such as deforestation.
   Methods: Microsatellites were used to characterize A. darlingi from seven localities along the Madeira River, Rondonia (Brazil), collected in the early and late periods of the rainy season.
   Results: Two genetically distinct subpopulations were detected: one (subpopulation A) was associated with the late rainfall period and seems to be ecologically closer to the typical forest A. darlingi; the other (subpopulation B) was associated with the early rainfall period and is probably more adapted to drier conditions by exploiting permanent anthropogenic breeding sites. Results suggest also a pattern of asymmetric introgression, with more subpopulation A alleles introgressed into subpopulation B. Both subpopulations (and admixed mosquitoes) presented similar malaria infection rates, highlighting the potential for perennial malaria transmission in the region.
   Conclusions: The co-occurrence of two genetically distinct subpopulations of A. darlingi adapted to different periods of rainfall may promote a more perennial transmission of malaria throughout the year. These findings, in a context of strong environmental impact due to deforestation and dam construction, have serious implications for malaria epidemiology and control in the Amazonian region.

TI  - Viral hemorrhagic fever in the tropics: Report from the task force on tropical diseases by the World Federation of Societies of Intensive and Critical Care Medicine
T2  - JOURNAL OF CRITICAL CARE
AB  - Viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs) are a group of illnesses caused by four families of viruses namely Arenaviruses, Filoviruses, Bunyaviruses, and Flaviviruses. Humans are not the natural reservoir for any of these organisms and acquire the disease through vectors from animal reservoirs. In some conditions human to human transmission is possible increasing the risk to healthy individuals in the vicinity, more so to Health Care Workers (HCW). The pathogenesis of VHF, though poorly understood, varies according to the viruses involved. The resultant microvascular damage leads to increased vascular permeability, organ dysfunction and even death. The management is generally supportive but antiviral agents are of benefit in certain circumstances. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Effects of natural and socioeconomic factors on dengue transmission in two cities of China from 2006 to 2017
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Dengue fever (DF) is a common and rapidly spreading vector-borne viral disease in tropical and subtropical regions. In recent years, in China, DF still poses an increasing threat to public health in many cities; but the incidence shows significant spatiotemporal differences. The purpose of this study was to identify the key factors affecting the spatial and temporal distribution of DF. We collected natural environmental and socio-economic data for two adjacent cities, Guangzhou (73 variables) and Foshan (71 variables), with the most DF cases in China. We performed random forest modelling to rank the factors according to their level of importance, and used negative binomial regression analysis to compare the risk factors between outbreak years and non-outbreak years. The natural environmental factors contributing to DF incidence for Guangzhou were temperature (relative risk (RR) = 18.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 3.11-113.67), humidity (RR = 1.85, 95% CI = 1.17-2.90) and green area (RR = 12.11, 95% CI = 6.14-55.50), and for Foshan was forest coverage (RR = 5.83, 95% CI = 2.72-12.45). Socio-economic impact were shown in Guangzhou with foreign visitor (RR = 1.18, 95% CI = 1.05-1.34) and oversea air passenger transport (RR = 7.34, 95% CI = 2.26-23.86); in Foshan, with oversea tourism (RR = 1.65, 95% CI = 1.34-2.04); and in Guangzhou-Foshan, with the development of intercity metro (RR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.10-1.44). The difference between the two cities was the greater impact of the foreign visitor, green spaces and climate factor on DF in Guangzhou; the impact of the construction of intercity metro; and the more significant impact of oversea tourism on DF in Foshan. Our results suggest meaningful clues to public health authorities implementing joint interventions on DF prevention and early warning, to increase health education on DF prevention for international visitors and oversea travelers, and cross-city metro passengers; using rapid body temperature detection in public places such as airports, metros and parks can help detect cases early.<bold> </bold>

TI  - Immuno-biology of Chikungunya and implications for disease intervention
T2  - MICROBES AND INFECTION
AB  - The re-emergence of Chikungunya fever, an old tropical infectious disease with new characteristics represents a major public health problem with severe social and economic burdens globally. Though Chikungunya has previously been known as a relatively benign disease, its recent re-emergence has caused considerable morbidity with even some cases of fatality. The aggressive waves of the disease are suspected to be due to changes in the virus as well as the vector which makes it appear like a new form of the disease. The study of the human immune response will be crucial in understanding some features of the disease. This review discusses what is currently known on the immuno-biology of Chikungunya and areas that will be important for the development of immune-based antiviral control strategies.

TI  - Evaluation of Wild Foods for Responsible Human Consumption and Sustainable Use of Natural Resources
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Traditional consumption of plants, fungi and wild animals constitutes a reality for the feeding of diverse human groups in different tropical territories of the world. In this regard, there are two views within the academic community: (1) those who defend the importance of the traditional consumption for family food security in rural areas, especially in tropical countries with emerging development; and (2) those who affirm their inconvenience as they are considered vectors of rapidly spreading diseases worldwide. A systematic literature review and an Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) with experts were carried out to identify the contributing criteria and dimensions in Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) that help evaluate the potential of wild foods for responsible consumption in terms of human health and nature conservation. Four dimensions were identified. The first three are: (1) importance of food for the community that consumes it (w = 0.31); (2) nutritional value and risks for human health (w = 0.28) and (3) sustainability of the local use of wild food model (w = 0.27). These three obtained similar integrated relative weights, which suggests the possible balanced importance in the formulation of multidisciplinary methods for estimating the potential of wild foods. The fourth identified dimension is: (4) transformation techniques for turning wild foods into products with commercial potential, obtained an integrated relative weight of 0.14, which, although is lower than the other three, still contributes to the potential of this type of food. The study found ten assessment criteria to evaluate the identified dimensions, constituting a starting point to estimate the potential of this type of food.

TI  - Coverage and Effectiveness of Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD) Vaccine in Karnataka, South India, 2005-10
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background: Kyasanur forest disease (KFD), a tick-borne viral disease with hemorrhagic manifestations, is localised in five districts of Karnataka state, India. Annual rounds of vaccination using formalin inactivated tissue-culture vaccine have been conducted in the region since 1990. Two doses of vaccine are administered to individuals aged 7-65 years at an interval of one month followed by periodic boosters after 6-9 months. In spite of high effectiveness of the vaccine reported in earlier studies, KFD cases among vaccinated individuals have been recently reported. We analysed KFD vaccination and case surveillance data from 2005 to 2010.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We calculated KFD incidence among vaccinated and unvaccinated populations and computed the relative risk and vaccine effectiveness. During 2005-2010, a total of 343,256 individuals were eligible for KFD vaccination (details of vaccination for 2008 were not available). Of these, 52% did not receive any vaccine while 36% had received two doses and a booster. Of the 168 laboratory-confirmed KFD cases reported during this 5-year period, 134 (80%) were unvaccinated, nine each had received one and two doses respectively while 16 had received a booster during the pre-transmission season. The relative risks of disease following one, two and booster doses of vaccine were 1.06 (95% CI = 0.542.1), 0.38 (95% CI = 0.19-0.74) and 0.17 (95% CI = 0.10-0.29) respectively. The effectiveness of the vaccine was 62.4% (95% CI = 26.1-80.8) among those who received two doses and 82.9% (95% CI = 71.3-89.8) for those who received two doses followed by a booster dose as compared to the unvaccinated individuals.
   Conclusions: Coverage of KFD vaccine in the study area was low. Observed effectiveness of the KFD vaccine was lower as compared to the earlier reports, especially after a single dose administration. Systematic efforts are needed to increase the vaccine coverage and identify the reasons for lower effectiveness of the vaccine in the region.

TI  - Co-infection of tick-borne bacterial pathogens in ticks in Inner Mongolia, China
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Author summaryTicks carry and transmit a variety of pathogens, and their host animals are widely distributed in nature with diverse epidemic links, so that several tick-borne diseases can coexist in the same foci, and even one type of tick or one tick can carry a variety of pathogens at the same time, these factors pose a serious public health threat. In our study, we summarized the regional differences in tick infection and co-infection rates outcomes in all Inner Mongolia of China, and found that pathogen diversity varied with ecogeographic differences such as gobi desert, grassland and forest. A variety of tick-borne bacterial pathogens were identified, with an overall high prevalence rate (61.4% of ticks infected), among infected ticks, 24.3% were co-infected. An unexpected high infection and co-infection rates of ticks collected from the Forest region of eastern Inner Mongolia (sample area 1) was detected. Geographical differences affect tick species and tick-borne pathogens, so the potential threat to humans or animals is also different. In particular, that that knowledge of co-infections is important as they do not just present diagnostic challenges, but the pathogens might play different roles within their respective hosts, thus modulating disease severity.
   Tick-borne infectious diseases pose a serious health threat in certain regions of the world. Emerging infectious diseases caused by novel tick-borne pathogens have been reported that are causing particular concern. Several tick-borne diseases often coexist in the same foci, and a single vector tick can transmit two or more pathogens at the same time, which greatly increases the probability of co-infection in host animals and humans and can lead to an epidemic of tick-borne disease. The lack of epidemiological data and information on the specific clinical symptoms related to co-infection with tick-borne pathogens means that it is not currently possible to accurately and rapidly distinguish between a single pathogen infection and co-infection with multiple pathogens, which can have serious consequences. Inner Mongolia in the north of China is endemic for tick-borne infectious diseases, especially in the eastern forest region. Previous studies have found that more than 10% of co-infections were in host-seeking ticks. However, the lack of data on the specific types of co-infection with pathogens makes clinical treatment difficult. In our study, we present data on the co-infection types and the differences in co-infection among different ecological regions through genetic analysis of tick samples collected throughout Inner Mongolia. Our findings may aid clinicians in the diagnosis of concomitant tick-borne infectious diseases.

AB  - Background
   Bacillus cereus biovar anthracis (Bcbva) is an emergent bacterium closely related to Bacillus anthracis, the etiological agent of anthrax. The latter has a worldwide distribution and usually causes infectious disease in mammals associated with savanna ecosystems. Bcbva was identified in humid tropical forests of Cote d'Ivoire in 2001. Here, we characterize the potential geographic distributions of Bcbva in West Africa and B. anthracis in sub-Saharan Africa using an ecological niche modeling approach.
   Methodology/Principal findings
   Georeferenced occurrence data for B. anthracis and Bcbva were obtained from public data repositories and the scientific literature. Combinations of temperature, humidity, vegetation greenness, and soils values served as environmental variables in model calibrations. To predict the potential distribution of suitable environments for each pathogen across the study region, parameter values derived from the median of 10 replicates of the best-performing model for each pathogen were used. We found suitable environments predicted for B. anthracis across areas of confirmed and suspected anthrax activity in sub-Saharan Africa, including an east-west corridor from Ethiopia to Sierra Leone in the Sahel region and multiple areas in eastern, central, and southern Africa. The study area for Bcbva was restricted to West and Central Africa to reflect areas that have likely been accessible to Bcbva by dispersal. Model predicted values indicated potential suitable environments within humid forested environments. Background similarity tests in geographic space indicated statistical support to reject the null hypothesis of similarity when comparing environments associated with B. anthracis to those of Bcbva and when comparing humidity values and soils values individually. We failed to reject the null hypothesis of similarity when comparing environments associated with Bcbva to those of B. anthracis, suggesting that additional investigation is needed to provide a more robust characterization of the Bcbva niche.
   Author summary
   Bacillus cereus biovar anthracis (Bcbva) is an emergent pathogen causing anthrax in West and Central African countries. It shares multiple bacteriological and genomic characteristics with Bacillus anthracis, the gram-positive bacterium causing anthrax in mammals worldwide. However, Bcbva has only been isolated in tropical humid forested environments in Africa; thus, we attempted to characterize its potential distribution and the differences with B. anthracis using an ecological niche modeling framework. According to our results, both pathogens are using different environments and their distribution looks complementary with B. anthracis occupying savanna-like environments and Bcbva occupying forested areas; further, we detected some level of overlap between the potential geographic distributions of B. anthracis and Bcbva, despite their lack of overlap in their current environmental space. This is the first time the potential distribution of Bcbva is addressed considering all the available spatial information on the pathogen occurrence available as of 2017. Although our Bcbva models are limited due to sample size, this exploration informs on areas that would likely be considered for further investigation of Bcbva outbreaks with special emphasis on areas where Bcbva and B. anthracis could co-exist.

TI  - A Stakeholder Analysis of Schistosomiasis Diagnostic Landscape in South-West Nigeria: Insights for Diagnostics Co-creation
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Background: Schistosomiasis, one of the neglected tropical diseases, is a water-based parasitic disease of public health importance. Currently, tests for Schistosoma haematobium infection either demonstrate poor specificity, are expensive or too laborious for use in endemic countries, creating a need for more sensitive, cheaper, and easy to use devices for the diagnosis of schistosomiasis. To ensure engagement during the process of device development; and effective acceptance and use after the introduction of diagnostics devices for S. haematobium, there is a need to involve stakeholders with varying power, interest, and stakes in device co-creation, as well as those relevant for later use situation in the diagnostic landscape. The main goal of this study is to identify and analyze relevant stakeholders for co-creation using a power-interest matrix.
   Materials and Methods: The study was based on an action research methodology using a case study approach. A contextual inquiry approach consisting of 2 stages: stakeholder identification and interview; and stakeholder analysis was used. The field part of the study was carried out in Oyo State, Nigeria using a multistage cluster purposive sampling technique based on the category of stakeholders to be interviewed predicated on the organizational structure within the state and communities. A mix of qualitative research techniques was used. Identified themes related to power and interest were mapped and analyzed.
   Results: We identified 17 characteristics of stakeholders across 7 categories of stakeholders important for schistosomiasis diagnostics. Most of the stakeholders were important for both the co-creation and adoption phase of the device development for diagnostics. However, not all stakeholders were relevant to co-creation. Key Stakeholders relevant for diagnostics co-creation demonstrated significant social power, organization power, and legitimate power bases. Most of the stakeholders showed significant interest in the device to be created.
   Discussion: The power and interest of these stakeholders reveal some insight into how each stakeholder may be engaged for both co-creation and device usage. The involvement of relevant actors who will also be important for co-creation and implementation, will simplify the engagement process for the critical stakeholders, increase the ability to manage the process, and increase diagnostic device acceptability.

TI  - Lyme Disease Risk Influences Human Settlement in the Wildland-Urban Interface: Evidence from a Longitudinal Analysis of Counties in the Northeastern United States
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - The expansion of human settlement into wildland areas, including forests in the eastern United States, has resulted in fragmented forest habitat that has been shown to drive higher entomological risk for Lyme disease. We investigated an alternative pathway between fragmentation and Lyme disease, namely whether increased risk of Lyme disease results in a reduced propensity to settle in high-risk areas at the interface of developed and undeveloped lands. We used longitudinal data analyses at the county level to determine whether Lyme disease incidence (LDI) influences the proportion of the population residing in the wildland-urban interface in 12 high LDI states in the eastern United States. We found robust evidence that a higher LDI reduces the proportion of a county's population residing in the wildland-urban interface in high-LDI states. This study provides some of the first evidence of human behavioral responses to Lyme disease risk via settlement decisions.

TI  - Insights into factors sustaining persistence of high malaria transmission in forested areas of sub-Saharan Africa: the case of Mvoua, South Cameroon
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
AB  - BackgroundIn Mvoua, a village situated in a forested area of Cameroon, recent studies have reported high prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum infection among the population. In order to understand factors that can sustain such a high malaria transmission, we investigated the biology of Anopheles vectors and its susceptibility to insecticides, as well as long-lasting insecticidal net (LLIN) coverage, use and bio-efficacy.MethodsA longitudinal entomological survey was conducted from July 2018 to April 2019. Adult mosquitoes were collected using the human landing catch (HLC) method and identified using morphological and molecular techniques. Anopheles gambiae (s.l.) larvae were sampled from several stagnant water pools throughout the village and reared to generate F1 adults. The presence of P. falciparum circumsporozoite antigen was detected in the heads and thoraces of mosquitoes collected as adults using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The insecticide susceptibility status of the local An. gambiae (s.l.) F1 population to the pyrethroid insecticides deltamethrin 0.5% and permethrin 0.75% was determined using World Health Organization-tube bioassays, while the frequency of the knockdown resistance (kdr) mutation was determined by PCR. Coverage, use and physical integrity of LLINs were assessed in households, then cone assays were used to test for their bio-efficacy on both the reference insecticide-susceptible Kisumu strain and on field F1 An. gambiae (s.l.)ResultsIn total, 110 Anopheles mosquitoes were collected, of which 59.1% were identified as Anopheles funestus (s.l.), 38.18% as An. gambiae (s.l.) and 2.72% as An. ziemanii. Anopheles funestus was the most abundant species except in the long rainy season, when An. gambiae (s.l.) predominated (65.8%). In the dry seasons, vectors were principally endophagous (76% of those collected indoors) while they tended to be exophagous (66% of those collected outdoors) in rainy seasons. High Plasmodium infection was observed in An. gambiae (s.l.) and An. funestus, with a circumsporozoitic rate of 14.29 and 10.77%, respectively. Anopheles gambiae (s.l.) was highly resistant to pyrethroid insecticides (mortality rates: 32% for permethrin and 5% for deltamethrin) and harbored the kdr-L1014F mutation at a high frequency (89.74%). Of the 80 households surveyed, only 47.69% had achieved universal coverage with LLNs. Around 70% of the LLINs sampled were in poor physical condition, with a proportionate hole index > 300. Of the ten LLNs tested, eight were effective against the An. gambiae reference insecticide-susceptible Kisumu strain, showing mortality rate of > 80%, while none of these LLINs were efficient against local An. gamabie (s.l.) populations (mortality rates<11.5%).ConclusionA combination of elevated P. falciparum infection in Anopheles vector populations, insufficient coverage and loss of effectiveness of LLINs due to physical degradation, as well as high resistance to pyrethroid insecticides is responsible for the persistence of high malaria transmission in forested rural area of Mvoua, Cameroon.

TI  - On the use of RADARSAT-1 for monitoring malaria risk in Kenya
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE THIRD INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON RETRIEVAL OF BIO- AND GEOPHYSICAL PARAMETERS FROM SAR DATA FOR LAND APPLICATIONS
CP  - 3rd International Symposium on Retrieval of Bio- and Geophysical Parameters from SAR Data for Land Applications
AB  - The incidence and spread of vector-borne infectious diseases are increasing concerns in many parts of the world. Earth observation techniques provide a recognised means for monitoring and mapping disease risk as well as correlating environmental indicators with various disease vectors. Because the areas most impacted by vector-borne disease are remote and not easily monitored using traditional, labour intensive survey techniques, high spatial and temporal coverage provided by spaceborne sensors allows for the investigation of large areas in a timely manner. However, since the majority of infectious diseases occur in tropical areas, one of the main barriers to earth observation techniques is persistent cloud-cover.
   Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) technology offers a solution to this problem by providing all-weather, day and night imaging capability. Based on SAR's sensitivity to target moisture conditions, sensors such as RADARSAT-1 can be readily used to map wetland and swampy areas that are conducive to functioning as aquatic larval habitats. Irrigation patterns, deforestation practises and the effects of local flooding can be monitored using SAR imagery, and related to potential disease vector abundance and proximity to populated areas.
   This paper discusses the contribution of C-band radar remote sensing technology to monitoring and mapping malaria. Preliminary results using RADARSAT-1 for identifying areas of high mosquito (Anopheles gambiae s.l.) abundance along the Kenya coast will be discussed. The authors consider the potential of RADARSAT-1 data based on SAR sensor characteristics and the preliminary results obtained. Further potential of spaceborne SAR data for monitoring vector-borne disease is discussed with respect to future advanced SAR sensors such as RADARSAT-2.

TI  - Demographic response of the Gambian Gerbil to seasonal changes in Savannah fallow fields
T2  - FOLIA OECOLOGICA
AB  - The Savannah gerbil, Gerbilliscus gambianus (Muridae: Gerbillinae) is important to the ecological relations of the dry grassland ecosystem of West Africa, as well as, being a zoonotic agent of human diseases and potential crop pest. We examined the impact of seasonal changes on the population dynamics of G. gambianus in northern Nigeria, by completing population estimates using capture-mark-recapture (CMR) and indirect population density indices (PDI) methods. The latter included fecal pellet counts and limited spotlightening. During 1990-1992 we collected both CMR and PDI data, and established their relationship by regression, thus calibrating the PDI values to CMR estimator. We also completed a separate, PDI only, study during 2015-2017, and estimated monthly densities indirectly by toning the PDI values to population sizes in the CMR estimator. The lowest declines (<20 gerbils ha(-1)) were in mid rains (July-August), and highest increases (>90 gerbils ha(-1)) were after the rains (October-January). Seasonal effects on densities were significant during 1990-1992 but not during 2015-2017. There were improved survival rates for both adults (0.95) and young (0.83), adult capture probability (0.56), and mean monthly recruitment of young (23) after the rains. There was no significant change in the overall population dynamic pattern of G. gambianus over a 25-year period. Because G. gambianus did not maintain colonies inside farmlands cultivated by rain or irrigation, and its tendency for large population drops in mid-rains, we are in doubt of its potential as crop pest in northern Nigeria.

TI  - Responses of the Serengeti avifauna to long-term change in the environment
T2  - OSTRICH
AB  - In this paper we examine how climate change interacts with other disturbances to alter the functioning of a tropical ecosystem, the Serengeti in Tanzania. Tropical Africa has increasing temperatures and changes in rainfall. Long-term data have shown how the avifauna responds to the interaction of environmental change with other disturbances: (1) habitat modification through agriculture by limiting endemic species and top trophic levels. Rare species are lost so this is a problem for conservation. Top trophic levels are lost and the lack of predators then releases pests. This is a problem for natural resource management. (2) Disease and hunting cause slow change in the species complex. This can alter community dynamics depending on which species enter or leave. (3) Habitat fragmentation or decay can cause slow change. When this reaches a threshold there may be rapid change in the species composition causing multiple states. One lesson is that present-day ecosystem states and trends can only be understood in the context of past historical events. Another is that all systems change so this requires a new approach to conservation. Within protected areas, new boundaries or new areas will be required. Outside rewilding is required to support more biodiversity.

TI  - Epidemiology and Control of Rabies in Cattle and Equines in Rondônia State, a Brazilian's Legal Amazon Area
T2  - ANIMALS
AB  - Simple Summary: Rabies is a fatal zoonotic disease and a significant cause of economic losses in cattle and equine farms located in South America. In this continent, it is primarily transmitted to these hosts through bites of the hematophagous bat Desmodus rotundus. This survey investigated the presence of rabies in cattle and equines in the state of Rondonia, situated in the Brazilian's Legal Amazon region, spanning from 2002 to 2021. The study correlated these findings with the preventive measures implemented by the local health agency (IDARON) for rabies management. Over this timeframe, there were 201 reported cases in cattle and 23 in horses. Both herbivores exhibited a declining trend in rabies incidences. No specific within-year patterns in rabies occurrence was identified, and there were variations in epidemic periods. The reduction in rabies incidence risk among cattle and horses was attributed to the ratio of treated bats and the sale of vaccines in the area while, on the other hand, the number of educational printed materials contributed to the increasing the incidence. Despite the diminishing trend of rabies in this Amazon Rainforest region, which can be attributed to the efforts of the animal health agency, the disease remains endemic, necessitating ongoing surveillance and prophylactic strategies for its control. Rabies is a fatal neglected tropical zoonosis, and its significance for domestic herbivores in the rural cycle is probably associated with rainforest deforestation, livestock, and agricultural expansion. This epidemiological survey aimed to study the occurrence of rabies in bovines and equines in the state of Rondonia, located in the Brazilian's Legal Amazon, between the years 2002 and 2021, correlating these findings with the prophylactic strategies adopted by the local sanitary agency for rabies control. During this period, 201 cases were observed in bovines and 23 in equines. A downward trend in rabies incidence was observed for both domestic herbivores. Rabies did not show a higher occurrence in any specific time of the year, and epidemic periods varied during some years for bovines and equines. Using the Generalized estimating equations (GEE) method, a multiple model approach was obtained with the explanatory variables significantly associated with the decrease in rabies incidence in cattle and horses during the study period: the ratio of treated bats and ratio of vaccine doses sold. Furthermore, the ratio of printed educative material was positively associated with rabies incidence. Despite a decreasing trend in rabies occurrences in this Amazon rainforest area, likely due to the actions taken by the animal sanitary agency, rabies remains endemic and requires monitoring, as well as prophylactic strategies to control this disease.

TI  - Patterns of Exposure of Carnivores to Selected Pathogens in the Betampona Natural Reserve Landscape, Madagascar
T2  - JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE DISEASES
AB  - Carnivores of Madagascar are at increased risk of extinction due to anthropogenic loss of habitat, hunting, and interactions with introduced carnivores. Interactions between introduced and native animals also present the potential for introduction of pathogens into new geographic areas or host species. Here, we provide serologic data regarding pathogen exposure of domestic and native carnivores from the Betampona Natural Reserve Landscape, a protected area in eastern Madagascar. For the Eupleridae, we found limited evidence of exposure to viruses from domestic animals but greater prevalence for Toxoplasma gondii (39%) and Leptospira interrogans (40%). We also evaluated the associations between the presence of antibodies to selected pathogens and the demographic and spatial variables. We showed that individual characteristics such as sex and species were associated with exposure to T. gondii but not to L. interrogans or canine parvovirus (CPV). Finally, we investigated the spatial structure of pathogen exposure in Betampona and found no evidence of spatial structuring, indicating the absence of hotspots and agent-free refugia for T. gondii, L. interrogans, and CPV in the protected area. Our results may be useful for assessing and monitoring disease risk and for formulating control strategies to minimize the negative impact of exotic species on the endemic carnivores of Madagascar.

TI  - Experimental infection of Australian brushtail possums, <i>Trichosurus vulpecula</i> (Phalangeridae: Marsupialia), with Ross River and Barmah Forest viruses by use of a natural mosquito vector system
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Brushtail possums, Trichosurus vulpecula Kerr, were experimentally infected with Ross River (RR) or Barmah Forest (BF) virus by Aedes vigilax (Skuse) mosquitoes. Eight of 10 animals exposed to RR virus developed neutralizing antibody, and 3 possums developed high viremia for < 48 hr after infection, sufficient to infect recipient mosquitoes. Two of 10 animals exposed to BF virus developed neutralizing antibody. Both infected possums maintained detectable neutralizing antibody to BF for at least 45 days after infection (log neutralization index > 2.0 at 45 days). Eight possums did not develop neutralizing antibody to BF despite exposure to infected mosquitoes. These results suggest that T. vulpecula may potentially act as a reservoir species for RR in urban areas. However, T. vulpecula infected with BF do not develop viremia sufficient to infect mosquitoes and are unlikely to be important hosts for BF.

TI  - Prevalence of simian malaria parasites in macaques of Singapore
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Author summary
   Malaria is one of the most important vector-borne diseases in the world. In Southeast Asia, the incidence of human malaria infections caused by simian malaria parasites that originate from macaques has been increasing in the last decade, possibly due to closer proximity between the macaque and human population as a result of deforestation. In Singapore, urbanization and change in land use have resulted in closer proximity and interactions between macaques and the general human population. In order to assess the risk of potential simian malaria zoonosis, 1039 macaques' blood samples were screened in this study for simian malaria parasites. Our results showed that simian malaria parasites were only detected in macaques living deep in the forest within the military protected zone, while macaques living close to human habitations are malaria-free. This study illustrated a low risk of zoonotic transmission of simian malaria parasites to the general population in Singapore.
   Plasmodium knowlesi is a simian malaria parasite currently recognized as the fifth causative agent of human malaria. Recently, naturally acquired P. cynomolgi infection in humans was also detected in Southeast Asia. The main reservoir of both parasites is the long-tailed and pig-tailed macaques, which are indigenous in this region. Due to increased urbanization and changes in land use, there has been greater proximity and interaction between the long-tailed macaques and the general population in Singapore. As such, this study aims to determine the prevalence of simian malaria parasites in local macaques to assess the risk of zoonosis to the general human population. Screening for the presence of malaria parasites was conducted on blood samples from 660 peridomestic macaques collected between Jan 2008 and Mar 2017, and 379 wild macaques collected between Mar 2009 and Mar 2017, using a Pan-Plasmodium-genus specific PCR. Positive samples were then screened using a simian Plasmodium species-specific nested PCR assay to identify the species of parasites (P. knowlesi, P. coatneyi, P. fieldi, P. cynomolgi, and P. inui) present. All the peridomestic macaques sampled were tested negative for malaria, while 80.5% of the 379 wild macaques were infected. All five simian Plasmodium species were detected; P. cynomolgi being the most prevalent (71.5%), followed by P. knowlesi (47.5%), P. inui (42.0%), P. fieldi (32.5%), and P. coatneyi (28.5%). Co-infection with multiple species of Plasmodium parasites was also observed. The study revealed that Singapore's wild long-tailed macaques are natural hosts of the five simian malaria parasite species, while no malaria was detected in all peridomestic macaques tested. Therefore, the risk of simian malaria transmission to the general human population is concluded to be low. However, this can be better demonstrated with the incrimination of the vectors of simian malaria parasites in Singapore.

T2  - MYCOTAXON
AB  - During a study on the fungal endophytic associations with some trees of the secondary forest of El Eden Ecological Reserve located in the northeastern Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico, a new fungal species was isolated as an endophyte of a tree named chakah, chachah, or hukup (Bursera simaruba) by indigenous Mayas. This fungus is characterized by producing a strong musty odor and absence of reproductive structures. Cultures of this fungus on PDA form a whitish, flocculose colony with an uncolored reverse and a mycelium that grows slowly. Scanning electron microscopy photographs showed in aerial and submerged mycelium the early formation of unique intercalary swollen, thin-walled, rugulose hyphae. Based on morphological and DNA sequence analyses, the Mexican isolate is a member of the Xylariales with high similarity to Muscodor albus and the related species Muscodor vitigenus, but with distinct differences that is hens described and illustrated as Muscodor yucatanensis sp. nov.

TI  - Ecological aspects of mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) in the gallery forest of Brasilia National Park, Brazil, with an emphasis on potential vectors of yellow fever
T2  - REVISTA DA SOCIEDADE BRASILEIRA DE MEDICINA TROPICAL
AB  - Introduction: We analyzed the vertical and monthly distributions of culicid species in the gallery forest of Brasilia National Park, with an emphasis on the potential vectors of yellow fever (YF). Methods: Between September 2010 and August 2011, mosquitoes were captured on the ground and in the canopy of the forest for five consecutive days per month, from nine to 15 hours. The mosquitoes were examined to verify natural infection with flaviviruses by isolation in Aedes albopictus Skuse, 1864 cells followed by indirect immunofluorescence. Results: We identified 2,677 culicids distributed in 29 species. Most of the mosquitoes were captured at ground level (69%) during the rainy season (86%). The most abundant species were Sabethes (Sabethes) albiprivus Theobald, 1903; Limatus durhamii Theobald, 1901; Haemagogus (Conopostegus) leucocelaenus Dyar & Shannon, 1924;. Haemagogus (Haemagogus) janthinomys Dyar, 1921; Aedes (Ochlerotatus) scapularis Rondani, 1848; Psorophora (Janthinosoma) ferox Von Humboldt, 1819; and Aedes (Ochlerotatus) serratus Theobald, 1901. Haemagogus janthinomys, Limatus durhamii, Psorophora ferox, Aedes scapularis and Aedes serratus showed significant differences (p<0.05) in their habitat use. Haemagogus janthinomys was found more often in the canopy, unlike the other species. During the rainy season, the most abundant species were Sa. albiprivus, Haemagogus leucocelaenus and Haemagogus janthinomys. During the dry season, the potential YF vectors exhibited a very low frequency and abundance, except Aedes scapularis and Aedes serratus. No flavivirus was detected in the 2,677 examined mosquitoes. Conclusions: We recommend continued and systematic entomological monitoring in areas vulnerable to the transmission of YF in the Federal District of Brazil. Keywords: Flavivirus. Haemagogus. Mosquitoes. Vector ecology.Introduction: We analyzed the vertical and monthly distributions of culicid species in the gallery forest of Brasilia National Park, with an emphasis on the potential vectors of yellow fever (YF). Methods: Between September 2010 and August 2011, mosquitoes were captured on the ground and in the canopy of the forest for five consecutive days per month, from nine to 15 hours. The mosquitoes were examined to verify natural infection with flaviviruses by isolation in Aedes albopictus Skuse, 1864 cells followed by indirect immunofluorescence. Results: We identified 2,677 culicids distributed in 29 species. Most of the mosquitoes were captured at ground level (69%) during the rainy season (86%). The most abundant species were Sabethes (Sabethes) albiprivus Theobald, 1903; Limatus durhamii Theobald, 1901; Haemagogus (Conopostegus) leucocelaenus Dyar & Shannon, 1924;. Haemagogus (Haemagogus) janthinomys Dyar, 1921; Aedes (Ochlerotatus) scapularis Rondani, 1848; Psorophora (Janthinosoma) ferox Von Humboldt, 1819; and Aedes (Ochlerotatus) serratus Theobald, 1901. Haemagogus janthinomys, Limatus durhamii, Psorophora ferox, Aedes scapularis and Aedes serratus showed significant differences (p<0.05) in their habitat use. Haemagogus janthinomys was found more often in the canopy, unlike the other species. During the rainy season, the most abundant species were Sa. albiprivus, Haemagogus leucocelaenus and Haemagogus janthinomys. During the dry season, the potential YF vectors exhibited a very low frequency and abundance, except Aedes scapularis and Aedes serratus. No flavivirus was detected in the 2,677 examined mosquitoes.
   Conclusions: We recommend continued and systematic entomological monitoring in areas vulnerable to the transmission of YF in the Federal District of Brazil.

TI  - Modelling habitat suitability of the invasive tick <i>Rhipicephalus microplus</i> in West Africa
T2  - TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES
AB  - Ticks have medical and economic importance due to their ability to transmit pathogens to humans and animals. In tropical and sub-tropical countries, tick-borne diseases (TBD) are among the most important diseases affecting livestock and humans. The fast spread of ticks and TBD requires a quick development and application of efficient prevention and/or control programs. Therefore, prior investigations on TBD and related vectors epidemiology, for instance, through accurate epidemiological models, are mandatory. This study aims to develop models to forecast suitable habitat for Rhipicephalus microplus distribution in West Africa. Tick occurrences were assembled from 10 different studies carried out in six West African countries in the past decade. Six statistical models (maximum entropy in a single model and generalised linear model, generalised additive model, random forest, boosted regression tree and support vector machine model in an ensemble model) were applied and compared to predict the habitat suitability of R. microplus distribution in West Africa. Each model was evaluated with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), the true skill statistic (TSS) and the Boyce index (BI). The selected models had good performance according to their AUC (above .8), TSS (above .7) and BI (above .8). Temperature played a key role in MaxEnt model, whereas normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) was the most important variable in the ensemble model. The model predictions showed coastal countries of West Africa as more suitable for R. microplus. However, some Sahelian areas seems also favourable. We stress the importance of vector surveillance and control in countries that have not yet detected R. microplus but are in the areas predicted to host suitable habitat. Indeed, awareness-raising and training of different stakeholders must be reinforced for better prevention and control of this tick in these different countries according to their status.

TI  - PL@NTWOOD: A COMPUTER-ASSISTED IDENTIFICATION TOOL FOR 110 SPECIES OF AMAZON TREES BASED ON WOOD ANATOMICAL FEATURES
T2  - IAWA JOURNAL
AB  - Sustainable management and conservation of tropical trees and forests require accurate identification of tree species. Reliable, user-friendly identification tools based on macroscopic morphological features have already been developed for various tree floras. Wood anatomical features provide also a considerable amount of information that can be used for timber traceability, certification and trade control. Yet, this information is still poorly used, and only a handful of experts are able to use it for plant species identification. Here, we present an interactive, user-friendly tool based on vector graphics, illustrating 99 states of 27 wood characters from 110 Amazonian tree species belonging to 34 families. Pl@ntWood is a graphical identification tool based on the IDAO system, a multimedia approach to plant identification. Wood anatomical characters were selected from the IAWA list of microscopic features for hardwood identification, which will enable us to easily extend this work to a larger number of species. A stand-alone application has been developed and an on-line version will be delivered in the near future. Besides allowing non-specialists to identify plants in a user-friendly interface, this system can be used with different purposes such as teaching, conservation, management, and self-training in the wood anatomy of tropical species.

TI  - Mapping the global landscape of chikungunya rapid diagnostic tests: A scoping review
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background: Chikungunya (CHIKV) is a reemerging arboviral disease and represents a global health threat because of the unprecedented magnitude of its spread. Diagnostics strategies rely heavily on reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and antibody detection by enzyme-linked Immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are available and promise to decentralize testing and increase availability at lower healthcare system levels.
   Objectives We aim to identify the extent of research on CHIKV RDTs, map the global availability of CHIKV RDTs, and evaluate the accuracy of CHIKV RDTs for the diagnosis of CHIKV.
   Eligibility criteria
   We included studies reporting symptomatic individuals suspected of CHIKV, tested with CHIKV RDTs, against the comparator being a validated laboratory-based RT-PCR or ELISA assay. The primary outcome was the accuracy of the CHIKV RDT when compared with reference assays.
   Sources of evidence
   Medline, EMBASE, and Scopus were searched from inception to 13 October 2021. National regulatory agencies (European Medicines Agency, US Food and Drug Administration, and the Brazilian National Health Surveillance Agency) were also searched for registered CHIKV RDTs.
   Results
   Seventeen studies were included and corresponded to 3,222 samples tested with RDTs between 2005 and 2018. The most development stage of CHIKV RDTs studies was Phase I (7/17 studies) and II (7/17 studies). No studies were in Phase IV. The countries that manufacturer the most CHIKV RDTs were Brazil (n = 17), followed by the United States of America (n = 7), and India (n = 6). Neither at EMA nor FDA-registered products were found. Conversely, the ANVISA has approved 23 CHIKV RDTs. Antibody RDTs (n = 43) predominated and demonstrated sensitivity between 20% and 100%. The sensitivity of the antigen RDTs ranged from 33.3% to 100%.
   Conclusions
   The landscape of CHIKV RDTs is fragmented and needs coordinated efforts to ensure that patients in CHIKV-endemic areas have access to appropriate RDTs. Further research is crucial to determine the impact of such tests on integrated fever case management and prescription practices for acute febrile patients.

TI  - A Planetary Health Perspective on Agroforestry in Sub-Saharan Africa
T2  - ONE EARTH
AB  - Human activities change the structure and function of the environment with cascading impacts on human health, a concept known as "planetary health.'' Agroforestry-the management of trees with crops and livestock-alters microclimates, hydrology, biogeochemistry, and biodiversity. Besides the nutritional benefits of increased fruit consumption, however, the ways agroforestry affects human health are rarely articulated. This review makes that link. We analyze the pathways through which tree-based farm and landscape change affect food and nutrition security, the spread of infectious disease, the prevalence of non-communicable diseases, and human migration in Sub-Saharan Africa. The available evidence suggests that, despite some increased risks of infectious disease, agroforestry is likely to improve a diverse range of pressing health concerns. We therefore examine the factors determining agroforestry use and identify three drivers of social and environmental change that will determine the future uptake of agroforestry in the region.

TI  - Ecology of the <i>Leishmania</i> species in the Guianan ecoregion complex
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - In the Guianan ecoregion complex, at least seven Leishmania species belonging to both the L. (Leishmania) Saf' janova, 1982 and L. (Viannia) Lainson and Shaw, 1987 sub-genera are causative agents of American visceral leishmaniasis, mucocutaneous leishmaniasis, and cutaneous leishmaniases, including localized and diffuse forms. They are mostly sylvatic species subjugated to their own specific Lutzomyia sand fly vectors and to particular wild mammalian reservoir hosts of the dense rain forest. Originally implicated strictly in wild zoonoses and developing in forested ecotopes, Leishmania show a particular adaptive plasticity to face en viron mental modifications following deforestation and anthropization. This review presents the different pathogenic complexes of these parasites, emphasizes their implication in human diseases, and considers the influence of humans oil their ecology.

AB  - Sera of 807 people living in a rural forest area in southern Cameroon were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; 101 (12.5%) gave positive results and were confirmed by line immunoassay. There was a highly significant difference between subjects aged over 40 years and those under 40 years, with the former having a much higher prevalence of antibodies. There were also significant differences between antibody prevalences among subjects aged >40 years in the 3 ethnic groups studied-Baka Pygmies (6%), Fangs (30%) and Boulous (44%). Further studies are necessary to determine the reasons for these differences.

TI  - Global change, parasite transmission and disease control: lessons from ecology
T2  - PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB  - Parasitic infections are ubiquitous in wildlife, livestock and human populations, and healthy ecosystems are often parasite rich. Yet, their negative impacts can be extreme. Understanding how both anticipated and cryptic changes in a system might affect parasite transmission at an individual, local and global level is critical for sustainable control in humans and livestock. Here we highlight and synthesize evidence regarding potential effects of ` system changes' (both climatic and anthropogenic) on parasite transmission from wild host-parasite systems. Such information could inform more efficient and sustainable parasite control programmes in domestic animals or humans. Many examples from diverse terrestrial and aquatic natural systems show how abiotic and biotic factors affected by system changes can interact additively, multiplicatively or antagonistically to influence parasite transmission, including through altered habitat structure, biodiversity, host demographics and evolution. Despite this, few studies of managed systems explicitly consider these higher-order interactions, or the subsequent effects of parasite evolution, which can conceal or exaggerate measured impacts of control actions. We call for a more integrated approach to investigating transmission dynamics, which recognizes these complexities and makes use of new technologies for data capture and monitoring, and to support robust predictions of altered parasite dynamics in a rapidly changing world.
   This article is part of the themed issue 'Opening the black box: re-examining the ecology and evolution of parasite transmission'.

TI  - BIOACTIVE COMPOUNDS DURING THE MATURATION OF FOUR FRUITS NATIVE TO THE RESTINGA FOREST OF CEARA
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE FRUTICULTURA
AB  - Fruits provide not only essential nutrients for food, but also bioactive compounds that promote health benefits and help reducing the risk of developing non-communicable chronic diseases. In this sense, this work aimed at quantifying bioactive compounds during the maturation of four fruits native to the Restinga forest of Ceara. Myrtle fruits (Eugenia punicifolia (Kunth) DC.) were collected at the Botanical State Park of Ceara, Caucaia-CE, and guajiru (Chrisobalanus icaco L.), manipuca (Mouriri cearensis Huber) and murici-pitanga fruits (Byrsonima gardneriana A. Juss.) at the Botanical Garden of Sao Goncalo, Sao Goncalo do Amarante-CE. Fruits were collected at different stages (E) and transported to the Laboratory of Plant Ecophysiology, being characterized into five or six maturation stages according to the bark color, then processed and frozen for the following physicochemical and chemical evaluations: ascorbic acid, total chlorophyll, total carotenoids, total anthocyanins and yellow flavonoids. A completely randomized design was used, with five or six treatments, depending on the maturation stages of fruits and four replicates. Murici-pitanga had higher contents of ascorbic acid (ascorbic acid 646.23 mg/100 g E-5), total carotenoids (6.13 mg/100 g E-5) and total anthocyanins (7.99 mg/100 g E-2); and myrtle had higher contents of total chlorophyll (11.05 mg/100 g E-1) and yellow flavonoid (69.11 mg/100 g E-2). There are positive and significant correlations between chlorophyll and carotenoid (R= 0.99; P <0.01) for manipuca and between anthocyanin and yellow flavonoid (R= 0.97; P <0.05) for murici-pitanga fruits; however, the correlation is negative and significant between ascorbic acid and yellow flavonoids (R= -0.98; P <0.05) for myrtle fruits. It could be concluded that murici-pitanga and myrtle fruits had the highest contents of bioactive compounds with the highest levels, therefore both fruits can be recommended to be commercially exploited by the food, cosmetic and phytomedicine sectors.

TI  - What Does the Future Hold for Yellow Fever Virus? (I)
T2  - GENES
AB  - The recent resurgence of yellow fever virus (YFV) activity in the tropical regions of Africa and South America has sparked renewed interest in this infamous arboviral disease. Yellow fever virus had been a human plague for centuries prior to the identification of its urban transmission vector, the Aedes (Stegomyia) aegypti (Linnaeus) mosquito species, and the development of an efficient live-attenuated vaccine, the YF-17D strain. The combination of vector-control measures and vaccination campaigns drastically reduced YFV incidence in humans on many occasions, but the virus never ceased to circulate in the forest, through its sylvatic invertebrate vector(s) and vertebrate host(s). Outbreaks recently reported in Central Africa (2015-2016) and Brazil (since late 2016), reached considerable proportions in terms of spatial distribution and total numbers of cases, with multiple exports, including to China. In turn, questions about the likeliness of occurrence of large urban YFV outbreaks in the Americas or of a successful import of YFV to Asia are currently resurfacing. This two-part review describes the current state of knowledge and gaps regarding the molecular biology and transmission dynamics of YFV, along with an overview of the tools that can be used to manage the disease at individual, local and global levels.

TI  - Pollen Loads of Flower Visitors to Acai Palm (<i>Euterpe oleracea</i>) and Implications for Management of Pollination Services
T2  - NEOTROPICAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - Understanding the functional roles of different pollinator species is crucial to the development of sustainable farming practices in pollinator-dependent crops. However, this can be challenging for crop plants in tropical regions with hyper-diverse pollinator communities. Here, we assess pollen loads of different insect visitors to inflorescences of acai palm (Euterpe oleracea), the most important native crop in the Amazon estuary region. Flower-visiting insects were collected from pistillate (female) inflorescences at eight sites, including four managed floodplain forests and four plantations. Pollinator Importance Value Index (PIVI) and Relative Importance (RI) scores were calculated for common visitor taxa (>= 10 individuals) using sum visit frequencies and median pollen loads. Pollen load analyses revealed that over seventy insect taxa, including bees, flies, beetles, wasps and ants, were effective vectors ofE. oleraceapollen. Native bees, including both solitary and eusocial taxa, were the most efficient pollen vectors, with median pollen loads at least eight times higher than those of the next best insect group (flies). Insect pollen loads were at their highest between 0800 and 1300 hours, and four insect taxa had RI scores > 0.05, including two meliponine bees belonging to theTrigonagenus (Trigona branneriCockerell andTrigona pallensFabricius) and two halictid bee genera (AugochloropsisandDialictus). Our results suggest that native bees play an important role in acai pollination and should be the primary focus of pollinator management in acai production systems.

TI  - Habitat modification and seasonality influence avian haemosporidian parasite distributions in southeastern Brazil
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Habitat modification may change vertebrate and vector-borne disease distributions. However, natural forest regeneration through secondary succession may mitigate these effects. Here we tested the hypothesis that secondary succession influences the distribution of birds and their haemosporidian parasites (genera Plasmodium and Haemoproteus) in a seasonally dry tropical forest, a globally threatened ecosystem, in Brazil. Moreover, we assessed seasonal fluctuations in parasite prevalence and distribution. We sampled birds in four different successional stages at the peak and end of the rainy season, as well as in the middle and at the end of the dry season. A non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis revealed that bird communities in the pasture (i.e., highly modified) areas were different from those in the early, intermediate, and late successional areas (secondary forests). Among 461 individual birds, haemosporidian prevalence was higher in pasture areas than in the more advanced successional stages, but parasite communities were homogeneous across these areas. Parasite prevalence was higher in pasture-specialists birds (resilient species) than in forest-specialists species, suggesting that pasture-specialists may increase infection risk for co-occurring hosts. We found an increase in prevalence between the middle and end of the dry season, a period associated with the beginning of the breeding season (early spring) in southeastern Brazil. We also found effects of seasonality in the relative prevalence of specific parasite lineages. Our results show that natural forest recovery through secondary succession in SDTFs is associated with compositional differences in avian communities, and that advanced successional stages are associated with lower prevalence of avian haemosporidian parasites.

TI  - First report of Culex flavivirus infection from <i>Culex coronator</i> (Diptera: Culicidae), Colombia
T2  - VIROLOGY JOURNAL
AB  - BackgroundFlaviviruses are important pathogens for humans and animals (Dengue viruses, Yellow fever virus, Zika virus and West Nile virus). Culex flavivirus (CxFV) is an insect-specific virus of the genus Flavivirus, detected in a wide variety of mosquito species.ObjectiveTo detect Flavivirus in mosquitoes of a tropical region of the Colombian Caribbean.MethodsIn 2014, an entomological surveillance of arboviruses was conducted in the department of Cordoba area of the Caribbean, Colombia. A total of 8270 mosquitoes were captured as follow: Mansonia (n=3271/39.5%), Culex (n=2668/32.26%), Anopheles (n=840/10.15%), Aedeomyia (n=411/4.9%), Psorophora (n=397/4.8%), Coquilletidia (n=369/4.46%), Uranotaenia (n=261/3.15%) and Aedes (n=53/0.6%). All mosquito species were collected in dry tropical forest of the Caribbean area. Universal primers for NS5 gene (958 pb), RT-PCR for flavivirus and sequencing were used for molecular identification of viruses detected.ResultsTwo pools belonging to Culex coronator were positive for flavivirus RNA sequence by RT-PCR. The sequences of the PCR amplicons, matched that of the Culex flaviviruses, CxFv COL PM_149 (GenBank: KR014201) and CxFv COL PM_212 (GenBank: KT307717). Phylogenetic analysis of the NS5 protein sequences of the Culex flaviviruses sequences with those of reference sequences available in GenBank indicated viruses of Genotype II, closely related to the Brazilian strain, BR_SJRP_01_ (GenBank: KT726939), from Culex sp. The alignment of Culex flavivirus sequences CxFv COL_ PM 212 and CxFv COL_ PM 149 with sequences of strains detected in different geographical regions grouped the strains in a Latin American clade reported in Brazil, Argentina and Mexico.ConclusionsThe present work illustrated that CxFV was circulating among vectors of human pathogenic arboviruses in Colombia, but the impact of CxFV on other flaviviruses which are endemic in the study area still remains to be explored.

TI  - Biocontrol potential of a newly isolated <i>Streptomyces</i> sp. HSL-9B from mangrove forest on postharvest anthracnose of mango fruit caused by <i>Colletotrichum gloeosporioides</i>
T2  - FOOD CONTROL
AB  - Mango is an important tropical fruit in the world. Mango anthracnose is one of the most severe postharvest diseases caused by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides. Biocontrol by actinomycetes is considered as a promising strategy. Here, 67 actinomycetes were isolated from mangrove forest soils. A strain labelled with HSL-9B showed 63.21% of the inhibition ratio against C. gloeosporioides and broad-spectrum antifungal activities against the selected seven postharvest pathogens. The strain was assigned to Streptomyces malaysiensis based on the phenotypic, biochemical and whole-genomic profiles. Strain HSL-9B extracts significantly reduced the disease severity of mango anthracnose in vivo. 8 x EC50 of extracts completely inhibited the infection of pathogen during the entire storage process. Total soluble sugar contents on harvested mangoes were effectively kept. 4 x EC50 of extracts obviously inhibited spore germination and mycelial growth of C. gloeosporioides, resulting in mycelial rupture and cell ultrastructure destroying. The biosynthesis gene clusters (BGC) of secondary metabolites involved in antagonism were identified by compared with the whole-genome sequencing of strain HSL-9B. Fifteen compounds in strain HSL-9B extracts were obtained using the gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). 12-methyl-tridecanoic acid was one of dominant compounds identified in extracts. Hence, S. malaysiensis HSL-9B is an important bioresource for exploring novel natural products to manage postharvest disease.

TI  - Selective logging: does the imprint remain on tree structure and composition after 45 years?
T2  - CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY
AB  - Selective logging of tropical forests is increasing in extent and intensity. The duration over which impacts of selective logging persist, however, remains an unresolved question, particularly for African forests. Here, we investigate the extent to which a past selective logging event continues to leave its imprint on different components of an East African forest 45 years later. We inventoried 2358 stems >= 10 cm in diameter in 26 plots (200 m x 10 m) within a 5.2 ha area in Kibale National Park, Uganda, in logged and unlogged forest. In these surveys, we characterized the forest light environment, taxonomic composition, functional trait composition using three traits (wood density, maximum height and maximum diameter) and forest structure based on three measures (stem density, total basal area and total above-ground biomass). In comparison to unlogged forests, selectively logged forest plots in Kibale National Park on average had higher light levels, different structure characterized by lower stem density, lower total basal area and lower above-ground biomass, and a distinct taxonomic composition driven primarily by changes in the relative abundance of species. Conversely, selectively logged forest plots were like unlogged plots in functional composition, having similar community-weighted mean values for wood density, maximum height and maximum diameter. This similarity in functional composition irrespective of logging history may be due to functional recovery of logged forest or background changes in functional attributes of unlogged forest. Despite the passage of 45 years, the legacy of selective logging on the tree community in Kibale National Park is still evident, as indicated by distinct taxonomic and structural composition and reduced carbon storage in logged forest compared with unlogged forest. The effects of selective logging are exerted via influences on tree demography rather than functional trait composition.

TI  - Successional theories
T2  - BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS
AB  - Succession is a fundamental concept in ecology because it indicates how species populations, communities, and ecosystems change over time on new substrate or after a disturbance. A mechanistic understanding of succession is needed to predict how ecosystems will respond to land-use change and to design effective ecosystem restoration strategies. Yet, despite a century of conceptual advances a comprehensive successional theory is lacking. Here we provide an overview of 19 successional theories ('models') and their key points, group them based on conceptual similarity, explain conceptual development in successional ideas and provide suggestions how to move forward.Four groups of models can be recognised. The first group (patch & plants) focuses on plants at the patch level and consists of three subgroups that originated in the early 20th century. One subgroup focuses on the processes (dispersal, establishment, and performance) that operate sequentially during succession. Another subgroup emphasises individualistic species responses during succession, and how this is driven by species traits. A last subgroup focuses on how vegetation structure and underlying demographic processes change during succession. A second group of models (ecosystems) provides a more holistic view of succession by considering the ecosystem, its biota, interactions, diversity, and ecosystem structure and processes. The third group (landscape) considers a larger spatial scale and includes the effect of the surrounding landscape matrix on succession as the distance to neighbouring vegetation patches determines the potential for seed dispersal, and the quality of the neighbouring patches determines the abundance and composition of seed sources and biotic dispersal vectors. A fourth group (socio-ecological systems) includes the human component by focusing on socio-ecological systems where management practices have long-lasting legacies on successional pathways and where regrowing vegetations deliver a range of ecosystem services to local and global stakeholders.The four groups of models differ in spatial scale (patch, landscape) or organisational level (plant species, ecosystem, socio-ecological system), increase in scale and scope, and reflect the increasingly broader perspective on succession over time. They coincide approximately with four periods that reflect the prevailing view of succession of that time, although all views still coexist. The four successional views are: succession of plants (from 1910 onwards) where succession was seen through the lens of species replacement; succession of communities and ecosystems (from 1965 onwards) when there was a more holistic view of succession; succession in landscapes (from 2000 onwards) when it was realised that the structure and composition of landscapes strongly impact successional pathways, and increased remote-sensing technology allowed for a better quantification of the landscape context; and succession with people (from 2015 onwards) when it was realised that people and societal drivers have strong effects on successional pathways, that ecosystem processes and services are important for human well-being, and that restoration is most successful when it is done by and for local people.Our review suggests that the hierarchical successional framework of Pickett is the best starting point to move forward as this framework already includes several factors, and because it is flexible, enabling application to different systems.
   The framework focuses mainly on species replacement and could be improved by focusing on succession occurring at different hierarchical scales (population, community, ecosystem, socio-ecological system), and by integrating it with more recent developments and other successional models: by considering different spatial scales (landscape, region), temporal scales (ecosystem processes occurring over centuries, and evolution), and by taking the effects of the surrounding landscape (landscape integrity and composition, the disperser community) and societal factors (previous and current land-use intensity) into account. Such a new, comprehensive framework could be tested using a combination of empirical research, experiments, process-based modelling and novel tools. Applying the framework to seres across broadscale environmental and disturbance gradients allows a better insight into what successional processes matter and under what conditions.

TI  - A comparative analysis of ALOS PALSAR L-band and RADARSAT-2 C-band data for land-cover classification in a tropical moist region
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
AB  - This paper explores the use of ALOS (Advanced Land Observing Satellite) PALSARL-band (Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar) and RADARSAT-2 C-band data for land-cover classification in a tropical moist region. Transformed divergence was used to identify potential textural images which were calculated with the gray-level co-occurrence matrix method. The standard deviation of selected textural images and correlation coefficients between them were then used to determine the best combination of texture images for land-cover classification. Classification results based on different scenarios with maximum likelihood classifier were compared. Based on the identified best scenarios, different classification algorithms - maximum likelihood classifier, classification tree analysis, Fuzzy ARTMAP (a neural-network method), k-nearest neighbor, object-based classification, and support vector machine were compared for examining which algorithm was suitable for land-cover classification in the tropical moist region. This research indicates that the combination of radiometric images and their textures provided considerably better classification accuracies than individual datasets. The L-band data provided much better land-cover classification than C-band data but neither L-band nor C-band was suitable for fine land-cover classification system, no matter which classification algorithm was used. L-band data provided reasonably good classification accuracies for coarse land-cover classification system such as forest, succession, agro-pasture, water, wetland, and urban with an overall classification accuracy of 72.2%, but C-band data provided only 54.7%. Compared to the maximum likelihood classifier, both classification tree analysis and Fuzzy ARTMAP provided better performances, object-based classification and support vector machine had similar performances, and k-nearest neighbor performed poorly. More research should address the use of multitemporal radar data and the integration of radar and optical sensor data for improving land-cover classification.

TI  - Neuroprotection and enhanced neurogenesis by extract from the tropical plant <i>Knema laurina</i> after inflammatory damage in living brain tissue
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEUROIMMUNOLOGY
AB  - Inflammatory reactions in the CNS, resulting from a loss of control and involving a network of non-neuronal and neuronal cells, are major contributors to the onset and progress of several major neurodegenerative diseases. Therapeutic strategies should therefore keep or restore the well-controlled and finely-tuned balance of immune reactions, and protect neurons from inflammatory damage. In our study, we selected plants of the Malaysian rain forest by an ethnobotanic survey, and investigated them in cell-based-assay-systems and in living brain tissue cultures in order to identify anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects. We found that alcoholic extracts from the tropical plant Knema laurina (Black wild nutmeg) exhibited highly anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects in cell culture experiments, reduced NO- and IL-6-release from activated microglia cells dose-dependently, and protected living brain tissue from microglia-mediated inflammatory damage at a concentration of 30 mu g/ml. On the intracellular level, the extract inhibited ERK-1/2-phosphorylation, IkB-phosphorylation and subsequently NF-kB-translocation in microglia cells. K. laurina belongs to the family of Myristicaceae, which have been used for centuries for treatment of digestive and inflammatory diseases and is also a major food plant of the Giant Hornbill. Moreover, extract from K. laurina promotes also neurogenesis in living brain tissue after oxygen-glucose deprivation. In conclusion, extract from K. laurina not only controls and limits inflammatory reaction after primary neuronal damage, it promotes moreover neurogenesis if given hours until days after stroke-like injury.

TI  - Effects of animal pollination on pollen dispersal, selfing, and effective population size of tropical trees: A simulation study
T2  - BIOTROPICA
AB  - Animals, especially insects, are principal pollen vectors of tropical trees and have behavior patterns that affect gene dispersal. Here, we explore complex pollination systems using a new simulation model Eco-Gene and considering, among other factors, flowering synchrony. spatial distribution of trees, degree of selfing, population densities, pollinator flight distances, pollen deposition, and pollinator response to floral display size. Sensitivity analyses using two contrasting tree data sets (Jacaranda copaia and Dipteryx odorata) determined the importance of each parameter on three response variables: the proportion of seeds from self-pollination, effective population size, and pollen dispersal. Spatial considerations and attractiveness of floral displays were prominent features determining the population genetic result of pollinators, and some biological implications of the results are discussed.

TI  - Two new <i>Ceratobasidium</i> species causing white thread blight on tropical plants in Brazil
T2  - TROPICAL PLANT PATHOLOGY
AB  - White thread blight is one of the most common diseases affecting several tree species that grow in warm and humid regions. The typical symptoms of this disease include blighted leaves hanging by a white thread of fungal hyphae. Leaf samples exhibiting white thread blight symptoms were collected from neem (Azadirachta indica A. Juss) and Brazilian cherry pitanga (Eugenia uniflora L.) plants in Northeastern Brazil, and from Indian green-tea (Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze), coffee (Coffea arabica L.), and persimmon (Diospyros kaki L.) in agricultural areas neighboring the Atlantic forest in Southeastern Brazil. Fungal isolates were obtained indirectly from leaf fragments or directly by transferring mycelia and sclerotia to culture medium. Bright field and scanning electron microscopy images revealed the association of Rhizoctonia-like hyphae and basidiospores with the infected leaves. In pathogenicity tests, Rhizoctonia-like fungal isolates induced leaf necrosis on their hosts, and the pathogens were re-isolated from inoculated plants. Phylogenetic analyses based on sequences of the ITS rRNA region indicated the occurrence of Ceratobasidium lineages distinct from previously reported Ceratobasidium species. Our study leads to the description of two new species of Ceratobasidium: the fungal isolates from A. indica, C. sinensis, and E. uniflora were classified as Ceratobasidium niltonsouzanum sp. nov., and those obtained from C. arabica and D. kaki as Ceratobasidium chavesanum sp. nov.

TI  - Urological management and surgical procedures in with urogenital schistosomiasis
T2  - ACTAS UROLOGICAS ESPANOLAS
AB  - Introduction and objectives: An increasing number of urogenital schistosomiasis (UGS) is being diagnosed in Europe following the unprecedented migratory flux from Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). This phenomenon represent a challenge for urologists working in a non-endemic area. The aim of this study is to describe the urological management and the surgical procedures of patients with UGS in a tertiary referral centre.
   Patients: All subjects from SAA diagnosed with UGS from January 2011 to November 2018 were enrolled retrospectively. Detailed data of patients with UGS undergoing to urological procedures were collected and analysed.
   Results: Thirty patients were diagnosed with UGS, among them 12 (42.8%) were submitted to surgery. The most common surgical procedure was trans urethral resection of bladder (TURB) for suspected lesions persisted after praziquantel treatment performed in 7 cases (58%). Other surgical procedure were TURB and concomitant ureteroscopy with laser fragmentation for suspected bladder neoplasm with renal stone, endoscopic lithotripsy and percutaneous nephrolithotomy for bladder and renal stones, laparoscopic nephrectomy for end-stage kidney disease, placement of bilateral nephrostomy for hydroureteronephrosis, explorative testicular surgery for a suspected testicular torsion in one case each. Four patients (33%) were lost at the follow up.
   Conclusion: An increasing number of migrants from SSA diagnosed with UGS has been observed. Some patients required a surgical intervention for suspected neoplastic lesions or end-stage organ damage. It was particularly difficult to perform a regular follow-up in several patients. Further multicentric studies are needed to reach a proper standard in diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of subjects with UGS. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L.U. on behalf of AEU.

TI  - Nodular Worm Infection in Wild Chimpanzees in Western Uganda: A Risk for Human Health?
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - This study focused on Oeosophagostomum sp., and more especially on O. bifurcum, as a parasite that can be lethal to humans and is widespread among humans and monkeys in endemic regions, but has not yet been documented in apes. Its epidemiology and the role played by non-human primates in its transmission are still poorly understood. O. stephanostomum was the only species diagnosed so far in chimpanzees. Until recently, O. bifurcum was assumed to have a high zoonotic potential, but recent findings tend to demonstrate that O. bifurcum of non-human primates and humans might be genetically distinct. As the closest relative to human beings, and a species living in spatial proximity to humans in the field site studied, Pan troglodytes is thus an interesting host to investigate. Recently, a role for chimpanzees in the emergence of HIV and malaria in humans has been documented. In the framework of our long-term health monitoring of wild chimpanzees from Kibale National Park in Western Uganda, we analysed 311 samples of faeces. Coproscopy revealed that high-ranking males are more infected than other individuals. These chimpanzees are also the more frequent cropraiders. Results from PCR assays conducted on larvae and dried faeces also revealed that O. stephanostomum as well as O. bifurcum are infecting chimpanzees, both species co-existing in the same individuals. Because contacts between humans and great apes are increasing with ecotourism and forest fragmentation in areas of high population density, this paper emphasizes that the presence of potential zoonotic parasites should be viewed as a major concern for public health. Investigations of the parasite status of people living around the park or working inside as well as sympatric non-human primates should be planned, and further research might reveal this as a promising aspect of efforts to reinforce measures against crop-raiding.

TI  - Bacterial diversity in <i>Haemagogus leucocelaenus</i> (Diptera: Culicidae) from Vale do Ribeira, Sao Paulo, Brazil
T2  - BMC MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Introduction Mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) are vectors that transmit numerous pathogens to humans and other vertebrates. Haemagogus leucocelaenus is a mosquito associated with transmission of yellow fever virus. The insect gut harbors a variety of microorganisms that can live and multiply within it, thus contributing to digestion, nutrition, and development of its host. The composition of bacterial communities in mosquitoes can be influenced by both biotic and abiotic factors. The goal of this study was to investigate the bacterial diversity of Hg. leucocelaenus and verify the differences between the bacterial communities in Hg. leucocelaenus from three different locations in the Atlantic tropical rain forest and southeastern state of Sao Paulo State, Brazil. Results The phylum Proteobacteria was found in mosquitoes collected from the three selected study sites. More than 50% of the contigs belong to Wolbachia, followed by 5% Swaminathania, and 3% Acinetobacter. The genus Serratia was found in samples from two locations. Conclusions Wolbachia was reported for the first time in this species and may indicates that the vector competence of the populations of the species can vary along its geographical distribution area. The presence of Serratia might facilitate viral invasion caused by the disruption of the midgut barrier via action of the SmEnhancin protein, which digests the mucins present in the intestinal epithelium.

TI  - A Tropical Lichen, <i>Dirinaria consimilis</i> Selectively Induces Apoptosis in MCF-7 Cells through the Regulation of p53 and Caspase-Cascade Pathway
T2  - ANTI-CANCER AGENTS IN MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY
AB  - Background: Breast cancer is the most leading cause of death, with 49.9% of crude incidence rate and 12.9% of crude mortality rate. Natural resources have been extensively used throughout history for better and safer treatment against various diseases.
   Objectives: The present study was aimed to investigate the antioxidant and anticancer potential of a tropical lichen Dirinaria consimilis (DCME) and its phytochemical analysis.
   Methods: The DCME was preliminarily evaluated for ROS, and RNS scavenging potential. Furthermore, DCME was evaluated for in vitro anticancer activity through cell proliferation assay, cell cycle analysis, annexin V/PI staining, morphological analysis, and western blotting study. Finally, the HPLC and LC-MS analyses were done to identify probable bioactive compounds.
   Results: The in vitro antioxidant studies showed promising ROS, and RNS scavenging potential of DCME. Moreover, the in vitro antiproliferative study bared the cytotoxic nature of DCME towards MCF-7 (IC50 - 98.58 +/- 6.82 mu g/mL) and non-toxic towards WI-38 (IC50 - 685.85 +/- 19.51 mu g/mL). Furthermore, the flow-cytometric analysis revealed the increase in sub G(1) population as well as early apoptotic populations dose-dependently. The results from confocal microscopy showed the DNA fragmentation in MCF-7 upon DCME treatment. Finally, the western blotting study revealed the induction of tumor suppressor protein, p53, which results in increasing the Bax/Bc1-2 ratio and activation of caspase-cascade pathways.
   Conclusion: The activation of caspase-3, -8, -9 and PARP degradation led us to conclude that DCME induces apoptosis in MCF-7 through both intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms. The LC-MS analysis showed the presence of various bioactive compounds.

TI  - "There are many fevers": Communities' perception and management of Febrile illness and its relationship with human animal interactions in South-Western Uganda
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Diagnosing the causative agent of febrile illness in resource-limited countries is a challenge in part due to lack of adequate diagnostic infrastructure to confirm cause of infection. Most febrile illnesses (>60%) are non-malarial, with a significant proportion being zoonotic and likely from animal origins. To better characterize the pathways for zoonotic disease transmission and control in vulnerable communities, adequate information on the communities' experiences and lexicon describing fever, and their understanding and perceptions of risk pathways is required. We undertook an ethnographic study to understand behaviors, exposures, and attitudes toward fever at the community level. Our hope is to better elucidate areas of priority surveillance and diagnostic investment. A focused ethnography consisting of participant observation, informal conversations, 4 barazas (community meetings), and formal ethnographic interviews (13 Focus group discussions and 17 Key informant interviews) was conducted between April and November 2015 in Kasese and Hoima Districts in Uganda. Perception of illness and associated risk factors was heavily influenced by the predominant livelihood activity of the community. The term "fever" referred to multiple temperature elevating disease processes, recognized as distinct pathological occurrences. However, malaria was the illness often cited, treated, or diagnosed both at the health facilities and through self-diagnosis and treatment. As expected, fever is as an important health challenge affecting all ages. Recognition of malarial fever was consistent with a biomedical model of disease while non-malarial fevers were interpreted mainly through ethno etiological models of explanation. These models are currently being used to inform education and prevention strategies and treatment regimens toward the goal of improving patients' outcomes and confidence in the health system. Development of treatment algorithms that consider social, cultural, and economic contexts, especially where human-animal interaction is prevalent, should factor animal exposure and zoonotic illnesses as important differentials.

TI  - Ocurrence of rotavirus and picobirnavirus in wild and exotic avian from amazon forest
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Author summaryThe anthropic action in the Amazon region directly influences the relationship among pathogens, and animal hosts. This kind of action could move different species of animals from their natural habitat to urban or rural areas, which can lead to the dispersion of different etiological agents such rotavirus and picobirnavirus, showing their zoonotic potential, and increasing their genetic diversity. This study detected the circulation of rotavirus in 9/23 samples of wild, and exotic avian, and 1/23 for picobirnavirus from different cities of Para state, Brazil. We report the first occurrence of rotavirus A, D, F, G, and Genogroup I of picobirnavirus in wild, exotic birds in Brazil, and worldwide. Our data correlated the pathogens with cities, and symptoms. The data emphasize the scarce of epidemiological monitoring of these pathogens, and the importance of epidemiological studies to obtain the ecology, and evolution of rotavirus, and picobirnavirus in animals population as well as the negative impacts in animal health.
   The present study reports the occurrence of rotavirus A (RVA), rotavirus D (RVD), rotavirus F (RVF), rotavirus G (RVG), and picobirnavirus (PBV) in fecal specimens of wild (n = 22), and exotic birds (n = 1) from different cities of Para state. These animals were hospitalized at Veterinary Hospital of the Federal University of Para, Brazil, in a period from January 2018 to June 2019. The animals exhibited different clinical signs, such as diarrhea, malnutrition, dehydration, and fractures. The results showed 39.1% (9/23) of positivity for RVA by RT-qPCR. Among these, one sample (1/9) for the NSP3 gene of T2 genotype was characterized. About 88.9% (8/9) for the VP7 gene belonging to G1, G3 equine like and G6 genotypes, and 55.5% (5/9) for the VP4 gene of P[2] genotype were obtained. In the current study, approximately 4.5% of the samples (1/23) revealed coinfection for the RVA, RVD and RVF groups. Furthermore, picobirnavirus (PBV) was detected in one of the 23 samples tested, and was classified in the Genogroup I. The findings represent the first report of RVA, RVD, RVF, RVG, and PBV genotypes in wild birds in Brazil, and due to wide distribution it can implies potential impacts of RVs, and PBVs on avian health, and other animals contributing to construction of new knowledge, and care perspectives.

TI  - Landslide recognition using SVM, Random Forest, and Maximum Likelihood classifiers on high-resolution satellite images: A case study of Itaoca, southeastern Brazil
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY
AB  - Landslide identification is important for understanding their conditioning factors, and for constructing susceptibility, risk, and vulnerability maps. In remote sensing this can be accomplished manually or through classifiers. This study compares three image classifiers (Maximum Likelihood, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM)) used in identifying landslides in Itaoca (Sao Paulo, Brazil). Two datasets were used: a RapidEye-5 (5 m) image and a Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital elevation model (DEM) (12.5 m). Seven pixel-based classifications were produced, two for each classifier and a binary class that identified only landslides and non-landslides. One classification contained five spectral bands (5B), while the other contained six bands (6B) and included the slope derived from the DEM. The results were validated using Kappa index and F1 score. The SVM 6B classification achieved the best results among the validation indices used herein. It identified a landslide area of 399,325 m(2). The results contribute to landslide mapping in tropical environments using pixel-based classifiers. However, although the SVM classification was successful, only landslides with larger areas were captured by the algorithms, confirming the importance of conducting further analyses using images with finer spatial resolution.

TI  - <i>Cryptosporidium</i> animal species in Iran: a systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HEALTH
AB  - Background Cryptosporidiosis is an acute and short-term infection which can lead to severe diarrhea (intestinal cryptosporidiosis) associated with a persistent cough in the host with immune system defect. This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the prevalence of animal Cryptosporidium species and the corresponding epidemiological aspects in Iran. Methods In this study, all original research articles relating to the animal cryptosporidiosis in Iran were collected from reliable databases using keywords. A meta-analysis was conducted separately for each subgroup, and heterogeneity among the studies was performed using the Q and I-2 tests. Furthermore, it should be noticed that the significance level in the statistical analysis with the Comprehensive Meta-analysis software was considered to be less than 0.05. Finally, meta-analysis results were shown in forest plot with a 95% CI. Results In total, 4795 studies were included in the initial screening. Duplicated or non-original studies and the ones which did not meet our considered criteria were excluded from the list. Out of the 100 articles included in our first list for the meta-analysis, 40, 16, 13, 10, 9, 7, and 5 were done on cattle and calves, birds, dogs, sheep, rodents, camels, and horses, respectively. The prevalence rate of cryptosporidiosis among the birds, horses, rodents, camels, dogs, cattle, and sheep in Iran was estimated to be 7.5%, 19.5%, 20.8%, 8.4%, 4.9%, 14.4%, and 9.1%, respectively. Conclusion The different Cryptosporidium species have been found in different regions of Iran. Geographical region, climate, and domestic animals are considered as factors responsible for animal cryptosporidiosis prevalence in the area. Moreover, this parasite is zoonotic which causes disease in animals as well as humans which can result in economic loss.

TI  - Will Mayaro virus be responsible for the next outbreak of an arthropod-borne virus in Brazil?
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB  - Mayaro virus is an alphavirus from the Togaviridae family and is transmitted mainly by Hemagogus mosquitoes. This virus circulates in high-density tropical forests or rural areas of Central and South America causing a disease characterized by high-grade fever, maculopapular skin rash and marked arthralgia that, in some patients, can persist for long periods after infection and may be misinterpreted as chikungunya. Although only a few outbreaks involving this virus have been reported, in the last years the number of Mayaro virus infections has increased in the central and northern regions of Brazil. In this review, we describe the reported prevalence of this infection over the years and discuss the circumstances that can contribute to the establishment of an urban mayaro virus epidemic in Brazil and the problems encountered with the specific diagnosis, especially the antigenic cross-reactivity of this pathogen with other viruses of the same family.

TI  - Survey of <i>Plasmodium</i> in the golden-headed lion tamarin (<i>Leontopithecus chrysomelas</i>) living in urban Atlantic forest in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
AB  - Background: Communicating the presence of potential zoonotic pathogens such as Plasmodium spp. in wild animals is important for developing both animal and human health policies.
   Methods: The translocation of an exotic and invasive population of Leontopithecus chrysomelas (golden-headed lion tamarins) required the screening of these animals for specific pathogens. This studies objective was to investigate Plasmodium spp. infection in the L. chrysomelas, both to know its prevalence in these animals in the local area and to minimize the risk of pathogens being translocated to the destination site. To investigate Plasmodium spp. infection, blood samples from 268 animals were assessed for the presence of Plasmodium spp. by genus-specific PCR and stained thick and thin blood smears were examined by light microscopy. Data of human malaria infection in the studied region was also assembled from SINAN (Diseases Information System Notification-Ministry of Health of Brazil).
   Results: Results from the PCR and microscopy were all negative and suggested that no L. chrysomelas was infected with Plasmodium spp. Analysis of SINAN data showed that malaria transmission is present among the human population in the studied region.
   Conclusions: This study is the first to provide information on Plasmodium spp. infection in L. chrysomelas. Plasmodium spp. infection of this species is rare or absent though malaria parasites circulate in the region. In addition, there is minimal risk of translocating Plasmodium spp. infected animals to the destination site.

TI  - Adaptability and stability of eucalypt clones at different ages across environmental gradients in Brazil
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - The genetic gains from eucalypt breeding programs have decreased compared to previous decades while productivity reduced in recent years. This decrease is mainly attributed to climate change that, according to studies, has been limiting productivity and changing the adaptation of forest species. But other aspects can be listed, as pests and diseases and decreasing gains with the advance of breeding programs. The objective of this work is to investigate the genotype x site x age interaction in a multi-environment trial with eucalypt clones to verify the adaptability and stability of the genotypes and, finally, to identify mega-environments over time, as well as the influence of climate variables on the genotype performances. The trait diameter at breast height (DBH) of 11 Eucalyptus commercial clones at 11 sites (range from -0.84 to -24.23 latitude and from -39.60 to -52.59 longitude) and three evaluated ages (Age 1 - ranging from 13 to 17 months after planting; Age 2 - from 31 to 34 months; Age 3 - from 48 to 53 months old) was measured and analyzed by factor analytic multiplicative mixed (FAMM) model associated with the GGE biplot and multivariate regression tree using climate variables. A significant G x E interaction and genotypes with different performance across environments and ages were observed. There are clones with high adaptability to specific sites while others show good stability. The results clustered the sites into three mega-environments according to a latitude gradient, over time. The performance of Eucalyptus clones over time indicate precisely either roughly similar or extremely contrasting environments. Temperature affected the most the clustering of the studied sites followed by the latitudinal gradient, impacting productivity negatively, regardless of age. These results may help future studies on the development of selection strategies in tropical regions to address climate change and assist forest breeding programs to deal with the effect of climate change on eucalypt productivity.

TI  - The review of the Brazilian Forest Act: harmful effects on amphibian conservation
T2  - BIOTA NEOTROPICA
AB  - In the last months there is a growing discussion in Brazil about a new Brazilian Forest Act (Codigo Florestal). This new proposal, in substitution to the current Act, includes modifications which will affect negatively natural populations of amphibians. Besides the deleterious impacts upon amphibians, it will also harm the national and international human populations. Among the possible effects, in consequence of the associate amphibian population declines or complete loss, we cite the increase of agricultural production costs, loss of primary sources of compounds for the medical industry, generalized ecological disequilibrium, eutrofication of water bodies, increase in the costs of water (for humans) treatment, increase of agricultural plagues, and increase of insect borne diseases. All these effects are of high relevance, even more if we consider the population declines of amphibians, the most threatened terrestrial vertebrate group in the world. Therefore, we propose that if a new Forest Act must be prepared, that it should be based, besides in unlikely immediate economical benefits to farm owners, in scientific knowledge which benefits nature conservancy, economy, health, and human welfare.

TI  - The role of harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) products to reveal multiple trajectories and determinants of cropland abandonment in subtropical mountainous areas
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - Cropland abandonment is a widespread land-change process globally, which can stem from the accelerated outmigration of the population from rural to urban areas, socio-economic and political changes, catastrophes, and other trigger events. Clouds limit the utility of optical satellite data to monitor cropland abandonment in highly fragmented mountain agricultural landscapes of tropical and subtropical regions, including the south of China. Taking Nanjing County of China as an example, we developed a novel approach by utilizing multisource satellite (Landsat and Sentinel-2) imagery to map multiple trajectories of cropland abandonment (transitioning from cropland to grassland, shrubs and forest) in subtropical mountainous landscapes. Then, we employed a redundancy analysis (RDA) to identify the spatial association of cropland abandonment considering agricultural productivity, physiography, locational characteristics and economic factors. Results indicate the great suitability of harmonized Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 images to distinguish multiple trajectories of cropland abandonment in subtropical mountainous areas. Our framework of mapping cropland abandonment resulted in good producer's (78.2%) and user's (81.3%) accuracies. The statistical analysis showed 31.85% of croplands cultivated in 2000 were abandoned by 2018, and more than a quarter of townships experienced cropland abandonment with high abandoned rates (>38%). Cropland abandonment mainly occurred in relatively unfavorable areas for agricul-tural production, for instance with a slope above 6 degrees. Slope and the proximity to the nearest settlement explained 65.4% and 8.1% of the variation of cropland abandonment at the township level, respectively. The developed approaches on both mapping cropland abandonment and modeling determinants can be highly relevant to monitor multiple trajectories of cropland abandonment and ascribe their determinants not only in mountainous China but also elsewhere and thus promote the formulation of land-use policies that aim to steer cropland abandonment.

TI  - The current drug discovery landscape for trypanosomiasis and leishmaniasis: Challenges and strategies to identify drug targets
T2  - DRUG DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH
AB  - Human trypanosomiasis and leishmaniasis are vector-borne neglected tropical diseases caused by infection with the protozoan parasitesTrypanosomaspp. andLeishmaniaspp., respectively. Once restricted to endemic areas, these diseases are now distributed worldwide due to human migration, climate change, and anthropogenic disturbance, causing significant health and economic burden globally. The current chemotherapy used to treat these diseases has limited efficacy, and drug resistance is spreading. Hence, new drugs are urgently needed. Phenotypic compound screenings have prevailed as the leading method to discover new drug candidates against these diseases. However, the publication of the complete genome sequences of multiple strains, advances in the application of CRISPR/Cas9 technology, and in vivo bioluminescence-based imaging have set the stage for advancing target-based drug discovery. This review analyses the limitations of the narrow pool of available drugs presently used for treating these diseases. It describes the current drug-based clinical trials highlighting the most promising leads. Furthermore, the review presents a focused discussion on the most important biological and pharmacological challenges that target-based drug discovery programs must overcome to advance drug candidates. Finally, it examines the advantages and limitations of modern research tools designed to identify and validate essential genes as drug targets, including genomic editing applications and in vivo imaging.

TI  - Urban climate versus global climate change-what makes the difference for dengue?
T2  - HUMAN HEALTH IN THE FACE OF CLIMATE CHANGE
CP  - Conference on Human Health in the Face of Climate Change
AB  - The expansion in the geographical distribution of vector-borne diseases is a much emphasized consequence of climate change, as are the consequences of urbanization for diseases that are already endemic, which may be even more important for public health. In this paper, we focus on dengue, the most widespread urban vector-borne disease. Largely urban with a tropical/subtropical distribution and vectored by a domesticated mosquito, Aedes aegypti, dengue poses a serious public health threat. Temperature plays a determinant role in dengue epidemic potential, affecting crucial parts of the mosquito and viral life cycles. The urban predilection of the mosquito species will further exacerbate the impact of global temperature change because of the urban heat island effect. Even within a city, temperatures can vary by 10 degrees C according to urban land use, and diurnal temperature range (DTR) can be even greater. DTR has been shown to contribute significantly to dengue epidemic potential. Unraveling the importance of within-city temperature is as important for dengue as for the negative health consequences of high temperatures that have thus far been emphasized, for example, pollution and heat stroke. Urban and landscape planning designed to mitigate the non-infectious negative effects of temperature should additionally focus on dengue, which is currently spreading worldwide with no signs of respite.

TI  - Characterization and selection of Brazilian native grasses for use as turfgrass
T2  - INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON GREENER CITIES FOR MORE EFFICIENT ECOSYSTEM SERVICES IN A CLIMATE CHANGING WORLD
CP  - International Symposium on Greener Cities for More Efficient Ecosystem Services in a Climate Changing World
AB  - The objective of this study was to characterize eight accessions of Brazilian native turfgrasses, namely Axonopus parodii (AP 01), Paspalum lepton (PL 01) and P. notatum (PN 01, 02, 03, 04, 05 and PN 06) and select accessions for use as permanent ground coverage in tropical conditions. The experiment was conducted in a randomized block design, with four repetitions, in the Rain Forest Zone of the State of Pernambuco, Brazil, from October, 2013 to April, 2014. The accessions were evaluated 79 to 189 days after planting in terms of mowing frequency, turfgrass residue exported from the mowing dry biomass (g m(-2)) and weeds dry biomass (g m(-2)). At the end of the experiment the turfgrass ornamental appearance was evaluated by scales of notes as: excellent (uniform green color, soil coverage higher than 90%, absence of dry leaves and weeds); pleasant (uniform green color, soil coverage between 75 and 90%, low quantity of dry leaves and weeds); not very pleasant (green color moderate uniform, soil coverage between 60 and 75%, moderate quantity of dry leaves and weeds); unpleasant (green color ununiform, soil coverage below 60%, high quantity of dry leaves and weeds). All accessions reached the cutting heights of 7.5 cm, requiring mowing 10 (PN 01) to 14 (PN 02, 03, 04 and PN 05) times during the period of 110 days of cultivation. PN 01, 02, 03 and PN 05 accumulated largest mowing dry biomass, nevertheless reduced the weeds development, demonstrated by lowest dry biomass observed. The accession AP 01 accumulated the lowest mowing dry biomass, allowing greatest development of weeds in their plot of turfgrass. Based on the excellent appearance demonstrated by the uniform green color, high soil coverage and low quantity of dry leaves and weeds, the accessions PN 01, 03 and PN 05 are suitable to use as intensively managed turfgrass (with mowing and fertilization when necessary, frequent irrigation, control of pest, diseases and weeds), which are used for recreational and ornamental lawns in tropical conditions.

TI  - Landscape and Residential Variables Associated with Plague-Endemic Villages in the West Nile Region of Uganda
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Plague, caused by the bacteria Yersinia pestis, is a severe, often fatal disease. This study focuses on the plague-endemic West Nile region of Uganda, where limited information is available regarding environmental and behavioral risk factors associated with plague infection. We conducted observational surveys of 10 randomly selected huts within historically classified case and control villages (four each) two times during the dry season of 2006 (N = 78 case huts and N = 80 control huts), which immediately preceded a large plague outbreak. By coupling a previously published landscape-level statistical model of plague risk with this observational survey, we were able to identify potential residence-based risk factors for plague associated with huts within historic case or control villages (e.g., distance to neighboring homestead and presence of pigs near the home) and huts within areas previously predicted as elevated risk or low risk (e.g., corn and other annual crops grown near the home, water storage in the home, and processed commercial foods stored in the home). The identified variables are consistent with current ecologic theories on plague transmission dynamics. This preliminary study serves as a foundation for future case control studies in the area.

TI  - Serological evidence of high <i>Leptospira</i> exposure among indigenous people (Orang Asli) in Peninsular Malaysia using a recombinant antigen-based ELISA
T2  - TROPICAL BIOMEDICINE
AB  - The lifestyles of the indigenous people (Orang Asli) of Peninsular Malaysia who traditionally live close to the forest, put them at higher risk of exposure to zoonotic diseases. Leptospirosis has recently emerged as one of the most important diseases of public health concern. Here, we aimed to obtain a baseline data on the level of Leptospira exposure among the 107 Orang Asli volunteers using a recombinant antigen-based ELISA, previously shown to have sensitivity of similar to 90.0% in comparison to the microscopic agglutination test (MAT). Among the Orang Asli volunteers in this study, 60.7% had IgM against Leptospira and 57.9% were anti-Leptospira IgG positive. Of these seropositive individuals, 29.9% had both anti-Leptospira IgM and IgG antibodies. Age was found to be a significant predictor for exposure to Leptospira (P < 0.05) with the younger Orang Asli population more likely to be tested positive for anti-Leptospira IgM. The finding of high Leptospira exposure among the Orang Asli volunteers could be due to their socio-economic practices and dependency on the forest for their livelihood. The rapid and sensitive recombinant antigen-based ELISA used in the study, could possibly complement MAT for the epidemiological surveillance of leptospirosis, especially among the underserved populations.

Soil bacteria with a higher alpha diversity were present in low stand density. Absract Different land-use patterns and silvicultural practices contribute to the shifting composition and assemblage of soil bacterial communities. Positive plant and soil responses to nutrient acquisition, promotion of sustainable growth, resistance to biotic and abiotic stress, and disease suppression depend on favorable interactions between plant roots and microbes. This study investigated the community assemblage of soil bacteria and its interaction with soil quality indicators and canopy growth parameters (e.g., mean tilt angle of the leaf (MTA), leaf area index (LAI), and canopy openness index (DIFN)) in low, intermediate and high density stands of Chinese fir plantation at two soil depths (0-20 and 20-40 cm). The results showed that the soils of the low-density stand had higher alpha-bacterial diversity than the soils of medium and high-density forests. Among all variables, Acidobacteria was the most dominant phylum with 24.72%, followed by Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria and Chloroflexi with 20.41%, 15.89%, 11.67%, respectively. Among different canopy parameters, low-density associated bacterial diversity was positively correlated with the canopy openness index. Among soil properties, potassium, nitrogen, and phosphorus were considerably influential factors to bacterial communities. Redundancy analysis (RDA) results showed that soil physiochemical properties accounted for 31.86% of the total migration of the soil bacterial communities. Although soil attributes were the significant contributing factors affecting bacterial communities, varying stand density was the main factor altering bacterial diversity. By revealing changes in soil bacterial relative abundance and richness patterns at different levels of stand density, this study would provide comprehensive proof of the complexity of belowground ecology. It will also serve as a foundation for developing sustainable management strategies in silty oxisol soil types and plantation crops.

TI  - Alphavirus protease inhibitors from natural sources: A homology modeling and molecular docking investigation
T2  - COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY
AB  - Alphaviruses such as Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), O'Nyong-Nyong virus (ONNV), Ross River virus (RRV), Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV), Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV), and Western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV), are mosquito-transmitted viruses that can cause fevers, rash, and rheumatic diseases (CHIKV, ONNV, RRV) or potentially fatal encephalitis (EEEV, VEEV, WEEV) in humans. These diseases are considered neglected tropical diseases for which there are no current antiviral therapies or vaccines available. The alphavirus non-structural protein 2 (nsP2) contains a papain-like protease, which is considered to be a promising target for antiviral drug discovery. In this work, molecular docking analyses have been carried out on a library of 2174 plant-derived natural products (290 alkaloids, 664 terpenoids, 1060 polyphenolics, and 160 miscellaneous phytochemicals) with the nsP2 proteases of CHIKV, ONNV, RRV, EEEV, VEEV, WEEV, as well as Aura virus (AURV), Barmah Forest Virus (BFV), Semliki Forest virus (SFV), and Sindbis virus (SINV) in order to identity structural scaffolds for inhibitor design or discovery. Of the 2174 phytochemicals examined, a total of 127 showed promising docking affinities and poses to one or more of the nsP2 proteases, and this knowledge can be used to guide experimental investigation of potential inhibitors.

T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
CP  - VII International Meeting on Human Retrovirology - HTLV-I
AB  - Using stringent Western blot (WB) criteria, human T cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV) type I seroprevalence among 3783 persons from representative rural populations of Cameroon averaged 1.1% and was higher in females (1.5%) and in Pygmies (2.0%), increasing with age, Furthermore, an HTLV-I Gag-indeterminate WE profile (HGIP), exhibiting strong reactivities to p19, p26, p28, p32, p36, and pr 53 but lacking both p24 and env reactivity, was observed in 1.6% of the same populations, The prevalence of the HGIP was similar between males and females, did not increase with age, and appeared to cluster in tropical forests of southern Cameroon, especially among Pygmies (reaching 4%). These contrasting epidemiologic features, together with the lack of detection by polymerase chain reaction of HTLV-I sequences in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of the persons with HGIP, strongly suggest that such a WE profile does not appear to reflect an HTLV-I-related viral infection but possibly an environmental (viral or parasitic) factor endemic in tropical rain forest areas.

TI  - Plague in Zimbabwe from 1974 to 2018: A review article
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Plague is a zoonotic disease caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis and is transmitted through the bites of infected rodent fleas. Plague is well known for causing 3 major human pandemics that have killed millions of people since 541 A.D. The aim of this Review is to provide an overview of the epidemiology and ecology of plague in Zimbabwe with special emphasis on its introduction, its potential reservoirs and vectors, and possible causes of its persistence and cyclic outbreaks. To achieve this, we carried out a search and document reported plague outbreaks in Zimbabwe. In the country, human plague cases have been reported in Hwange, Nkayi, and Lupane since 1974. The highest number of cases occurred in 1994 in the Nkayi district of Matabeleland North Province with a total of 329 confirmed human cases and 28 deaths. Plague is encountered in 2 different foci in the country, sylvatic and rural. Risk factors for contracting plague in the country include man-to-rodent contact, cultivation, hunting, cattle herding, handling of infected materials, camping in forests, and anthropic invasion of new areas. Plague is now enzootic in Zimbabwe, and the most recent case was reported in 2012, hence its effective control requires up-to-date information on the epidemiology and ecology of the disease. This can be achieved through continuous monitoring and awareness programs in plague-prone areas.

TI  - Two <i>Triatoma dimidiata</i> clades (Chagas disease vector) associated with different habitats in southern Mexico and Central America
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Triatoma dimidiata is the only reported Chagas disease vector in Campeche, Mexico. The purpose of this study was to determine the genetic variability of vectors from Campeche coastal and rain forest areas and establish a phylogenetic relationship with other T dimidiata populations by analyzing the internal transcribed spacer-2 (ITS-2) region. The sequence length of samples from Campeche ranged from 469 to 478 basepairs. The ITS-2 variability among the populations enabled us to classify them into two clades with an 18-22 nucleotide difference. The genetic distance (0.042) between them confirms this divergence. Phylogenetic analysis of gene genealogies confirmed these two clades. Furthermore, the population genetic analyses showed two groups with little genetic similarity or migration between them. One group was associated with the tropical forest area and the other group was associated with a mainly coastal distribution. This correlation was also observed when T dimidiata from other regions of Mexico and Central America were analyzed.

TI  - Xenosurveillance reflects traditional sampling techniques for the identification of human pathogens: A comparative study in West Africa
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   Novel surveillance strategies are needed to detect the rapid and continuous emergence of infectious disease agents. Ideally, new sampling strategies should be simple to implement, technologically uncomplicated, and applicable to areas where emergence events are known to occur. To this end, xenosurveillance is a technique that makes use of blood collected by hematophagous arthropods to monitor and identify vertebrate pathogens. Mosquitoes are largely ubiquitous animals that often exist in sizable populations. As well, many domestic or peridomestic species of mosquitoes will preferentially take blood-meals from humans, making them a unique and largely untapped reservoir to collect human blood.
   Methodology/Principal findings
   We sought to take advantage of this phenomenon by systematically collecting blood-fed mosquitoes during a field trail in Northern Liberia to determine whether pathogen sequences from blood engorged mosquitoes accurately mirror those obtained directly from humans. Specifically, blood was collected from humans via finger-stick and by aspirating bloodfed mosquitoes from the inside of houses. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing of RNA and DNA derived from these specimens was performed to detect pathogen sequences. Samples obtained from xenosurveillance and from finger-stick blood collection produced a similar number and quality of reads aligning to two human viruses, GB virus C and hepatitis B virus.
   Conclusions/Significance
   This study represents the first systematic comparison between xenosurveillance and more traditional sampling methodologies, while also demonstrating the viability of xenosurveillance as a tool to sample human blood for circulating pathogens.

TI  - Upland rice varieties for smallholder farming in the cold conditions in Madagascar's tropical highlands
T2  - FIELD CROPS RESEARCH
AB  - Upland rice cropping has become a familiar part of the landscape in Madagascar's central highlands, a densely populated region mainly characterized by resource poor family farmers and cold climatic conditions. A survey of 485 farmers conducted in 2011-2012 revealed that 71% of them cultivated upland rice although the crop was absent in this region before the first cold tolerant varieties were released in 1995. It also revealed that a single variety, Chhomrong Dhan (CD) originating from Nepal and released in 2006 was by far the most widely cultivated variety and accounted for 82.5% of the total acreage of upland rice. Farmers appreciate CD for its relatively high yield under low input conditions. However, this dominance raises concerns about the resilience of upland rice agro-systems in the face of changes in climatic conditions or in pathogen populations. To identify key varietal adaptive traits that should be taken into account in the breeding of new upland rice varieties in this context, we compared a panel of improved varieties including CD under low input management over two cropping seasons. A strong positive correlation between leaf area index (LAI) before harvest and yield was observed. Varieties with the highest yield, including CD, are of long duration, produce high biomass yields, have a high LAI and the highest harvest index. A significant negative correlation was observed between the LAI of rice varieties and that of weeds, showing that a high LAI also helps limit competition for resources by weeds. In the context of subsistence family farming and in the cold conditions of Madagascar's tropical highlands, new improved varieties should combine high LAI, high harvest index and long duration, as these traits help compete with weeds and contribute to high yield potential under low input management, on the one hand, and resistance to blast, cold tolerance and reduced crop duration, traits that prevent yield losses, on the other hand. The trade-off between crop duration and the risk of cold-induced sterility specific to the cold conditions of Madagascar highlands has to be taken into account. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - The importance of different forms of prevention in travel medicine
T2  - ASIAN PACIFIC JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE
AB  - The Asia-Pacific region is becoming an increasingly popular destination for holidaymakers and business travelers. Despite the seductive tourist attractions and the growing financial importance of the region, infectious diseases have unfortunately repeatedly caused major epidemics in the region. The area includes various geographical situations from high mountains to the subtropical and monsoon forests, dry deserts and seashore. The travel medicine specialist's task is to decrease the various risk of travel to the region. Infectious diseases, extreme temperatures and marine hazards could be almost entirely prevented by primary prevention forms of travel medicine such as vaccination, chemoprophylaxis and pretravel advice. There are some high-risk groups (e.g., elderly people, backpackers, families with children, adventure travelers) among the growing number of tourists. Obviously, the increased numbers of such travelers result in a rising incidence of travel- related illnesses and accidents. For those groups, primary prevention sometimes is not enough. The pretravel medical check up, specialists' consultations and treatment, as forms of secondary prevention, are also essential in travel medicine. Patients who suffer from serious illnesses or who have accidents must often be repatriated. "State-of-the-art repatriation", as a special form of tertiary prevention of travel medicine will play an important role in the future and is directly related to effective travel insurance, which could help in providing good medical care to the patients even far from their home. The levels, methods and importance of prevention in travel medicine are discussed in this article.

TI  - Fruit dispersal syndromes in animal disseminated plants at Tinigua National Park, Colombia
T2  - REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL
AB  - Fruit dispersal syndromes (groups of plants with similar fruit morphology, presumably adapted to dispersal by a particular set of vectors) have been described in a variety of tropical localities. In some cases the presence of different syndromes in each locality suggests independent evolution of fruit traits in response to selective pressures imposed by the particular animal community in each place. However, it is still unclear how general are fruit syndromes, and this is important to understand the evolution of mutualistic relationships. We compiled morphological information from about 500 fleshy fruited species at a lowland Neotropical forest in Tinigua National Park, Colombia, in an effort to test for the existence of fruit dispersal syndromes. We found that about two thirds of the plant genera analyzed could be classified in two different fruit types (large, protected, dull colored fruits, versus small, unprotected, bright colored fruits). These two syndromes correspond to the mammal and bird dispersal syndromes originally described at Cocha Cashu Biological Station, Peru. Two years of field observations on several fruiting plants revealed close associations between these fruit syndromes and the presumed animal dispersal vector. Our results support the idea that fruit dispersal syndromes are more general in Neotropical forests than previously inferred. However, we caution that similar syndromes found at Cocha Cashu and Tinigua may be a consequence of the floristic resemblance of both regions, and may not necessarily imply an independent case for the evolution of mammal and bird dispersal syndromes. Therefore, additional studies of fruit syndromes and biogeographical analyses would be necessary to assess how general are dispersal syndromes in the Neotropics.

TI  - Geographic patterns of tree dispersal modes in Amazonia and their ecological correlates
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY
AB  - Aim To investigate the geographic patterns and ecological correlates in the geographic distribution of the most common tree dispersal modes in Amazonia (endozoochory, synzoochory, anemochory and hydrochory). We examined if the proportional abundance of these dispersal modes could be explained by the availability of dispersal agents (disperser-availability hypothesis) and/or the availability of resources for constructing zoochorous fruits (resource-availability hypothesis). Time period Tree-inventory plots established between 1934 and 2019. Major taxa studied Trees with a diameter at breast height (DBH) >= 9.55 cm. Location Amazonia, here defined as the lowland rain forests of the Amazon River basin and the Guiana Shield. Methods We assigned dispersal modes to a total of 5433 species and morphospecies within 1877 tree-inventory plots across terra-firme, seasonally flooded, and permanently flooded forests. We investigated geographic patterns in the proportional abundance of dispersal modes. We performed an abundance-weighted mean pairwise distance (MPD) test and fit generalized linear models (GLMs) to explain the geographic distribution of dispersal modes. Results Anemochory was significantly, positively associated with mean annual wind speed, and hydrochory was significantly higher in flooded forests. Dispersal modes did not consistently show significant associations with the availability of resources for constructing zoochorous fruits. A lower dissimilarity in dispersal modes, resulting from a higher dominance of endozoochory, occurred in terra-firme forests (excluding podzols) compared to flooded forests. Main conclusions The disperser-availability hypothesis was well supported for abiotic dispersal modes (anemochory and hydrochory). The availability of resources for constructing zoochorous fruits seems an unlikely explanation for the distribution of dispersal modes in Amazonia. The association between frugivores and the proportional abundance of zoochory requires further research, as tree recruitment not only depends on dispersal vectors but also on conditions that favour or limit seedling recruitment across forest types.

TI  - Soil selenium in a forested seabird colony: distribution, sources, uptake by plants, and comparison with non-seabird sites
T2  - SOIL RESEARCH
AB  - Seabirds vector selenium (Se) into terrestrial ecosystems in Antarctica and on tropical coral islands, but factors controlling distribution within affected soils are unknown, especially in temperate regions. At a Westland petrel (Procellaria westlandica) breeding colony on mainland New Zealand, the concentration of Se in petrel guano (3.6 mg kg(-1)) exceeded soil parent material (0.8 mg kg(-1)) and in all but two soil samples (range 1.2-4.2 mg kg(-1); n = 52). External Se (Se not derived from parent material) accounted for 64 +/- 9% (mean +/- s.d.) of soil Se. Measurements were also made at a former seabird breeding site, and at a site with no Holocene seabird breeding. Median surface-soil Se concentrations (mg kg(-1)) were in the order burrow soil (2.6) > adjacent forest floor (2.2) > former breeding site (1.0) > control site (0.2), with significant differences between burrow soil and (1) the former breeding site and (2) the control site. In a linear regression model, soil pH, and delta N-15 were the only significant predictors of external Se in colony soil. The correlations are consistent with seabird input driving both the Se supply and increased sorptive uptake in an environment acidified by seabird guano. Despite the enhanced Se in colony soil, median foliage concentrations (tree fern 0.05 mg kg(-1), nikau 0.08 mg kg(-1)) were close to the accepted minimum for herbivore nutrition. Seabirds therefore contribute significant Se to breeding colony soils in temperate areas, but this is not necessarily transferred to plant foliage.

TI  - Characterization of an extracellular endopolygalacturonase from the saprobe <i>Mucor ramosissimus</i> Samutsevitsch and its action as trigger of defensive response in tropical plants
T2  - MYCOPATHOLOGIA
AB  - In recent years, interest in the ability of non-pathogenic microorganisms to induce resistance in plants has grown, particularly with respect to their use as environmentally safe controllers of plant disease. In this study, we investigated the capacity of Mucor ramosissimus Samutsevitsch to release pectinases able to degrade cell walls of Palicourea marcgravii St. Hil., a tropical forest native Rubiaceae on which the spores of this saprobic fungus have been found. The fungus was grown in liquid culture medium containing pectin as the sole carbon source and filtrates were analyzed for pectinase activity. An endopolygalacturonase was partially purified by ion exchange chromatography, gel filtration, and preparative isoelectrofocusing, and characterized. This enzyme was more active upon pectic substrates with a low degree of methyl esterification. The products of hydrolysis of different pectic substrates (including pectin from P. marcgravii) by the action of this endopolygalacturonase elicited to different extents the phytoalexin production in soybean cotyledons. Also, the enzyme itself and the products of its action on the pectic fraction of P. marcgravii elicited the production of defensive compounds in the leaves of the plant. These results suggest that, besides the role in recycling organic matter, saprobes may also play an important role in the induction of defensive mechanisms in wild plants by enhancing their non-specific resistance against pathogens. Furthermore, they set the stage for future studies on the role of saprobic fungi in inducing resistance of host plants to pathogens.

TI  - Experimental Transmission of Karshi (Mammalian Tick-Borne Flavivirus Group) Virus by <i>Ornithodoros</i> Ticks > 2,900 Days after Initial Virus Exposure Supports the Role of Soft Ticks as a Long-Term Maintenance Mechanism for Certain Flaviviruses
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   Members of the mammalian tick-borne flavivirus group, including tick-borne encephalitis virus, are responsible for at least 10,000 clinical cases of tick-borne encephalitis each year. To attempt to explain the long-term maintenance of members of this group, we followed Ornithodoros parkeri, O. sonrai, and O. tartakovskyi for > 2,900 days after they had been exposed to Karshi virus, a member of the mammalian tick-borne flavivirus group.
   Methodology/Principal Findings
   Ticks were exposed to Karshi virus either by allowing them to feed on viremic suckling mice or by intracoelomic inoculation. The ticks were then allowed to feed individually on suckling mice after various periods of extrinsic incubation to determine their ability to transmit virus by bite and to determine how long the ticks would remain infectious. The ticks remained efficient vectors of Karshi virus, even when tested > 2,900 d after their initial exposure to virus, including those ticks exposed to Karshi virus either orally or by inoculation.
   Conclusions/Significance
   Ornithodoros spp. ticks were able to transmit Karshi virus for > 2,900 days (nearly 8 years) after a single exposure to a viremic mouse. Therefore, these ticks may serve as a long-term maintenance mechanism for Karshi virus and potentially other members of the mammalian tick-borne flavivirus group.

TI  - Ability of machine learning models to identify preferred habitat traits of a small indigenous fish (<i>Chanda nama</i>) in a large river of peninsular India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB  - Physical and chemical parameters of river influence the habitat of fish species in aquatic ecosystems. Fish showed a complex relationship with different aquatic factors in river. Machine learning modeling is a useful tool to identify relationships between components of a complex environmental system. We identified the preferred habitat indicators of Chanda nama (a small indigenous fish), in the Krishna River located in peninsular India, using machine learning modeling. Using data on Chanda nama fish distribution (presence/absence) and associated ten physical and chemical parameters of water at 22 sampling sites of the river collected during the year 2001-2002, machine learning models such as random forest, artificial neural network, support vector machine, and k-nearest neighbors were used for classification of Chanda nama distribution in the river. The machine learning model efficiency was evaluated using classification accuracy, Cohen's kappa coefficient, sensitivity, specificity, and receiver-operating-characteristics. Results showed that random forest is the best model with higher classification accuracy (82%), Cohen's kappa coefficient (0.55), sensitivity (0.57), specificity (0.76), and receiver-operating-characteristics (0.72) for prediction of the occurrence of Chanda nama in the Krishna River. Random forest model identified three preferred physicochemical habitat traits such as altitude, temperature, and depth for Chanda nama distribution in Krishna River. Our results will be helpful for researcher and policy maker to understand important physical and chemical variables for sustainable management of a small indigenous fish (Chanda nama) in a large tropical river.

TI  - Saving Almaciga (<i>Agathis philippinensis</i>): means of cultural preservation and species rehabilitation in Palawan, Philippines
T2  - PALAWAN SCIENTIST
AB  - Agathis philippinensis Warb. (Almaciga) is a coniferous tree that forms a dominant component of upland primary forest in Palawan, Philippines. Almagica is valued for its high-quality timber and for its resin, which is used in the manufacture of varnish and linoleum. The species is categorized as "vulnerable" by the IUCN due to illegal logging, destructive methods of resin tapping, and land-use change. In Palawan, collection of Almagica resin provides up to 80% of income for indigenous communities and other inhabitants living in close proximity to the forests. A recent study into the effect of resin harvesting suggested that the resource is being collected unsustainably, leaving trees highly susceptible to outbreaks of pests and diseases, reproductive failure and death of trees, increasing the risk of local extinctions. Thus, the economic livelihood and future of indigenous peoples who depend on Almaciga resin is uncertain. This study aimed to provide protocols on propagation, reforestation, and sustainable management of A. philippinensis. This knowledge can be used to rehabilitate depleted populations of Almaciga. Between July and December 2016, three nurseries were established across two indigenous communities in the Cleopatra's Needle Mountain range, Palawan, where more than 10,000 seeds were collected and sown in seedbeds. These seeds generated more than 6,000 seedlings that were propagated, nursed and monitored throughout the study. Information on the collection of cones, seeds and seedlings, propagation and nursery management, identification and mitigation of pests and diseases, and environmental requirements for growth and survival were documented. The propagated seedlings were used to reforest declining populations of this species, thereby ensuring the future livelihood of the indigenous communities is preserved through conservation of Almagica populations.

TI  - Global Environmental Change and Noncommunicable Disease Risks
T2  - ANNUAL REVIEW OF PUBLIC HEALTH, VOL 40
AB  - Multiple global environmental changes (GECs) now under way, including climate change, biodiversity loss, freshwater depletion, tropical deforestation, overexploitation of fisheries, ocean acidification, and soil degradation, have substantial, but still imperfectly understood, implications for human health. Noncommunicable diseases (NICDs) make a major contribution to the global burden of disease. Many of the driving forces responsible for GEC also influence NCD risk through a range of mechanisms. This article provides an overview of pathways linking GEC and NICDs, focusing on five pathways: (a) energy, air pollution, and climate change; (b) urbanization; (c) food, nutrition, and agriculture; (d) the deposition of persistent chemicals in the environment; and (c) biodiversity loss.

TI  - Baby pangolins on my plate: possible lessons to learn from the COVID-19 pandemic
T2  - JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY AND ETHNOMEDICINE
AB  - The Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine (JEET), throughout its 15 years of existence, has tried to provide a respected outlet for scientific knowledge concerning the inextricable links between human societies and nature, food, and health. Ethnobiology and ethnomedicine-centred research has moved at the (partially artificial and fictitious) interface between nature and culture and has investigated human consumption of wild foods and wild animals, as well as the use of wild animals or their parts for medicinal and other purposes, along with the associated knowledge, skills, practices, and beliefs. Little attention has been paid, however, to the complex interplay of social and cultural reasons behind the increasing pressure on wildlife. The available literature suggest that there are two main drivers that enhance the necessary conditions for infectious diseases to cross the species barrier from wild animals to humans: (1) the encroachment of human activities (e.g., logging, mining, agricultural expansion) into wild areas and forests and consequent ecological disruptions; and, connected to the former, (2) the commodification of wild animals (and natural resources in general) and an expanding demand and market for wild meat and live wild animals, particularly in tropical and sub-tropical areas. In particular, a crucial role may have been played by the bushmeat-euphoria and attached elitist gastronomies and conspicuous consumption phenomena. The COVID-19 pandemic will likely require ethnobiologists to reschedule research agendas and to envision new epistemological trajectories aimed at more effectively mitigating the mismanagement of natural resources that ultimately threats our and other beings' existence.

TI  - Landcover classification using ERS SAR/InSAR data on coastal region of central Sumatra
T2  - THIRD ERS SYMPOSIUM ON SPACE AT THE SERVICE OF OUR ENVIRONMENT, VOL 1
CP  - 3rd ERS Symposium on Space at the Service of Our Environment
AB  - In this study, we present a classification method using both optical and SAR data in order to perform landcover classification. We investigate the use of a vector of information, composed of a serie of signatures derived from both SAR and INSAR data. First, different relevant parameters are derived from ERS-SAR data using multitemporal and interferometric analysis. Optical data is then used to define a training set in to order to perform a supervised classification. Our test site is located in a tropical area, in the coastal region of Central Sumatra, Indonesia. This site has a wide variety of landcover types. The region has been undergoing rapid deforestation with the logging of commercially exploitable timber and the conversion of forest to agricultural land. Our results demonstrate that ERS-1/2 tandem data is more suitable than the 35 days repeat pass in discriminating various landcover types. The results of classification using these techniques are compared with existing landuse maps and information derived from SPOT and LANDSAT data.

TI  - Mosquitocidal activity of a native <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i> isolate Bt ReX02 from Gunung Jerai Forest, Malaysia against <i>Culex quinquefasciatus</i> and <i>Aedes albopictus</i>
T2  - EUROPEAN REVIEW FOR MEDICAL AND PHARMACOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB  - Background and Objective: To evaluate the mosquito larvicidal potential of the native Bacillus thuringiensis isolate BtReX02, which was isolated from a tropical rain forest ecosystem in Malaysia. This study also aimed at determining the phenotypic and biochemical characteristics of the isolate.
   Materials and methods: The phenotypic characterization was carried out by growing the isolate in nutrient broth to observe the colonial morphology, vegetative cells, sporulation, motility and haemolytic activity. The parasporal crystal morphology was determined by Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) staining of the sporulated cells and then observed under light microscope.
   The mosquito larvicidal assay was conducted with the second instar larvae of Culex quinquefasciatus and Aedes albopictus to determine the entomocidal potency of the isolate. The total protein profile was determined by SDS-PAGE.
   Results and Discussion: Preliminary phenotypic and biochemical characterization showed that the isolate is motile, an indirect indication of the virulence of the strain and exhibited hemolytic activity, an important feature of antidipteran Bacillus thuringiensis strains. Study on the crystal morphology showed the presence of cuboidal crystals, another characteristic feature of a mosquitocidal Bacillus thuringiensis strains. Bioassay with the second instar larvae of Culex quinquefasciatus, Aedes albopictus established the antidipteran activity of this native Bacillus thuringiensis isolate. Protein profile analysis revealed the unique pattern showing high molecular mass as well as low molecular mass proteins corresponding to the Cry and Cyt proteins respectively. The protein profile is strikingly different from other mosquitocidal strains such as Bacillus thuringiensis subsp.israelensis and Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. jegathesan
   Periodical introduction of such native strains of Bacillus thuringiensis will add a new weapon in the armoury to manage the vector borne diseases and also in the management of insect resistance.

TI  - Infection Pattern of Mayaro Virus in <i>Aedes aegypti</i> (Diptera: Culicidae) and Transmission Potential of the Virus in Mixed Infections With Chikungunya Virus
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - Mayaro virus (MAYV; Togaviridae; Alphavirus) has drawn increasing attention as an arthropod-borne virus with potential to cause outbreaks among the human populations of the Western Hemisphere. In the tropical regions of Central and South America, the virus exists in sylvatic cycles between mosquitoes and primate reservoirs such as marmosets. Although forest-dwelling mosquitoes are regarded as important vectors for MAYV, it has been shown previously that the virus can infect and potentially be transmitted by the mosquitoes, Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus (Diptera: Culicidae). Here, we compare the infection and transmission efficiencies of two MAYV strains, IQT 4235 from Iquitos, Peru ('IQT') and the type strain of MAYV from Trinidad, TRVL 4675 ('TRVL') in two laboratory-adapted Ae. aegypti strains, Higgs White Eye and Orlando. The TRVL strain was less efficiently transmitted by both mosquito strains than MAYV IQT. Based on the full-length nucleotide sequences of the two viral genomes, we show that the TRVL prototype strain of MAYV is phylogenetically ancestral and more distantly related to the IQT strain. The TRVL strain efficiently infected wild-type Ae. albopictus from Missouri and readily disseminated in those. Considering scenarios in which natural MAYV transmission cycles may overlap with those of chikungunya virus (CHIKV; Togaviridae; Alphavirus), we assessed the effects of mixed infections of the two viruses in mosquitoes based on coinfection or superinfection. Although coinfection had no measurable effect on the transmission potential of either virus, we observed superinfection exclusion for CHIKV in MAYV-infected mosquitoes but not for MAYV in CHIKV-infected mosquitoes.

TI  - Effects of disturbance and site factors on sapling dynamics and species diversity in northern hardwood stands
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - The northern hardwoods forest ecosystem of eastern North America provides a wealth of products and services to human society. These forests have been managed under partial harvesting treatments to meet wood production objectives of desired species while maintaining or increasing structural and compositional heterogeneity. Few studies have examined how disturbance and site factors interactions may influence sapling dynamics and species diversity in northern hardwood forests. We used a retrospective approach to examine the impacts of disturbance and site factors on sapling (trees > 130 cm in height and < 10.0 cm dbh) dynamics and species diversity across 37 stands with time since harvest ranging from 6 to 20 years. We assessed American beech (Fagus grandifolia Ehrh), sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.), red maple (Acer rubrum L.) and yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis Britt.) saplings density as functions of disturbance intensity (% basal area cut and overstory tree mortality rate (%)) and site factors. We also examined the effects of disturbance, site factors and relative density of American beech, red maple, sugar maple and yellow birch saplings on species diversity at the sapling layer. The density of American beech saplings decreased significantly with harvest intensity. High harvest intensity significantly reduced American beech sapling density at high depth-to-water sites. However, the densities of red maple and yellow birch saplings increased significantly with increasing harvest intensity. We found that high harvest intensities had less negative effect on sugar maple sapling density compared with American beech. Our results also showed that tree species diversity (Shannon diversity index (H')) increased with harvest intensity up to about 75% and then declined. However, depth-to-water (DTW) significantly changed the magnitude of tree species diversity response to harvest intensity. Red maple appeared to have contributed more to species diversity than the other hardwood tree species. Given that sugar maple sapling density was generally higher than American beech at high harvest intensities in this study, management regimes that promote mid-tolerant species in American beech-presence stands may eventually benefit sugar maple more than American beech in these forest types. These strategies may also increase species diversity and improve forest ecosystems functions and services.

TI  - Factors associated with clinical leptospirosis: a population-based case-control study in the Seychelles (Indian Ocean)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - Background In Western countries, leptospirosis is uncommon and mainly occurs in farmers and individuals indulging in wafer-related activities. In tropical countries, leptospirosis can be up to 1000 times more frequent and risk factors for this often severe disease may differ.
   Methods We conducted a one-year population-based matched case-control study to investigate the frequency and associated factors of leptospirosis in the entire population of Seychelles.
   Results A total of 75 patients had definite acute leptospirosis based on microagglutination test (MAT) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay (incidence: 101 per 100 000 per year; 95% confidence interval [CI] : 79-126). Among the controls, MAT was positive in 37% (past infection) and PCR assay in 9% (subclinical infection) of men aged 25-64 with manual occupation. Comparing cases and controls with negative MAT and PCR, leptospirosis was associated positively with walking barefoot around the home, washing in streams, gardening, activities in forests, alcohol consumption, rainfall, wet soil around the home, refuse around the home, rats visible around the home during day time, cats in the home, skin wounds and inversely with indoor occupation. The considered factors accounted for as much as 57% of the variance in predicting the disease.
   Conclusion These data indicate a high incidence of leptospirosis in Seychelles. This suggests that leptospires are likely to be ubiquitous and that effective leptospirosis control in tropical countries needs a multifactorial approach including major behaviour change by large segments of the general public.

TI  - An Appraisal of Bird-Mediated Ecological Functions in a Changing World
T2  - TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE
AB  - Birds perform several ecological roles for ecosystem functioning and generate great benefits for human population in some circumstances. However, environmental disturbances, mostly due to anthropogenic actions, have caused a decrease of bird diversity and can lead to the loss of their functions in the remaining habitats. Here, we conducted a scientific literature review to understand the general trends on the ecosystem functions executed by birds and the possible effects of environmental disturbances on them. Our research was conducted in September 2016 in Google Scholar, Scopus, and Web of Science databases, which returned 154 papers that targeted the importance of birds to the ecosystems' maintenance. Among the studies (n = 99) that effectively assessed the ecological role of bird species, most were conducted in natural habitats (n = 63), and the most evaluated function was invertebrate population control (n = 70). About 58% of the publications related some environmental characteristic to the ecological function, but patch and landscape-scaled factors were poorly investigated. Furthermore, 52% of the papers showed that the ecological function of birds can arise from a cascade effect on other trophic levels, though this may depend on the environmental characteristics. Despite the numerous studies in the ornithology field, the ecological roles of birds in several ecosystems are still poorly understood. Future research should consider others ecological functions mediated by birds, such as disease control, and must take different spatial scales and human modification of habitats into consideration, enabling generalizations based on ecosystem type and landscape composition variation.

TI  - The Relative Impact of Climate Change on the Extinction Risk of Tree Species in the Montane Tropical Andes
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - There are widespread concerns that anthropogenic climate change will become a major cause of global biodiversity loss. However, the potential impact of climate change on the extinction risk of species remains poorly understood, particularly in comparison to other current threats. The objective of this research was to examine the relative impact of climate change on extinction risk of upper montane tree species in the tropical Andes, an area of high biodiversity value that is particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts. The extinction risk of 129 tree species endemic to the region was evaluated according to the IUCN Red List criteria, both with and without the potential impacts of climate change. Evaluations were supported by development of species distribution models, using three methods (generalized additive models, recursive partitioning, and support vector machines), all of which produced similarly high AUC values when averaged across all species evaluated (0.82, 0.86, and 0.88, respectively). Inclusion of climate change increased the risk of extinction of 18-20% of the tree species evaluated, depending on the climate scenario. The relative impact of climate change was further illustrated by calculating the Red List Index, an indicator that shows changes in the overall extinction risk of sets of species over time. A 15% decline in the Red List Index was obtained when climate change was included in this evaluation. While these results suggest that climate change represents a significant threat to tree species in the tropical Andes, they contradict previous suggestions that climate change will become the most important cause of biodiversity loss in coming decades. Conservation strategies should therefore focus on addressing the multiple threatening processes currently affecting biodiversity, rather than focusing primarily on potential climate change impacts.

TI  - Drivers of house invasion by sylvatic Chagas disease vectors in the Amazon-Cerrado transition: A multi-year, state-wide assessment of municipality-aggregated surveillance data
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   Insecticide spraying efficiently controls house infestation by triatomine bugs, the vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi. The strategy, however, is ineffective against sylvatic triatomines, which can transmit Chagas disease by invading (without colonizing) man-made structures. Despite growing awareness of the relevance of these transmission dynamics, the drivers of house invasion by sylvatic triatomines remain poorly understood.
   Methods/Findings
   About 12,000 sylvatic triatomines were caught during routine surveillance in houses of Tocantins state, Brazil, in 2005-2013. Using negative binomial regression, information-theoretic model evaluation/averaging, and external model validation, we investigated the effects of regional (Amazon/Cerrado), landscape (preservation/disturbance), and climate covariates (temperature, rainfall) on the municipality-aggregated numbers of house-invading Rhodnius pictipes, R. robustus, R. neglectus, and Panstrongylus geniculatus. House invasion by R. pictipes and R. robustus was overall more frequent in the Amazon biome, tended to increase in municipalities with more well-preserved land, and decreased in rainier municipalities. Across species, invasion decreased with higher landscape-disturbance levels and in hotter-day municipalities. Invasion by R. neglectus and P. geniculatus increased somewhat with more land at intermediate disturbance and peaked in average-rainfall municipalities. Temperature effects were more pronounced on P. geniculatus than on Rhodnius spp.
   Conclusions
   We report widespread, frequent house invasion by sylvatic triatomines in the Amazon-Cerrado transition. Our analyses indicate that readily available environmental metrics may help predict the risk of contact between sylvatic triatomines and humans at coarse geographic scales, and hint at specific hypotheses about climate and deforestation effects on those vectors-with some taxon-specific responses and some seemingly general trends. Thus, our focal species appear to be quite sensitive to higher temperatures, and might be less common in more heavily-disturbed than in better-preserved environments. This study illustrates, in sum, how entomological routine-surveillance data can be efficiently used for Chagas disease risk prediction and stratification when house-colonizing vectors are absent.

TI  - Perspective Piece Conservation Efforts and Malaria in the Brazilian Amazon
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - We respond to Valle and Clark,(1) who assert that "conservation efforts may increase malaria burden in the Brazilian Amazon," because the relationship between forest cover and malaria incidence was stronger than the effect of the deforestation rate.(1) We contend that their conclusion is flawed because of limitations in their methodology that we discuss in detail. Most important are the exclusion of one-half the original data without a discussion of selection bias, the lack of model adjustment for either population growth or migration, and the crude classifications of land cover and protected areas that lead to aggregation bias.(1) Of greater significance, we stress the need for caution in the interpretation of data that could have profound effects on regional land use decisions.

TI  - <i>Trypanosoma cruzi </i>in Triatomines and wild mammals in the National Park of <i>Serra das Confusoes</i>, Northeastern Brazil
T2  - REVISTA DA SOCIEDADE BRASILEIRA DE MEDICINA TROPICAL
AB  - Introduction: The National Park of Serra das Confusoes (NPSC) is a protected area of natural landscape located in Southern Piaui, Brazil, and it is considered as one of the largest and most important protected areas in the Caatinga biome. Methods: The natural occurrences of trypanosomatids from hemocultures on small mammals and cultures from intestinal contents triatomines were detected through molecular diagnoses of blood samples. and phylogenetic relationship analysis of the isolates parasites using the trypanosome barcode (V7V8 SSUrDNA) were realized. Results: Only two Galea spixii (8.1%) and six Triatoma brasiliensis (17.6%) were positive by hemoculture, and the isolates parasites were cryopreseived. All the isolates obtained were positioned on the Trypanosoma cruzi DTU TcI branch. Conclusions: Research focused on studying the wild animal fauna in preserved and underexplored environments has made it possible to elucidate indispensable components of different epidemiological chains of diseases with zoonotic potential.

TI  - TRANSFUSION-TRANSMITTED MALARIA: CASE REPORT OF ASYMPTOMATIC DONOR HARBORING <i>Plasmodium malariae</i>
T2  - REVISTA DO INSTITUTO DE MEDICINA TROPICAL DE SAO PAULO
AB  - Malaria in Brazil is endemic in the Amazon region, but autochthonous cases with low parasitaemia occur in the Atlantic Forest area of the country. According to Brazilian legislation no test is mandatory for blood donors from non-endemic areas. However if they have traveled to malaria transmission regions they are deferred for six months before they can donate. This report describes a transfusion-transmitted malaria case in Sao Paulo, Brazil, where one recipient received infected blood and developed the disease. He lived in Sao Paulo and had no previous transfusion or trips to endemic areas, including those of low endemicity, such as Atlantic Forest. Thick blood smears confirmed Plasmodium malariae. All donors lived in Sao Paulo and one of them (Donor 045-0) showed positive hemoscopy and PCR. This asymptomatic donor had traveled to Juquia, in the Atlantic Forest area of Sao Paulo State, where sporadic cases of autochthonous malaria are described. DNA assay revealed P. malariae in the donor's (Donor 045-0) blood. Serum archives of the recipient and of all blood donors were analyzed by ELISA using both P. vivax and P. falciparum antigens, and IFAT with P. malariae. Donor 045-0's serum was P. malariae IFAT positive and the P. vivax ELISA was reactive. In addition, two out of 44 donors' archive sera were also P. vivax ELISA reactive. All sera were P. falciparum ELISA negative. This case suggests the need of reviewing donor selection criteria and deferral strategies to prevent possible cases of transfusion-transmitted malaria.

TI  - Eyes from the sky: Application of satellite-based indices to assess vegetation casualty on Grand Bahama Island one year post-Hurricane Dorian
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
AB  - In the last two decades, major hurricanes have devastated the forest landscape of Grand Bahama. To capture the extent of the pine forest loss on Grand Bahama, we used satellite-based indices (NDVI, NDMI, and NBR) from Landsat and Sentinel-2 images and the support vector machine algorithm to estimate vegetation casualty pre-and post-Hurricane Dorian. We estimated that from 2004 to 2020, Grand Bahama lost 90.9% and 58.6% of its pine and mangrove forests, respectively. In the 15 years before Hurricane Dorian (2004-2019), stressors that included three major hurricanes (Hurricane Jeanne, Frances, and Wilma) resulted in a 44.5% (246.0 km2) loss of the pine forest vegetation on the island. Later, Hurricane Dorian, a Category 5 tropical cyclone, made landfall in Grand Bahama in 2019 and resulted in further loss of pine vegetation (46.3% of the original vegetation [256.1 km2]) and more than half of the mangrove forests after flooding 67.0% (919.3 km2) of the island. Although mean NDVI and NDMI began to exhibit pre-hurricane seasonal patterns half a year after Hurricane Dorian struck, their values remained abated one year following the storm. To account for the effects of seasonal fires, we evaluated pine vegetation for evidence of forest fires during the dry and wet cycles of the year from 2018 to 2020. We found that seasonal forest fires temporarily reduced the pine forest understory vegetation but minimally impacted the pine vegetation between the reported years. The total area of forest impacted by fires was 11.3%. These low-intensity fires burned 67.3 km2 (22.5%; 2018), 31.8 km2 (10.6%; 2019), and 21.3 km2 (7.1%; 2020) of the intact mature pine forest (299.5 km2) pre-and immediately post-Hurricane Dorian. Even though we were able to detect and map areas of pine regeneration in previously hurricane-killed pine forest, Hurricane Dorian eliminated these young pines. Overall, Grand Bahama experience a significant loss of its forest after the major hurricanes of 2004, 2005, and 2019. This research reports new findings on hurricane-related damage to the pine forest ecosystem in Grand Bahama, providing valuable information regarding the ecological consequences of severe hurricanes on these types of forests.

TI  - Mosquito feeding patterns and natural infection of vertebrates with Ross River and Barmah Forest viruses in Brisbane, Australia
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Host feeding patterns of mosquitoes were assessed through the identification of 865 blood meals collected from Brisbane during 2000-2001. Under natural conditions, mosquito feeding (including that of Culex annulirostris, Aedes vigilax, and Aedes notoscriptus) was primarily on dogs (37.4%), but also on birds (18.4%), horses (16.8%), brushtail possums (13.3%), humans (11.6%), and cats, flying foxes, and macropods, depending on site. From 1997 to 1999, sera (N = 1706) were collected from dogs, cats, horses, flying foxes, and brushtail possums in the Brisbane area and were analyzed by microneutralization assay for antibodies to Ross River virus (RRV) and Barmah Forest virus (BFV). For R,V, all vertebrate species tested had been naturally infected, and seroprevalence varied from 10.5% to 25.5%, whereas for BFV, rates varied between 0% and 11.3%. Brushtail possums were often infected in the field, with 17.6% and 10.7% of wild individuals having antibodies to RRV and BFV, respectively. Horses and flying foxes also had a relatively high prevalence of antibodies to RRV. This study, therefore, provides data to indicate that brushtail possums play a role in the urban transmission of RRV in Brisbane and that horses, when they occur, also fill the same role.

T2  - REVISTA DA SOCIEDADE BRASILEIRA DE MEDICINA TROPICAL
AB  - Introduction: Mosquitoes are vectors of several pathogens in tropical regions. However, information on Culicidae in the northeast region of Brazil is scarce despite many municipalities having environmental conditions favorable for these insects. Methods: We collected mosquitoes monthly for one year from urban, ecotonal, and ecological reserve areas in Moreno, Brazil, by using CDC Miniature light traps, aspiration, ovitraps, and liquid suction. Results: We collected 1,401 insects in the Culicidae family. Fifteen species of seven genera of Culicidae were identified and five specimens were identified only at the genus level. Conclusions: There is a wide diversity of mosquito species in the sampled areas, some of which are important for human health.

TI  - TEMPORAL CHANGES OF <i>AEDES</i> AND <i>ARMIGERES</i> POPULATIONS IN SUBURBAN AND FORESTED AREAS IN MALAYSIA
T2  - SOUTHEAST ASIAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Surveillance of mosquitoes and their distribution in association with rainfall, relative humidity, and temperature were conducted in selected suburban and forested areas, namely, Sungai Penchala (Kuala Lumpur) and Taman Alam (Selangor) for 12 months. Armigeres kesseli was the most abundant species in Sungai Penchala while Aedes butleri was the most dominant species in Taman Alam. A positive correlation between mosquito distribution and rainfall was observed in selected mosquito species in Sungai Penchala (Armigeres kesseli, r=0.75; Armigeres subalbatus, r=0.62; and Aedes albopictus, r=0.65) and Taman Alam (Armigeres sp, r=0.59; Ae. butleri, r=0.85; and Ae. albopictus, r=0.62). However, no significant correlation was found either between selected mosquito species in both study areas and relative humidity or temperature. Results obtained suggested that vector control programs to be conducted based on temporal distribution of vectors in order to achieve beneficial outcomes with effective costing.

TI  - Interactions between the tropical sea anemone <i>Aiptasia pallida</i> and <i>Serratia marcescens</i>, an opportunistic pathogen of corals
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY REPORTS
AB  - Coral reefs are under increasing stress caused by global and local environmental changes, which are thought to increase the susceptibility of corals to opportunistic pathogens. In the absence of an easily culturable model animal, the understanding of the mechanisms of disease progression in corals remains fairly limited. In the present study, we tested the susceptibility of the tropical sea anemone Aiptasia pallida to an opportunistic coral pathogen (Serratia marcescens). A.pallida was susceptible to S. marcescensPDL100 and responded to this opportunistic coral pathogen with darkening of the tissues and retraction of tentacles, followed by complete disintegration of polyp tissues. Histological observations revealed loss of zooxanthellae and structural changes in eosinophilic granular cells in response to pathogen infection. A screen of S.marcescens mutants identified a motility and tetrathionate reductase mutants as defective in virulence in the A.pallida infection model. In co-infections with the wild-type strain, the tetrathionate reductase mutant was less fit within the surface mucopolysaccharide layer of the host coral Acropora palmata.

TI  - Spatial parameters associated with the risk of banana bunchy top disease in smallholder systems
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - The Banana Bunchy Top Disease (BBTD), caused by the Banana Bunchy Top Virus (BBTV) is the most important and devastating in many tropical countries. BBTD epidemiology has been little studied, mixed landscape smallholder systems. The relative risks associated with this disease vary between geographical areas and landscapes. This work analyzed the management and vegetation conditions in smallholder gardens to assess the factors linked to landscape-level BBTV transmission and management. Mapping was done in this study area which is in a BBTD-endemic region, involving farmers actively managing the disease, but with household-level decision making. A spatial scanning statistic was used to detect and identify spatial groups at the 5% significance threshold, and a Poisson regression model was used to explore propagation vectors and the effect of surrounding vegetation and crop diversity. Spatial groups with high relative risk were identified in three communities, Dangbo, Houeyogbe, and Adjarra. Significant associations emerged between the BBTD prevalence and some crop diversity, seed systems, and BBTD management linked factors. The identified factors form important candidate management options for the detailed assessment of landscape-scale BBTD management in smallholder communities.

TI  - Implications of global environmental change for the burden of snakebite
T2  - TOXICON-X
AB  - Snakebite envenoming is a set of intoxication diseases that disproportionately affect people of poor socioeconomic backgrounds in tropical countries. As it is highly dependent on the environment its burden is expected to shift spatially with global anthropogenic environmental (climate, land use) and demographic change. The mechanisms underlying the changes to snakebite epidemiology are related to factors of snakes and humans. The distribution and abundance of snakes are expected to change with global warming via their thermal tolerance, while rainfall may affect the timing of key activities like feeding and reproduction. Human population growth is the primary cause of land-use change, which may impact snakes at smaller spatial scales than climate via habitat and biodiversity loss (e.g. prey availability). Human populations, on the other hand, could experience novel patterns and morbidity of snakebite envenoming, both as a result of snake responses to environmental change and due to the development of agricultural adaptations to climate change, socioeconomic and cultural changes, development and availability of better antivenoms, personal protective equipment, and mechanization of agriculture that mediate risk of encounters with snakes and their outcomes. The likely global effects of environmental and demographic change are thus context-dependent and could encompass both increasing and or snakebite burden (incidence, number of cases or morbidity), exposing new populations to snakes in temperate areas due to "tropicalization", or by land use change-induced snake biodiversity loss, respectively. Tackling global change requires drastic measures to ensure large-scale ecosystem functionality. However, as ecosystems represent the main source of venomous snakes their conservation should be accompanied by comprehensive public health campaigns. The challenges associated with the joint efforts of biodiversity conservation and public health professionals should be considered in the global sustainability agenda in a wider context that applies to neglected tropical and zoonotic and emerging diseases.

TI  - Climate change affecting oil palm agronomy, and oil palm cultivation increasing climate change, require amelioration
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB  - Palm oil is used in various valued commodities and is a large global industry worth over US$ 50 billion annually. Oil palms (OP) are grown commercially in Indonesia and Malaysia and other countries within Latin America and Africa. The large-scale land-use change has high ecological, economic, and social impacts. Tropical countries in particular are affected negatively by climate change (CC) which also has a detrimental impact on OP agronomy, whereas the cultivation of OP increases CC. Amelioration of both is required. The reduced ability to grow OP will reduce CC, which may allow more cultivation tending to increase CC, in a decreasing cycle. OP could be increasingly grown in more suitable regions occurring under CC. Enhancing the soil fauna may compensate for the effect of CC on OP agriculture to some extent. The effect of OP cultivation on CC may be reduced by employing reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation plans, for example, by avoiding illegal fire land clearing. Other ameliorating methods are reported herein. More research is required involving good management practices that can offset the increases in CC by OP plantations. Overall, OP-growing countries should support the Paris convention on reducing CC as the most feasible scheme for reducing CC.

TI  - Estimation of the Distribution of <i>Tabebuia guayacan</i> (Bignoniaceae) Using High-Resolution Remote Sensing Imagery
T2  - SENSORS
AB  - Species identification and characterization in tropical environments is an emerging field in tropical remote sensing. Significant efforts are currently aimed at the detection of tree species, of levels of forest successional stages, and the extent of liana occurrence at the top of canopies. In this paper we describe our use of high resolution imagery from the Quickbird Satellite to estimate the flowering population of Tabebuia guayacan trees at Barro Colorado Island (BCI), in Panama. The imagery was acquired on 29 April 2002 and 21 March 2004. Spectral Angle Mapping via a One-Class Support Vector machine was used to detect the presence of 422 and 557 flowering tress in the April 2002 and March 2004 imagery. Of these, 273 flowering trees are common to both dates. This study presents a new perspective on the effectiveness of high resolution remote sensing for monitoring a phenological response and its use as a tool for potential conservation and management of natural resources in tropical environments.

TI  - Viral Determinants and Vector Competence of Zika Virus
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) has emerged as a new global health threat. Since its first discovery in Zika forest in Uganda, this virus has been isolated from several mosquito species, including Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. The geographical distribution of these mosquito species across tropical and subtropical regions has led to several outbreaks, including the recent pandemic in Brazil, followed by the Pacific islands and other areas of North and South America. This has gained attention of the scientific community to elucidate the epidemiology and transmission of ZIKV. Despite its strong attention on clinical aspects for healthcare professionals, the relationships between ZIKV and its principal vectors, A. aegypti and A. albopictus, have not gained substantial interest in the scientific research community. As such, this review aims to summarize the current knowledge on ZIKV tropism and some important mechanisms which may be employed by the virus for effective strategies on viral survival in mosquitoes. In addition, this review identifies the areas of research that should be placed attention to, for which to be exploited for novel mosquito control strategies.

TI  - Human Seroprevalence for Dengue, Ross River, and Barmah Forest viruses in Australia and the Pacific: A systematic review spanning seven decades
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - BackgroundDengue (DENV), Ross River (RRV) and Barmah Forest viruses (BFV) are the most common human arboviral infections in Australia and the Pacific Island Countries and Territories (PICTs) and are associated with debilitating symptoms. All are nationally notifiable in Australia, but routine surveillance is limited to a few locations in the PICTs. Understanding the level of human exposure to these viruses can inform disease management and mitigation strategies. To assess the historic and current seroprevalence of DENV, RRV and BFV in Australia and the PICTs we conducted a systematic literature review of all published quantitative serosurveys. Methodology and principal findingsThe Preferred Reporting of Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses procedures were adopted to produce a protocol to systematically search for published studies reporting the seroprevalence of DENV, RRV and BFV in Australia and the PICTs. Data for author, research year, location, study population, serosurvey methods and positive tests were extracted. A total of 41 papers, reporting 78 serosurveys of DENV, RRV and BFV including 62,327 samples met the inclusion criteria for this review. Seroprevalence varied depending on the assay used, strategy of sample collection and location of the study population. Significant differences were observed in reported seropositivity depending on the sample collection strategy with clinically targeted sampling reporting the highest seroprevalence across all three viruses. Non-stratified seroprevalence showed wide ranges in reported positivity with DENV 0.0% -95.6%, RRV 0.0%-100.0%, and BFV 0.3% to 12.5%. We discuss some of the causes of variation including serological methods used, selection bias in sample collection including clinical or environmental associations, and location of study site. We consider the extent to which serosurveys reflect the epidemiology of the viruses and provide broad recommendations regarding the conduct and reporting of arbovirus serosurveys. Conclusions and significanceHuman serosurveys provide important information on the extent of human exposure to arboviruses across: (1) time, (2) place, and (3) person (e.g., age, gender, clinical presentation etc). Interpreting results obtained at these scales has the potential to inform us about transmission cycles, improve diagnostic surveillance, and mitigate future outbreaks. Future research should streamline methods and reduce bias to allow a better understanding of the burden of these diseases and the factors associated with seroprevalence. Greater consideration should be given to the interpretation of seroprevalence in studies, and increased rigour applied in linking seroprevalence to transmission dynamics.
   Author summaryMosquito-borne viruses contribute significantly to the global burden of diseases. Understanding infection rates in human populations is important for informing management of disease burden and public health policy. Serosurveys measure population exposure and immunity after arbovirus infections. We systematically reviewed serosurveys conducted for dengue virus (DENV), Ross River virus (RRV), and Barmah Forest virus (BFV) in Australia and the PICTs. We identified 41 studies reporting 78 serosurveys published between 1966 and 2020. For DENV we found the highest seroprevalence, greater than 95.0%, was reported in American Samoa. For RRV we found early evidence (1960-1969) of circulation outside Australia. There were three studies of BFV reporting 16 serosurveys within Australia and reporting low seroprevalence (<13%). Researchers used different serological methods so study comparisons must be nuanced.

TI  - Bioaccumulation of selenium-by fruit origin lactic acid bacteria in tropical fermented fruit juices
T2  - LWT-FOOD SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB  - Adequate fruit consumption helps to prevent several chronic age-related diseases. Selenium (Se) is an elemental micronutrient with antioxidant capacity. In general, fruits and Se ingest by humans are below the recommended daily intake value. Fresh fruits are highly susceptible to deterioration during storage. Fermentation can improve the storage period, sensory profile, and bioactive compound content of foods; moreover, some lactic acid bacteria can accumulate organic Se intracellularly. In this work, microbial growth and Se accumulation by Levilactobacillus brevis CRL2051 and Fructobacillus tropaeoli CRL2034 in tropical fruit juices were evaluated. The strains could grow 1-2 log cfu/mL, alone or combined, in mango, passion fruit, and mango/passion fruit juices, although they could not completely eliminate native microorganisms in unpasteurised juices. In pasteurised trials, both strains consumed fruit carbohydrates producing lactic acid, in addition to acetic acid, and mannitol by F. tropaeoli. Both strains accumulated Se intracellularly in the fruit juices, especially (123.0 mu g/L) in the passion fruit juice fermented by the mixed culture. Finally, the Fructobacillus strain increased 3.42 times the phenolic compound concentration in the mango/passion fruit juice with added Se after 24 h. The assayed LAB strains could be used for preparing functional fermented fruit beverages bio-enriched in Se.

TI  - Effectiveness of Mistletoe Seed Dispersal by Tyrant Flycatchers in a Mixed Andean Landscape
T2  - BIOTROPICA
AB  - The dependence of mistletoes on few dispersers and the directed dispersal they provide is well known, yet no recent work has quantified either the effectiveness of these legitimate' dispersers, or the extent of redundancy among them. Here, I use the seed dispersal effectiveness (SDE) framework to analyze how birds (Mionectes striaticollis and Zimmerius bolivianus) contribute to mistletoe (Struthanthus acuminatus and Phthirusa retroflexa) infection in traditional mixed plantations within a humid montane forest in Bolivia. I calculated SDE for each birdmistletoe pair and for the disperser assemblage, by estimating both the quantity and the quality of dispersal. The quantity of dispersal was measured as: (1) disperser abundance; (2) frequency of visits; and (3) number of seeds dispersed per visit, and the quality of dispersal was measured as: (1) germination percentage and speed of germination of seeds regurgitated by birds; and (2) the concordance of deposited seeds and seedling distribution patterns with adult mistletoe distribution at three scales (habitat, host, and microhabitat). Dispersers were not redundant: the more generalist species M. striaticollis dispersed more seeds, but provided lower quality seed dispersal, whereas the mistletoe specialist Z. bolivianus provided low-quantity and high-quality seed dispersal. Whereas S. acuminatus benefited more from the SDE of Z. bolivianus, P. retroflexa benefited from the complementary seed dispersal provided by both birds. These results demonstrate how sympatric mistletoes that share the same disperser assemblage may develop different relationships with specific vectors, and describe how the services provided by two different dispersers (one that provides high-quality and one that provides high-quantity dispersal) interact to shape spatial patterns of plants. Resumen El que los muerdagos dependan de pocos dispersores y de la dispersion directa que estos proveen, es un fenomeno bastante conocido, sin embargo no existen estudios recientes que cuantifiquen la efectividad de estos dispersores legitimos', o el grado de redundancia entre ellos. Aqui utilizo el marco teorico de efectividad de dispersion de semillas (SDE) para analizar como las aves (Mionectes striaticollis y Zimmerius bolivianus) contribuyen a la infeccion por muerdagos (Struthanthus acuminatus y Phthirusa retroflexa) en plantaciones mixtas tradicionales dentro de un bosque humedo montano de Bolivia. Calcule el SDE para cada par ave-muerdago y para el ensamble de dispersores, estimando la cantidad de dispersion medida como (1) la abundancia de dispersores, (2) la frecuencia de visitas y (3) el numero de semillas dispersadas por visita, y la calidad de dispersion medida como (1) el porcentaje y la velocidad de germinacion de semillas regurgitadas por aves y (2) la concordancia de semillas depositadas y de plantulas de lorantaceas con los patrones de distribucion de muerdagos adultos en tres escalas (habitat, hospedero y microhabitat). Los dispersores no son redundantes, la especie mas generalista M. striaticollis dispersa mas semillas pero provee dispersion de baja calidad, mientras que el especialista en muerdagos Z. bolivianus provee dispersion de baja cantidad y alta calidad. Mientras S. acuminatus se beneficia del SDE que provee un dispersor (Z. bolivianus), P. retroflexa se beneficia de la dispersion complementaria que proveen ambas aves.
   Estos resultados ejemplifican como muerdagos simpatricos, que comparten el mismo ensamble de dispersores, pueden desarrollar diferentes relaciones con determinados vectores, y describe como los servicios de dispersion provistos por dos dispersores diferentes (uno que provee alta cantidad y uno alta calidad de dispersion) interactuan para modelar los patrones espaciales de las plantas que dispersan.

TI  - An algorithm based on molecular protocols to improve the detection of<i> Plasmodium</i> in autochthonous malarial areas in the Atlantic Forest biome
T2  - REVISTA DO INSTITUTO DE MEDICINA TROPICAL DE SAO PAULO
AB  - Malaria is the most important vector-borne disease in the world and a challenge for control programs. In Brazil, 99% of cases occur in the Amazon region. In the extra-Amazonian region, a non-endemic area, epidemiological surveillance focuses on imported malaria and on autochthonous outbreaks, including cases with mild symptoms and low parasitemia acquired in the Atlantic Forest biome. In this scenario, cases are likely to be underreported, since submicroscopic parasitemias are not detected by thick blood smear, considered the reference test. Molecular tests are more sensitive, detecting asymptomatic individuals and mixed infections. The aim of this study was to propose a more efficient alternative to detect asymptomatic individuals living in areas of low malaria endemicity, as they are reservoirs of Plasmodium that maintain transmission locally. In total, 955 blood samples from residents of 16 municipalities with autochthonous malaria outbreaks in the Sao Paulo State were analyzed; 371 samples were collected in EDTA tubes and 584 in filter paper. All samples were initially screened by a genus-specific qPCR targeting ssrRNA genes (limit of detection of 1 parasite/ mu L). Then, positive samples were subjected to a nested PCR targeting ssrRNA and dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase genes (limit of detection of 10 parasites/mu L) to determine Plasmodium species. The results showed a statistically significant difference (K = 0.049; p < 0.0001) between microscopy positivity (6.9%) and qPCR (22.9%) for EDTA-blood samples. Conversely, for samples collected in filter paper, no statistical difference was observed, with 2.6% positivity by thick blood smear and 3.1% for qPCR (K = 0.036; p = 0.7). Samples positive by qPCR were assayed by a species-specific nested PCR that was in turn positive in 26% of samples (16 P. vivax and 4 P. malariae). The results showed that molecular protocols applied to blood samples from residents in areas with autochthonous transmission of malaria were useful to detect asymptomatic patients who act as a source of transmission. The results showed that the genus-specific qPCR was useful for screening positives, with the subsequent identification of species by nested PCR. Additional improvements, such as standardization of blood plotting on filter paper and a more sensitive protocol for species determination, are essential. The qPCR-based algorithm for screening positives followed by nested PCR will contribute to more efficient control of malaria transmission, offering faster and more sensitive tools to detect asymptomatic Plasmodium reservoirs.

TI  - Monitoring mangrove association changes in the Can Gio biosphere reserve and implications for management
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Mangrove forests are useful in protecting coastal lines, reducing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), and providing shelters and foods for ecosystems, but they are among the top threatened habitats worldwide caused by human activities, climate change, and coastal-related natural disasters such as tsunami, flood, storm, etc. Understanding quantitative and spatial information of mangrove associations is essential for managing mangrove forests effectively. The main aim of this research is to investigate the changes of mangrove forest associations in tropical regions and possible reasons of changes via the case study of the Can Gio biosphere reserve in Viet Nam by using remote sensing datasets (SPOT 4 and 5 imagery), object-based image analysis and Support Vector Machine classifier. The classification results showed that the highest overall accuracy of this combination was 81.6%, given 420 reference objects, confirming the applicability of using remote sensing on assessing the development of mangrove forests. For the case study, we found that there was a decrease of the Avicennia alba - Sonneratia alba (Association I) area by 20.1% caused by the development of aquaculture and other human activities, but there was an increase of the Rhizophora apiculata (Association II) area by 34.8%. These trends may result in the exacerbated risk of soil erosion and make the region become more vulnerable to climate change and tropical storm events. Management policies should be revised to harmonise the benefits of economic development, environmental protection, and species diversity.

TI  - Genetic characterization of the rare Bruconha virus<i> (Bunyavirales:</i><i> Orthobunyavirus)</i> isolated in Vale do Ribeira (Atlantic Forest biome), Southeastern Brazil
T2  - REVISTA DO INSTITUTO DE MEDICINA TROPICAL DE SAO PAULO
AB  - Brazil is a great source of arbovirus diversity, mainly in the Amazon region. However, other biomes, especially the Atlantic Forest, may also be a hotspot for emerging viruses, including Bunyaviruses (Negarnaviricota: Bunyavirales). For instance, Vale do Ribeira, located in the Southeastern region, has been widely studied for virus surveillance, where Flavivirus, Alphavirus and Bunyaviruses were isolated during the last decades, including Bruconha virus (BRCV), a member of Orthobunyavirus genus Group C, in 1976. Recently, a new isolate of BRCV named Span321532 was obtained from an adult sentinel mouse placed in Iguape city in 2011, and a full-length genome was generated with nucleotide differences ranging between 1.5%, 5.3% and 5% (L, M and S segments, respectively) from the prototype isolated 35 years earlier. In addition, each segment placed BRCV into different clusters, showing the high variety within Bunyavirales. Although no evidence for reassortants was detected, this finding reiterates the need for new surveillance and genomic studies in the area considering the high mutation rates of arbovirus, and also to identify the hosts capable of supporting the continuous circulation of Orthobunyavirus.

T2  - AFRICAN BIODIVERSITY: MOLECULES, ORGANISMS, ECOSYSTEMS
CP  - 5th International Symposium on Tropical Biology
AB  - The Murid rodent diversity has been sampled following the 9(th) Meridian in the cast of Guinea from the forest region to Sudanian savannas of southern Mali. This represents the first small mammals survey in North Guinea. Murid diversity patterns have been researched using correspondence analysis and faunal comparisons. A difference between southern forest communities and northern ones is observed. Mastomys natalensis is found only in houses in southern Guinea while in the north it is found in all sampled habitats. M erythroleucus is absent from the forest zone, but found from the ecotone forest-savanna to the north, and it seems that this species never enter houses. Implications for Lassa fever transmission are discussed.

A1  - Venezuelan Dengue Fever Working
TI  - A Three-Component Biomarker Panel for Prediction of Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Dengue virus infections are a major cause of morbidity in tropical countries. Early detection of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) may help identify individuals that would benefit from intensive therapy. Predictive modeling was performed using 11 laboratory values of 51 individuals (38 DIP and 13 DHF) obtained on initial presentation using logistic regression. We produced a robust model with an area under the curve of 0.9615 that retained IL-10 levels, platelets, and lymphocytes as the major predictive features. A classification and regression tree was developed on these features that were 86% accurate on cross-validation. The IL-.10 levels and platelet counts were also identified as the most informative features associated with DHF using a Random Forest classifier. In the presence of polymerase chain reaction-proven acute dengue infections, we suggest a complete blood count and rapid measurement of IL-10 can assist in the triage of potential DHF cases for close follow-up or clinical intervention improving clinical outcome.

TI  - THE POTENTIAL OF NATURAL XANTHONE a-MANGOSTIN IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF NOVEL ANTIINFECTIVE AGENTS: A REVIEW
T2  - QUIMICA NOVA
AB  - The mangosteen (Garcinia mangostana, Linn.) is a tropical fruit cultivated in the tropical forests of Southeast Asian countries. It is recognized as the queen of fruits due to its unique color, aroma, and flavor. It has been used for centuries in Southeastern Asian traditional medicine for the treatment of various diseases. Many functional molecules with high medicinal value are obtained from the pericarp of mangosteen fruit, whose major constituent is xanthone alpha-mangostin. Several studies have been carried out over the last decades to further investigate and understand the pharmacological properties associated with the plant and its main chemical constituents, belonging to the class of xanthones. In addition, numerous in vitro and in vivo studies related to mangosteen have been published, indicating its importance and its potential application in medicinal chemistry. Prenylated xanthones, which include alpha-mangostin, are secondary metabolites particularly common in plants belonging to the Clusiaceae family. These substances have been intensively investigated for their potential as biologically active agents. This article describes a critical analysis of published data related to the properties of alpha-mangostin, aiming to provide a more detailed view of its potential as a chemotherapeutic agent for the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases.

TI  - Wide Distribution and Genetic Diversity of <i>Babesia microti</i> in Small Mammals from Yunnan Province, Southwestern China
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   Babesia, usually found in wild and domestic mammals worldwide, have recently been responsible for emerging malaria-like zoonosis in infected patients. Human B. microti infection has been identified in China, primarily in the Southwest along the Myanmar border but little direct surveillance of B. microti infection in rodents has been carried out here (Yunnan province). In this region, a diverse topographic range combined with tropical moisture sustains a high biodiversity of small mammals, which might play important role on Babesia transmission.
   Methods
   Small mammals were captured in 141 sample locations from 18 counties located Yunnan Province, and screened for B. microti-like parasites infection by a nested PCR to target 18S rRNA gene of Babesia, plus directly sequencing for positive samples. Univariate and multivariate forward stepwise logistic regression analysis was used to access the association between infections and some related risk factors.
   Results
   Infection with Babesia microti was confirmed in 2.4% (53/2204) of small mammals. Significant differences in prevalence rates of B. microti were observed based on variations in forest, agricultural, and residential landscapes. Furthermore, adult small mammals had higher prevalence rates than younger, pubertal mammals. The near full-length 18S rRNA gene revealed that there were two types of B. microti, Kobe and Otsu, which demonstrate the genetic diversity and regional distribution.
   Conclusions
   There exists a wide distribution and genetic diversity of endemic B. microti in Southwestern China, warranting further investigations and monitoring of clinical disease in individuals presenting with Babesia like symptoms in these areas.

TI  - Crossing the threshold: an amphibian assemblage highly infected with <i>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</i> in the southern Brazilian Atlantic forest
T2  - STUDIES ON NEOTROPICAL FAUNA AND ENVIRONMENT
AB  - The fungal infection caused by Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) in amphibians is known to be lethal when infection intensity values exceed loads of 10,000 zoospores per individual. We investigated Bd infection intensity in 100 anurans of southern Brazil. Almost half of the individuals were infected and the intensity ranged from four to about 156,000 zoospore genomic equivalents. We found no clinical signs of chytridiomycosis and no evidence of mortality. However, we observed a reduction in the number of infected individuals with loads above 10,000 zoospores. This fact could be considered indirect evidence that individuals with high loads are removed from the population.

TI  - HIV INHIBITORY NATURAL-PRODUCTS .7. THE CALANOLIDES, A NOVEL HIV-INHIBITORY CLASS OF COUMARIN DERIVATIVES FROM THE TROPICAL RAIN-FOREST TREE, CALOPHYLLUM-LANIGERUM
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY
AB  - Eight new coumarin compounds (1-8) were isolated by anti-HIV bioassay-guided fractionation of an extract of Calophyllum lanigerum.  The structures of calanolide A (1), 12-acetoxycalanolide A (2), 12-methyoxycalanolide A (3), calanolide B (4), 12-methoxycalanolide B (5), calanolide C (6) and related derivatives 7 and 8 were solved by extensive spectroscopic analyses, particularly HMQC, HMBC, and difference NOE NMR experiments.  The absolute stereochemistry of calanolide A (1) and calanolide B (4) was established by a modified Mosher's method.  Calanolides A (1) and B (4) were completely protective against HIV-1 replication and cytopathicity (EC50 values of 0.1-mu-M and 0.4-mu-M, respectively), but were inactive against HIV-2.  Some of the related compounds also showed evidence of anti-HIV-1 activity.  Studies with purified bacterial recombinant reverse transcriptases (RT) revealed that the calanolides are HIV-1 specific RT inhibitors.  Moreover, calanolide A was active not only against the AZT-resistant G-9106 strain of HIV-1 but also against the pyridinone-resistant A17 strain.  This was of particular interest since the A17 virus is highly resistant to previously known HIV-1 specific, non-nucleoside RT inhibitors (e.g., TIBO; BI-RG-587; L693,593) which comprise a structurally diverse but apparently common pharmacologic class.  The calanolides represent a substantial departure from the known class and therefore provide a novel new anti-HIV chemotype for drug development.

TI  - Historic and recent status of the Kosrae flying fox (<i>Pteropus ualanus</i>) (Chiroptera: Pteropidae) on Kosrae, Micronesia
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIA-PACIFIC BIODIVERSITY
AB  - Seven species of flying foxes of the genus Pteropus have been described from the Caroline Islands and Mariana Islands of Micronesia. Among the five extant species, P. ualanus of Kosrae is the least studied. We review the history of research on P. ualanus and summarize data from recent surveys. Early historical accounts suggest that P. ualanus was abundant until a severe population bottleneck, attributed to an infectious disease, allegedly reduced the population to two individuals during 1926-1927. During 1982 and 1983, we found three colonies and a minimum of 600-700 bats in the mountains. Subsequently two new colonies became established in coastal localities by 1994 and 2002 and currently represent the largest colonies. During 2013 and 2014, Hayes visited four confirmed and two possible colonies (three in the mountains, three along the coast) ranging in size from two to 1038 individuals and counted a minimum of 1765 individuals. Long-term changes occurred in the size of colonies. Because not all individuals were counted and at least one other colony likely exists, the population probably exceeds 2000 and may exceed 3000 individuals. The population may not have reached its carrying capacity and may still be increasing. Potential existential threats include infectious disease, typhoons, overhunting, and habitat loss.

TI  - Ecology and Conservation of Baird's tapir in Mexico
T2  - TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE
AB  - Baird's tapir (Tapirus bairdii) is endangered primarily because of habitat loss and fragmentation, and overhunting throughout its distribution range (ca. 21,000 km(2)) in the Mexican states of Campeche, Chiapas, Quintana Roo, Oaxaca, Veracruz, and possibly Yucatan and Tabasco. The number of tapirs occurring in Mexico is estimated around 2,600 individuals, which are also threatened by factors such as forest fires, large-scale infrastructure projects (building of dams and highways), disease transmission from domestic animals, pollution of water bodies, and global climatic change effects. A strategy for tapir conservation in Mexico should include: 1) protection and management of extant habitat; 2) creation and maintaining of corridors among isolated forest fragments containing tapirs; 3) community-based control of poaching; 4) development of economic alternatives for people living near tapir habitat; 5) captive breeding programs with educational, scientific, and conservationist purposes; 6) environmental education and communication programs in rural and urban areas near tapir habitat; and 7) research on distribution, abundance, habitat use and availability, population status, movement patterns, feeding habits, genetic variability, interactions with domestic species, diseases, and responses to habitat fragmentation, hunting, and global climatic change.

TI  - Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 in Nasopharyngeal Samples from Patients with COVID-19 Illustrates Population Variation and Diverse Phenotypes, Placing the Growth Properties of Variants of Concern in Context with Other Lineages
T2  - MSPHERE
AB  - New variants of SARS-CoV-2 are continuing to emerge and dominate the global sequence landscapes. Several variants have been labeled variants of concern (VOCs) because they may have a transmission advantage, increased risk of morbidity and/or mortality, or immune evasion upon a background of prior infection or vaccination. Placing the VOCs in context with the underlying variability of SARS-CoV-2 is essential in understanding virus evolution and selection pressures. Dominant genome sequences and the population genetics of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swabs from hospitalized patients were characterized. Nonsynonymous changes at a minor variant level were identified. These populations were generally preserved when isolates were amplified in cell culture. To place the Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Omicron VOCs in context, their growth was compared to clinical isolates of different lineages from earlier in the pandemic. The data indicated that the growth in cell culture of the Beta variant was more than that of the other variants in Vero E6 cells but not in hACE2-A549 cells. Looking at each time point, Beta grew more than the other VOCs in hACE2-A549 cells at 24 to 48 h postinfection. At 72 h postinfection there was no difference in the growth of any of the variants in either cell line. Overall, this work suggested that exploring the biology of SARS-CoV-2 is complicated by population dynamics and that these need to be considered with new variants. In the context of variation seen in other coronaviruses, the variants currently observed for SARS-CoV-2 are very similar in terms of their clinical spectrum of disease. IMPORTANCE SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of COVID-19. The virus has spread across the planet, causing a global pandemic. In common with other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 genomes can become quite diverse as a consequence of replicating inside cells. This has given rise to multiple variants from the original virus that infected humans. These variants may have different properties and in the context of a widespread vaccination program may render vaccines less effective. Our research confirms the degree of genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 in patients. By comparing the growth of previous variants to the pattern seen with four variants of concern (VOCs) (Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Omicron), we show that, at least in cells, Beta variant growth exceeds that of Alpha, Delta, and Omicron VOCs at 24 to 48 h in both Vero E6 and hACE2-A549 cells, but by 72 h postinfection, the amount of virus is not different from that of the other VOCs.
   SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of COVID-19. The virus has spread across the planet, causing a global pandemic.

TI  - The Chagas disease study landscape: A systematic review of clinical and observational antiparasitic treatment studies to assess the potential for establishing an individual participant-level data platform
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   Chagas disease (CD), caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, affects similar to 6-7 million people worldwide. Significant limitations still exist in our understanding of CD. Harnessing individual participant data (IPD) from studies could support more in-depth analyses to address the many outstanding research questions. This systematic review aims to describe the characteristics and treatment practices of clinical studies in CD and assess the breadth and availability of research data for the potential establishment of a data-sharing platform.
   Methodology/Principal findings
   This review includes prospective CD clinical studies published after 1997 with patients receiving a trypanocidal treatment. The following electronic databases and clinical trial registry platforms were searched: Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, LILACS, Scielo, Clintrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP. Of the 11,966 unique citations screened, 109 (0.9%) studies (31 observational and 78 interventional) representing 23,116 patients were included. Diagnosis for patient enrolment required 1 positive test result in 5 (4.6%) studies (2 used molecular method, 1 used molecular and serology, 2 used serology and parasitological methods), 2 in 60 (55.0%), 3 in 14 (12.8%) and 4 or more in 4 (3.7%) studies. A description of treatment regimen was available for 19,199 (83.1%) patients, of whom 14,605 (76.1%) received an active treatment and 4,594 (23.9%) were assigned to a placebo/no-treatment. Of the 14,605 patients who received an active treatment, benznidazole was administered in 12,467 (85.4%), nifurtimox in 825 (5.6%), itraconazole in 284 (1.9%), allopurinol in 251(1.7%) and other drugs in 286 (1.9%). Assessment of efficacy varied largely and was based primarily on biological outcome; parasitological efficacy relied on serology in 67/85 (78.8%) studies, molecular methods in 52/85 (61.2%), parasitological in 34/85 (40.0%), microscopy in 3/85 (3.5%) and immunohistochemistry in 1/85 (1.2%). The median time at which parasitological assessment was carried out was 79 days [interquartile range (IQR): 30-180] for the first assessment, 180 days [IQR: 60-500] for second, and 270 days [IQR: 18-545] for the third assessment.
   Conclusions/Significance
   This review demonstrates the heterogeneity of clinical practice in CD treatment and in the conduct of clinical studies. The sheer volume of potential IPD identified demonstrates the potential for development of an IPD platform for CD and that such efforts would enable indepth analyses to optimise the limited pharmacopoeia of CD and inform prospective data collection.

TI  - Mortality trends in the African cherry (<i>Prunus africana</i>) and the implications for colobus monkeys (<i>Colobus guereza</i>) in Kakamega Forest, Kenya
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Prunus africana (Hook.f.) Kalkm. is a secondary forest canopy tree species that has been declining over much of its geographical range in sub-Saharan Africa during recent decades due to unsustainable harvesting of its bark for the international medicinal plant trade. One of the locations where the species is experiencing rapid mortality is Isecheno study site in the Kakamega Forest, Kenya where this study was conducted. Between 1997 and 2003, 21% of the P. africana (greater than or equal to 10 cm DBH) at Isecheno died and an additional 9% experienced greater than or equal to 50% canopy dieback. However, scars from bark harvesting on P. africana were relatively small and scarred trees were not more likely to be dead or dying than unscarred trees, suggesting that bark exploitation is not causing P. africana mortality at Isecheno. Other possible causes that require further evaluation include disease, insect attack, nutrient deficiency, and/or climatic fluctuation. The poor regeneration of P. africana at Isecheno can likely be explained by the relative lack of recent disturbance coupled with the thick undergrowth layer at this site. P. africana mortality is of concern not only because the species is listed as Vulnerable by IUCN, but also because black and white colobus monkeys [Colobus guereza (Ruppell, 1835)] at Isecheno exploit it as their top food species and are particularly reliant on its leaves during times of 'preferred' Moraceae fruit scarcity. The anticipated continued decline of P. africana may have adverse effects on C. guereza feeding habits, intergroup relations, and population density at Isecheno. Conservation of P. africana offers a formidable challenge since the species appears to require disturbance for regeneration, yet at sites where disturbance is occurring, P. africana is often a target of bark harvesters engaging in unsustainable levels of exploitation.

TI  - Potential risk factors associated with human alveolar echinococcosis: Systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   Human alveolar echinococcosis (AE) is a severe zoonotic disease caused by the metacestode stage of Echinococcus multilocularis. AE is commonly associated with a long incubation period that may last for more than ten years. The objective of this systematic literature review was to identify and summarize the current knowledge on statistically relevant potential risk factors (PRFs) associated with AE in humans.
   Methodology/Principal findings
   Six bibliographic databases were searched, generating a total of 1,009 publications. Following the removal of duplicate records and the exclusion of papers that failed to meet the criteria of a previously agreed a priori protocol, 23 publications were retained; however, 6 of these did not contain data in a format that allowed their inclusion in the meta-analysis. The remaining 17 publications (6 case-control and 11 cross-sectional studies) were meta-analysed to investigate associations between AE and PRFs. Pooled odds ratios (OR) were used as a measure of effect and separately analysed for case-control and cross-sectional studies. In the case-control studies, the following PRFs for human AE showed higher odds of outcome: dog ownership, cat ownership, have a kitchen garden, occupation: farmer, haymaking in meadows not adjacent to water, went to forests for vocational reasons, chewed grass and hunting / handling foxes. In the cross-sectional studies, the following PRFs showed higher odds of outcome: dog ownership, play with dogs, gender: female, age over 20 years, ethnic group: Tibetan, low income, source of drinking water other than well or tap, occupation: herding and low education. Our meta-analysis confirmed that the chance of AE transmission through ingestion of food and water contaminated with E. multilocularis eggs exists, but showed also that food- and water-borne PRFs do not significantly increase the risk of infection.
   Conclusions/significance
   This systematic review analysed international peer-reviewed articles that have over the years contributed to our current understanding of the epidemiology of human AE. The identification of potential risk factors may help researchers and decision makers improve surveillance and/or preventive measures that aim at decreasing human infection with E. multilocularis. More primary studies are needed to confirm potential risk factors and their role in the epidemiology of human AE.

TI  - Vanilla flavor: Species from the Atlantic forest as natural alternatives
T2  - FOOD CHEMISTRY
AB  - The volatility of the vanilla market calls attention to the so-called vanilla crisis. There is a growing worldwide demand for natural vanilla with a concomitant reduction in global supply. However, commercial crops are threatened with extinction due to the lack of gene pool variability, susceptibility to climate change and pandemic diseases. Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify new Vanilla spp. as alternative sources vanilla. Therefore, using undirected LC-MS/MS metabolic profiling and chemometrics, the present study demonstrates the great bioeconomic potential of two Atlantic Forest species - V. bahiana and V. chamissonis - by annotation of important flavor compounds associated with the commercial species and reveals distinct flavor descriptors associated with both wild species. Such similarities and dissimilarities are crucial to the ongoing quest to Vanilla gene pool improvement. Compounds remarkably and frequently associated with vanilla flavor were annotated or identified in this study such as vanillin and p-hydroxybenzaldehyde.

TI  - Detection of yellow fever virus by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in wild monkeys:: a sensitive tool for epidemiologic surveillance
T2  - BIOMEDICA
AB  - Introduction. Yellow fever is a zoonotic infection maintained in nature by non-human primates. Appropriate surveillance with sensitive laboratory techniques is necessary to evidence viral activity in the tropical forest habitats of these primates.
   Objective. Yellow fever virus was detected in hepatic tissue samples from non-human primates by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique using specific primers for diagnosis.
   Materials and methods. Hepatic tissue samples were processed from five monkeys belonging genus Alouatta spp found dead in sylvatic areas of Cesar and Magdalena Provinces, Colombia, between December 2003 and June 2004. Samples were treated with lysis buffer prior to the isolation of viral RNA, which was then subjected to reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using yellow fever-specific primers. Simultaneously, viral proteins were identified by immunohistochemistry on parafin-embedded hepatic tissue.
   Results. The PCR method amplified fragments of the expected size (424 bp) in four of the tested samples. In addition, these samples showed a positive reaction by immunohistochemistry, supporting the evidence that the virus was present.
   Conclusion. The detection of yellow fever virus in wild monkeys was clear evidence of enzootic activity in northern Colombia. Increased probability of yellow fever transmission among human populations is indicated due to urbanization processes as a consequence of forced migration and displacement of the human populations. Molecular tests for rapid and specific detection of yellow fever in tissue samples of non-human primates is an important tool for epidemiologic surveillance. Rapid virus identification will permit the timely activation of control systems for prevention of further cases and epidemic situations.

TI  - Hyperdominance in fruit production in the Brazilian Atlantic rain forest: the functional role of plants in sustaining frugivores
T2  - BIOTROPICA
AB  - The availability of fruits is critical for tropical forests, where the majority of plant species rely upon animal vectors for seed dispersal. However, we do not know how fruit production is temporally distributed over species and families. Two plant families are particularly important in floristic inventories of Atlantic rain forests: Arecaceae, a few species of which are highly abundant; and Myrtaceae, which is abundant and displays outstanding species diversity. In this context, we asked whether hyperdominance occurs in fruit production in the Atlantic rain forest, and whether it occurs in the abundant species of Arecaceae and Myrtaceae. We investigated whether the temporal fruit production patterns differ between Myrtaceae, Arecaceae, and the plant community as a whole. We also applied a functional dispersion index to assess the temporal fruit diversity over a 2-yr period, with regard to morphological and phenological traits. We found that the phenomenon of hyperdominance occurs in fruit production: five species accounted for more than half of the pulp biomass. Arecaceae fruit biomass peaked at the end of wet season, overlapping with the community peak; whereas Myrtaceae species fruited throughout the year and were an important resource during periods of food scarcity. Myrtaceae filled more of the fruit morphospace over time because their fruits exhibit a large range of morphologies and phenological strategies. Our results demonstrated the importance of combining phenology and fruit morphology in the evaluation of resource availability, which revealed periods of high fruit diversity that could support a range of frugivore sizes and maintain overall ecosystem functionality.
   Resumo A disponibilidade de frutos e critica para as florestas tropicais onde a maioria das plantas depende dos animais como vetores para a dispersAo de suas sementes. Porem, nos nAo sabemos como a producAo de frutos esta temporalmente distribuida nas especies e familias. Duas familias de plantas sAo particularmente importantes nos levantamentos floristicos da floresta Atlantica: Arecaceae devido a alta abundancia de poucas especies e Myrtaceae devido a elevada abundancia e grande diversidade de especies. Neste contexto, nos perguntamos se existe hiperdominancia na producAo de frutos em Floresta Atlantica e se ela ocorre nas especies abundantes de Myrtaceae e Arecaceae. Nos investigamos se os padroes temporais de producAo de frutos diferem entre Myrtaceae, Arecaceae e o restante da comunidade de plantas. Nos tambem aplicamos um indice de dispersAo funcional, que combina caracteristicas morfologicas dos frutos e fenologia da frutificacAo, para avaliar a diversidade temporal de frutos produzida ao longo de um periodo de dois anos. Nos encontramos que o fenomeno de hiperdominancia ocorre na producAo de frutos: cinco especies foram responsaveis por mais da metade da biomassa de polpa produzida. O pico da biomassa de frutos de Arecaceae ocorreu no final da estacAo umida, sobrepondo com o pico da comunidade; ao passo que Myrtaceae frutificou durante ano todo e foi um importante recurso nos periodos de escassez de alimento. Myrtaceae preencheu mais o morfo-espaco dos frutos ao longo do tempo, porque seus frutos exibem uma maior variacAo morfologica e diversas estrategias fenologicas. Nossos resultados demonstraram a importancia de combinar caracteres fenologicos e morfologicos dos frutos na avaliacAo da disponibilidade de recursos. Essa abordagem permite identificar periodos de alta diversidade funcional de frutos que poderiam sustentar frugivoros de diversos tamanhos e manter a funcionalidade global do ecossistema.

TI  - Jumping into a trap: high prevalence of chytrid fungus in the preferred microhabitats of a bromeliad-specialist frog
T2  - DISEASES OF AQUATIC ORGANISMS
AB  - The chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) has been identified as a major threat to several amphibian populations in tropical forests. Amphibians that inhabit the phytotelmata (water tanks) of bromeliads may be especially at risk of Bd infection since the humid, environmentally buffered microhabitat that they prefer might also be favorable for Bd persistence on the host. To test this hypothesis, we sampled adults and tadpoles of the bromeligenous anuran Phyllodytes edelmoi (endemic to the northern Brazilian Atlantic Forest) from the bromeliad Portea leptantha for Bd, using qPCR. We also analyzed 8 bromeliad characteristics: water tank temperature and pH, canopy closure, tank diameter, number of leaves, bromeliad maximum column depth to store water, bromeliad relative volume, and season. Adult frogs preferentially selected bromeliads with a smaller diameter, more leaves and a relatively higher volume of water. We found that Bd was more prevalent in frogs inhabiting bromeliad phytotelmata with smaller diameters, suggesting that the behavioral preferences of P. edelmoi may be driving Bd infection patterns. Therefore, species such as P. edelmoi will be trapped by their own natural history traits.

TI  - The environmental drivers of bacterial meningitis epidemics in the Democratic Republic of Congo, central Africa
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Introduction Bacterial meningitis still constitutes an important threat in Africa. In the meningitis belt, a clear seasonal pattern in the incidence of meningococcal disease during the dry season has been previously correlated with several environmental parameters like dust and sand particles as well as the Harmattan winds. In parallel, the evidence of seasonality in meningitis dynamics and its environmental variables remain poorly studied outside the meningitis belt. This study explores several environmental factors associated with meningitis cases in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), central Africa, outside the meningitis belt area. Methods Non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis' tests were used to establish the difference between the different health zones, climate and vegetation types in relation to both the number of cases and attack rates for the period 2000-2018. The relationships between the number of meningitis cases for the different health zones and environmental and socio-economical parameters collected were modeled using different generalized linear (GLMs) and generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs), and different error structure in the different models, i.e., Poisson, binomial negative, zero-inflated binomial negative and more elaborated multi-hierarchical zero-inflated binomial negative models, with randomization of certain parameters or factors (health zones, vegetation and climate types). Comparing the different statistical models, the model with the smallest Akaike's information criterion (AIC) were selected as the best ones. 515 different health zones from 26 distinct provinces were considered for the construction of the different GLM and GLMM models. Results Non-parametric bivariate statistics showed that there were more meningitis cases in urban health zones than in rural conditions (chi(2)= 6.910,p-value = 0.009), in areas dominated by savannah landscape than in areas with dense forest or forest in mountainous areas (chi(2)= 15.185,p-value = 0.001), and with no significant difference between climate types (chi(2)= 1.211,p-value = 0,449). Additionally, no significant difference was observed for attack rate between the two types of heath zones (chi(2)= 0.982,p-value = 0.322). Conversely, strong differences in attack rate values were obtained for vegetation types (chi(2)= 13.627,p-value = 0,001) and climate types (chi(2)= 13.627,p-value = 0,001). This work demonstrates that, all other parameters kept constant, an urban health zone located at high latitude and longitude eastwards, located at low-altitude like in valley ecosystems predominantly covered by savannah biome, with a humid tropical climate are at higher risk for the development of meningitis. In addition, the regions with mean range temperature and a population with a low index of economic well-being (IEW) constitute the perfect conditions for the development of meningitis in DRC. Conclusion In a context of global environmental change, particularly climate change, our findings tend to show that an interplay of different environmental and socio-economic drivers are important to consider in the epidemiology of bacterial meningitis epidemics in DRC. This information is important to help improving meningitis control strategies in a large country located outside of the so-called meningitis belt.
   Author summary Bacterial meningitis remains an international public health threat. The most affected area worldwide is the Sahelian region between Senegal and Ethiopia called the meningitis belt. In parallel recurrent epidemics have also occurred out of the belt in Africa for the last twenty years. While environmental, socioeconomic and demographic factors are well described to explain the epidemiology of meningitis in the belt, very few studies have focused on the role of these factors to understand meningitis epidemics outside of the belt. Based on epidemiological, socio-economic, demographic and environmental data collected for the period 2000-2018 in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), we used different statistical methods to explore the links between meningitis cases and the different explored factors. Our results showed that urbanized areas where populations have a low economic index of well-being, high latitude and longitude eastwards, medium to low altitude level, savannah-type vegetation, medium temperature value, are risk factors of meningitis outbreaks from North to South in the DRC. This information is important to help improving meningitis control strategies in a large country located outside the so-called meningitis belt.

TI  - Multi-Gene Detection and Identification of Mosquito-Borne RNA Viruses Using an Oligonucleotide Microarray
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background: Arthropod-borne viruses are important emerging pathogens world-wide. Viruses transmitted by mosquitoes, such as dengue, yellow fever, and Japanese encephalitis viruses, infect hundreds of millions of people and animals each year. Global surveillance of these viruses in mosquito vectors using molecular based assays is critical for prevention and control of the associated diseases. Here, we report an oligonucleotide DNA microarray design, termed ArboChip5.1, for multi-gene detection and identification of mosquito-borne RNA viruses from the genera Flavivirus (family Flaviviridae), Alphavirus (Togaviridae), Orthobunyavirus (Bunyaviridae), and Phlebovirus (Bunyaviridae).
   Methodology/Principal Findings: The assay utilizes targeted PCR amplification of three genes from each virus genus for electrochemical detection on a portable, field-tested microarray platform. Fifty-two viruses propagated in cell-culture were used to evaluate the specificity of the PCR primer sets and the ArboChip5.1 microarray capture probes. The microarray detected all of the tested viruses and differentiated between many closely related viruses such as members of the dengue, Japanese encephalitis, and Semliki Forest virus clades. Laboratory infected mosquitoes were used to simulate field samples and to determine the limits of detection. Additionally, we identified dengue virus type 3, Japanese encephalitis virus, Tembusu virus, Culex flavivirus, and a Quang Binh-like virus from mosquitoes collected in Thailand in 2011 and 2012.
   Conclusions/Significance: We demonstrated that the described assay can be utilized in a comprehensive field surveillance program by the broad-range amplification and specific identification of arboviruses from infected mosquitoes. Furthermore, the microarray platform can be deployed in the field and viral RNA extraction to data analysis can occur in as little as 12 h. The information derived from the ArboChip5.1 microarray can help to establish public health priorities, detect disease outbreaks, and evaluate control programs.

TI  - Ecology of sand flies in a low-density residential rural area, with mixed forest/agricultural exploitation, in north-eastern Brazil
T2  - ACTA TROPICA
AB  - Cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania braziliensis is endemic in Brazil, where Lutzomyia whitmani is the most important vector involved in the transmission to humans, particularly in the peridomestic environment. Herein, we assessed the ecology of sand flies, including Lu. whitmani, in a low-density residential rural area with mixed forest/agricultural exploitation in north-eastern Brazil, where cutaneous leishmaniasis is endemic. Particularly, we hypothesized that sand fly abundance was correlated with climatic variables. Sand fly collections were carried out monthly from August 2013 to August 2014, using seven CDC light traps, for three consecutive nights, in three kinds of environments: indoor, peridomicile and forest. Collected sand flies were identified based on morphology and females of Lu. whitmani (n = 169), Lu. amazonensis (n = 134) and Lu. complexa (n = 21) were selected and tested by PCR for Leishmania (Viannia) spp. In total, 5167 sand flies belonging to 19 species were identified, being that Lu. choti (43.2%) was the most frequent species, followed by Lu. amazonensis (16.6%), Lu. whitmani (15.8%), Lu. sordellii (10.7%) and Lu. quinquefer (5.8%), which together represented over 90% of the collected sand flies. All females tested by PCR were negative. The number of sand flies collected daily was positively correlated with temperature and negatively correlated with rainfall and relative humidity. Furthermore, there was a positive correlation between daily number of sand flies and daily average saturation deficit. This study points out that the number of sand flies captured daily is correlated to climatic variables, including saturation deficit, which may represent a useful parameter for monitoring sand fly populations in leishmaniasis-endemic areas.

TI  - Mapping Maize Fields by Using Multi-Temporal Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-2A Images in Makarfi, Northern Nigeria, Africa
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - A timely and accurate crop type mapping is very significant, and a prerequisite for agricultural regions and ensuring global food security. The combination of remotely sensed optical and radar datasets presents an opportunity for acquiring crop information at relative spatial resolution and temporal resolution adequately to capture the growth profiles of various crop species. In this paper, we employed Sentinel-1A (S-1) and Sentinel-2A (S-2) data acquired between the end of June and early September 2016, on a semi-arid area in northern Nigeria. A different set of (VV and VH) SAR and optical (SI and SB) images, illustrating crop phenological development stage, were employed as inputs to the two machines learning Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms to automatically map maize fields. Significant increases in overall classification were shown when the multi-temporal spectral indices (SI) and spectral band (SB) datasets were added with the different integration of SAR datasets (i.e., VV and VH). The best overall accuracy (OA) for maize (96.93%) was derived by using RF classification algorithms with SI-SB-SAR datasets, although the SI datasets for RF and SB datasets for SVM also produced high overall maize classification accuracies, of 97.04% and 97.44%. The outcomes indicate the robustness of the RF or SVM methods to produce high-resolution maps of maize for subsequent application from agronomists, policy planners, and the government, because such information is lacking in our study area.

TI  - Buruli ulcer (<i>Mycobacterium ulcerans</i> infection)
T2  - TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Mycobacterium ulcerans is an emerging infection that causes indolent, necrotizing skin lesions known as Buruli ulcer (BU). Bone lesions may include reactive osteitis or osteomyelitis beneath skin lesions, or metastatic osteomyelitis from lymphohematogenous spread of M. ulcerans. Pathogenesis is related to a necrotizing and immunosuppressive toxin produced by M. ulcerans, called mycolactone. The incidence of BU is highest in children up to 15 years old, and is a major public health problem in endemic countries due to disabling scarring and destruction of bone. Most patients live in West Africa, but the disease has been confirmed in at least 30 countries. Treatment options for BU are antibiotics and surgery. BCG vaccination provides short-term protection against M. ulcerans infection and prevents osteomyelitis. HIV infection may increase risk for BU, and renders BU highly aggressive. Unlike leprosy and tuberculosis, BU is related to environmental factors and is thus considered non-communicable. The most plausible mode of transmission is by skin trauma at sites contaminated by M. ulcerans. The reemergence of BU around 1980 may be attributable to environmental factors such as deforestation, artificial topographic alterations and increased manual agriculture of wetlands. The first cultivation of M. ulcerans from nature was reported in 2008. (c) Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.

TI  - Habitat use by Neotropical mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae): vegetation structure and edge effects
T2  - AUSTRAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - Knowing which habitats (e.g. forest interiors or edges) are used by mosquitos and their relationship with possible environmental changes can assist in the development of public policies for the prevention of mosquito-borne disease epidemics. This study assessed the influence of abiotic factors and vegetation structure on a mosquito community in an Atlantic rainforest remnant frequented by humans. Biting mosquito collections were undertaken by two operators and carried out every 2 weeks between October 2014 and October 2015, during the afternoon, at three points within the forest: A1 (40 m from the edge), A2 (220 m from the edge) and A3 (270 m from the edge). A significant difference was found between tree circumference at breast height from the different areas, as well as in tree height. However, no significant difference in the analysed abiotic factors between areas was observed. The paired comparison of mosquito abundance between the sample areas indicated that area A3 was different from area A1. Additionally, the abundance of the analysed species (Aedes crinifer,Aedes scapularis,Aedes serratus,Psorophora ferox,Sabethes aurescens,Sabethesidenticus,Trichoprosopon pallidiventerandWyeomyia limai) increased with distance from the forest edge. This observation may suggest that the abundance of certain species may be indicative of the level of disturbance of a forest.

TI  - Determinants of <i>Anopheles</i> Seasonal Distribution Patterns Across a Forest to Periurban Gradient near Iquitos, Peru
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - As part of a field ecology study of arbovirus and malaria activity in the Amazon Basin, Loreto Department, Peru, we collected mosquitoes landing on humans at a forest site and inside and outside of residences and military barracks at periurban, rural, and village sites. We collected 11 Anopheles spp. from these four sites. An. darlingi, the principal malaria vector in the region, accounted for 98.7% of all Anopheles spp. collected at Puerto Almendra. Peaks in landing activity occurred during the December and April collection periods. However, the percent of sporozoite-positive Anopheles spp. was highest 1-2 months later, when landing activity decreased to approximately 10% of the peak activity periods. At all sites, peak landing activity occurred about 2 hours after sunset. These data provide a better understanding of the taxonomy, population density, and seasonal and habitat distribution of potential malaria vectors within the Amazon Basin region.

TI  - Urban effects on native avifauna: a review
T2  - LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
AB  - The effect of urbanization can be immense, yet our understanding is rudimentary. Here, we compile the most recent information on urban impacts on avian populations and communities. Compared to other vertebrates, birds are easily monitored by skilled observers and provide a mechanism to explore urban effects and responses to different urban designs. Taxonomically, bird communities in distinctly different habitats are most different in the least disturbed sites and the most similar in the most urbanized sites. Urbanization tends to select for omnivorous, granivorous, and cavity nesting species. Increased urbanization typically leads to an increase in avian biomass but a reduction in richness. Unlike most passerines, raptors may have home ranges that extend beyond the urban boundary and therefore do not need to meet all their ecological requirements within urban areas. Urban habitats are often of superior quality to raptors because there they are often free from persecution and have an adequate food supply. The processes that underlie the patterns of population and community level responses need more attention, but several areas of have been identified as being important. Birds respond to vegetation composition and structure, and urban areas that retain native vegetative characteristics retain more native species than those that do not. Avian fecundity in urban areas is a reflection of species-specific adaptability to urban resources, and to levels of nest predation and nest parasitism. Additionally, non-consumptive human activities that increase with urbanization are recognized as having negative impacts on avian populations and communities. Avian survivorship in urban areas is influenced by risk of collision with man-made objects, changes in the predator assemblage, food supply, and disease. Missing are thorough investigations in the regions of highest human population growth, e.g. Southeast Asia. Additionally, there is a paucity of information from regions of high avian diversity, e.g. tropical forests. Clearly, local knowledge and study is required before implementation of management policies to reduce urban impacts on bird communities. Hopefully, such policies will include long-term monitoring. Demographic parameters of fecundity and survivorship need to be examined in conjunction with measures of community diversity and density across the urban gradient to better understand the quality of different urban habitats, and the variation of quality among spatial patterns of urbanization within the native habitat matrix.

TI  - Temporal dynamics of diversity in a tropical fruit fly (Tephritidae) ensemble and their implications on pest management and biodiversity conservation
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - The fact that pests are the most abundant species in agricultural settings has broadly precluded the attention to non-pest species and the study of temporal dynamics of diversity in agroecosystems. Because, agroecosystems hold increasingly important portions of biological diversity, understanding of non-pest species dynamics in such systems will contribute significantly to their conservation. In addition, deep understanding of both pest and non-pest population dynamics in a community context necessarily requires a long-term approach. By means of the analysis of weekly fruit fly sampling sessions across 12 years, in three tropical fruit orchards, we describe the temporal dynamics of species richness and turnover, structure and composition of Anastrepha fruit fly ensembles considering pest and non-pest species. Furthermore, we ask if time series of non-pest species covariate with time series of pest species, as a way to evaluate the best management scheme to minimize negative impacts of pest control on non-pest species. Among 18 Anastrepha fruit fly species detected over 12 years, five were considered as pest species. Fruit fly ensembles were characterized by strong seasonal dynamics composed of annual cycles. Sapodilla was the most diverse orchard. Overall, fruit fly ensembles appeared stable throughout time. The temporal dynamics of non-pest species covaried positively with temporal dynamics of pest abundance, with consequent management implications. Results suggest that in mango and grapefruit orchards, pest control could be focused during time periods with low potential impact on non-pest species; while in sapodilla orchards other approaches should be developed. The approach described here could be used in agroecosystems to minimize the impact of pest management on non-pest species particularly in highly anthropized landscapes and human-managed ecosystems were biodiversity conservation is a high priority.

TI  - Pan African phylogeography and palaeodistribution of rousettine fruit bats: Ecogeographic correlation with Pleistocene climate vegetation cycles
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY
AB  - Aim The impact of Pleistocene climatic oscillations on tropical biomes is associated with changes in the extent of forest cover. Fruit bats have played a role in woodland dynamics via pollination and seed dispersal. We hypothesized that phylogeographic patterns of Rousettus on continental Africa and adjacent islands should show a signature of pluvial-drought cycles, involving demographic expansions and contractions. Location Afrotropical, Malagasy and Saharo-Arabian biogeographic realms. Taxon Genus Rousettus (Pteropodidae). Methods Phylogeographic and population genetic approaches using mitochondrial and microsatellite data were integrated with species distribution modelling of currently suitable habitats and those of the Last Glacial Maximum using climate simulations. Results Phylogenetic reconstruction yielded an Asian outgroup followed by pectinate branching of the Indian Ocean taxa and Rousettus aegyptiacus. While nuclear microsatellites were homogeneous across the African mainland, two mitochondrial haplogroups were found. Haplogroup I is widespread in regions with extensive tree cover, including tropical rain forests, and has close relationships to isolated lineages in the Middle East and islands in the Gulf of Guinea. Haplogroup II is sister to the rest of the R. aegyptiacus radiation and is found in eastern and southern Africa and the Sudanian savanna in habitats with semi-open land cover. Main Conclusion Palaeodistributional modelling ascertained that the Indian Ocean islands provided more extensive areas of suitable habitat in the past relative to conditions today, suggesting stepping stone connectivity between Asia and Africa during Pleistocene interpluvial sea-level lowstands. Inverse pluvial-drought demography was detected in lineages ancestral to recent haplogroups, providing evidence of past forest refugia and complex ecogeographic scenarios of haplogroup origins involving allopatry and parapatry connected with the eastern Afromontane biodiversity hotspot, and subsequent admixture of nuclear gene pools. The Middle Eastern lineage probably originated during pluvial green Sahara periods, possibly in co-evolution with ancestors of tree crop species domesticated later during the Neolithic revolution. The keystone role of rousettine bats for forest regeneration and their ability to pioneer dry and distant habitats emphasize their role in conservation biology and restoration ecology.

TI  - Ecological Contexts of Index Cases and Spillover Events of Different Ebolaviruses
T2  - PLOS PATHOGENS
AB  - Ebola virus disease afflicts both human and animal populations and is caused by four ebola-viruses. These different ebolaviruses may have distinct reservoir hosts and ecological contexts that determine how, where, and when different ebolavirus spillover events occur. Understanding these virus-specific relationships is important for preventing transmission of ebolaviruses from wildlife to humans. We examine the ecological contexts surrounding 34 human index case infections of ebolaviruses from 1976-2014. Determining possible sources of spillover from wildlife, characterizing the environment of each event, and creating ecological niche models to estimate habitats suitable for spillover, we find that index case infections of two ebolaviruses, Ebola virus and Sudan virus, have occurred under different ecological contexts. The index cases of Ebola virus infection are more associated with tropical evergreen broadleaf forests and consuming bushmeat than the cases of Sudan virus. Given these differences, we emphasize caution when generalizing across different ebolaviruses and that location and virus-specific ecological knowledge will be essential to unravelling how human and animal behavior lead to the emergence of Ebola virus disease.

TI  - Bacterial infection of mudfish <i>Clarias gariepinus</i> (Siluriformes: Clariidae) fingerlings in tropical nursery ponds
T2  - REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL
AB  - Bacterial infection among the most common cultured mudfish Clarias gariepinus in Africa, has become a cause of concern, because it constitutes the largest economic loss in fish farms. In order to provide useful biological data of the pathogens for good management practices, samples were collected monthly between January 2008 and December 2009 in three monoculture nursery ponds, located in three different positions: upriver (A, grassland), mid-river (B, mixed forest and grassland) and downriver (C, rainforest) along 200km length of Cross River floodplains, Nigeria. A total of 720 fingerlings between 15.1 and 20.7g were analyzed to determine the degree of infection. The bacterial pathogens were taken from their external surfaces, and were isolated and identified by standard methods. The caudal fins of fingerlings from pond A had the highest bacterial load (5.8x10(3)cfu/g), while the least counts (1.2x103cfu/g) were identified on the head of fish from pond C, with Flexibacter columnaris as the major etiological agent. Pseudomonas fluorescens, Aeromonas hydrophila,Escherichia colt, Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus luteus were identified as co-isolates with P. fluorescens as dominant (0.7x10(2)cfu/mL) co-isolates in pond water. Clinical signs of five white spots with red periphery appeared on the external surface of infected fish. All the fish sampled, died after 4 to 9 days. There was no significant difference in the bacterial counts between different ponds, but the difference between fish organs/parts examined was significant. Fish from these ponds are therefore potentially dangerous to consumers and highly devalued, with the economic impact to producers. Preventive methods to avoid these infections are recommended. Rev. Biol. Trop. 59(2): 751-759. Epub 2011 June 01.

TI  - Skin microbiome profile of healthy Cameroonians and Japanese
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - The commensal microbes of the skin have a significant impact on dermal physiology and pathophysiology. Racial and geographical differences in the skin microbiome are suggested and may play a role in the sensitivity to dermatological disorders, including infectious diseases. However, little is known about the skin microbiome profiles of people living in Central Africa, where severe tropical infectious diseases impose a burden on the inhabitants. This study provided the skin profiles of healthy Cameroonians in different body sites and compared them to healthy Japanese participants. The skin microbiome of Cameroonians was distinguishable from that of Japanese in all skin sites examined in this study. For example, Micrococcus was predominantly found in skin samples of Cameroonians but mostly absent in Japanese skin samples. Instead, the relative abundance of Cutibacterium species was significantly higher in healthy Japanese. Principal coordinate analysis of beta diversity showed that the skin microbiome of Cameroonians formed different clusters from Japanese, suggesting a substantial difference in the microbiome profiles between participants of both countries. In addition, the alpha diversity in skin microbes was higher in Cameroonians than Japanese participants. These data may offer insights into the determinant factors responsible for the distinctness of the skin microbiome of people living in Central Africa and Asia.

TI  - Scaling patterns of human diseases and population size in Colombia
T2  - GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
AB  - Colombia has had one of the largest numbers of internally displaced populations in the world and in 2016 entered a period of post-conflict. These socio-ecological and geopolitical processes and trends have increased the migration of people towards cities and accordingly are affecting the distribution and occurrence of tropical diseases in its urban and peri-urban areas. Studies have suggested that anthropogenic phenomena such as ur-banization scale according to the size of human populations regardless of cultural context. But, other studies show that health epidemics such as malarial and human immunodeficiency virus infections, follow a scale-free distribution in terms of urban population size and density. Here, we explore these relationships and dynamics in a tropical context using statistical analyses and available geospatial data to identify the scale relationships be-tween urban growth processes and disease transmission in Colombia. Our results show that the dynamics of rural populations and certain diseases were characterized by power-laws that are indeed observed in urbanization studies. However, as opposed to these other studies, we found that malaria presented a higher intensity of infection in human settlements with less than 50,000 individuals and in particular for ethnic, indigenous pop-ulations. Results indicate that disease and urbanization relationships in Colombia do indeed follow scales; findings that differ from previous epidemiological studies such as those for malarial infection. Additionally, we identified trends showing that malarial infections become endemic in peri-urban areas. This approach using few, but robust and readily available, data is key for managing public health issues and understanding the spatial distribution of environmental impacts in the urbanizing tropics.

TI  - Serological investigation of protozoan pathogens (<i>Trypanosoma</i> <i>cruzi</i>, <i>Toxoplasma</i> <i>gondii</i> and <i>Neospora</i> <i>caninum</i>) in opossums from southern Brazil
T2  - VETERINARY PARASITOLOGY- REGIONAL STUDIES AND REPORTS
AB  - South American opossums of the order Didelphimorphia are considered sentinels for zoonotic infections and environmental diseases, such as for Chagas disease caused by Trypanosoma cruzi. Nevertheless, there is a paucity of data regarding protozoan diseases such Toxoplasma gondii and Neospora caninum in Neotropical marsupials; despite these pathogens have been considered threats to some marsupial species. The aim of this study was to determine whether Didelphis albiventris and Philander frenatus opossums from southern Brazil had been previously exposed to T. cruzi, T. gondii or N. caninum. Opossum samples were obtained by live-trapping of free-ranging animals and collection at wildlife rehabilitation centers in Rio Grande do Sul (RS) state, Brazil. The detection of anti-T. cruzi and anti-T. gondii antibodies was performed by indirect hemagglutination and anti-N. caninum antibodies by competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In total, samples were collected from 76 marsupials from nine municipalities in RS state, including 69 D. albiventris (white-eared opossum), and seven were P. frenatus (southern four-eyed opossum). For T. cruzi, 11% were seropositive, and for T. gondii 26% were seropositive. None of the marsupials sampled here were seropositive for N. caninum. Risk factor analysis showed that free-living animals were about five-fold more likely to be infected by T. gondii than were rescued animals. Our study showed the exposure of Neotropical marsupials (D. albiventris and P. frenatus) to protozoan pathogens T. cruzi and T. gondii, while no evidence of N. caninum exposure was found. The set of results presented here may have an effect on ecology and conservation of the studied species and may also indicate possible sentinels of these pathogen circulation.

TI  - Malaria vector species in Amazonian Peru co-occur in larval habitats but have distinct larval microbial communities
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - In Amazonian Peru, the primary malaria vector, Nyssorhynchus darlingi (formerly Anopheles darlingi), is difficult to target using standard vector control methods because it mainly feeds and rests outdoors. Larval source management could be a useful supplementary intervention, but to determine its feasibility, more detailed studies on the larval ecology of Ny. darlingi are essential. We conducted a multi-level study of the larval ecology of Anophelinae mosquitoes in the peri-Iquitos region of Amazonian Peru, examining the environmental characteristics of the larval habitats of four species, comparing the larval microbiota among species and habitats, and placing Ny. darlingi larval habitats in the context of spatial heterogeneity in human malaria transmission. We collected Ny. darlingi, Nyssorhynchus rangeli (formerly Anopheles rangeli), Nyssorhynchus triannulatus s.l. (formerly Anopheles triannulatus s.l.), and Nyssorhynchus sp. nr. konderi (formerly Anopheles sp. nr. konderi) from natural and artificial water bodies throughout the rainy and dry seasons. We found that, consistent with previous studies in this region and in Brazil, the presence of Ny. darlingi was significantly associated with water bodies in landscapes with more recent deforestation and lower light intensity. Nyssorhynchus darlingi presence was also significantly associated with a lower vegetation index, other Anophelinae species, and emergent vegetation. Though they were collected in the same water bodies, the microbial communities of Ny. darlingi larvae were distinct from those of Ny. rangeli and Ny. triannulatus s.l., providing evidence either for a species-specific larval microbiome or for segregation of these species in distinct microhabitats within each water body. We demonstrated that houses with more reported malaria cases were located closer to Ny. darlingi larval habitats; thus, targeted control of these sites could help ameliorate malaria risk. The co-occurrence of Ny. darlingi larvae in water bodies with other putative malaria vectors increases the potential impact of larval source management in this region.
   Author summary The standard methods used to combat mosquitoes that transmit malaria, long-lasting insecticide treated nets and indoor residual spraying, target mosquitoes that bite people indoors and rest indoors after biting. In Amazonian Peru, the major malaria vector, Nyssorhynchus darlingi (formerly Anopheles darlingi), is known to bite and rest mostly outdoors and to feed on animals as well as humans. Therefore, additional methods are needed to control this species, such as targeting immature mosquitoes in water bodies using chemical or biological larvicides or environmental modification. To determine whether this is feasible, more ecological information about Ny. darlingi larval habitats in this region is needed. In this study, we found that Ny. darlingi were more likely to be collected from water bodies in more deforested areas, and in the presence of other species of mosquitoes that transmit malaria. We characterized the bacteria detected in three species of mosquito larvae, and found that the species of mosquito, and not the water body, determined which bacteria were identified. As we found that houses with more malaria cases were located closer to Ny. darlingi larval habitats, management of larval habitats may be an effective method to reduce the risk of malaria in this region.

TI  - Case Report: Human Monkeypox in the Kivus, a Conflict Region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Monkeypox (MPX) is a zoonotic Orthopoxvirus infection endemic in central and western Africa. Human MPX cases occur in the central and northern regions of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), and this is the first report of confirmed MPX cases in the forested areas of North and South Kivu Provinces, with a detailed epidemiological investigation for one case. The location of each case is within areas predicted to be suitable for MPX virus transmission based on an ecological niche model. Phylogenetic analysis places these viruses in the Congo Basin clade.

TI  - Larval habitat characterization of <i>Anopheles darlingi</i> from its northernmost geographical distribution in Chiapas, Mexico
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
AB  - Background: Anopheles darlingi is considered the most efficient malaria vector in the Neotropical region. In Mexico, its role as an incriminated vector of Plasmodium has not been confirmed in the Lacandon forest. Similarly, knowledge about bionomic and larval ecology is scarce. The study aim was to identify and describe the larval habitats of An. darlingi in Chiapas, Mexico.
   Methods: Standard larval collections were performed in the Lacandon forest region and in the Soconusco region of southern Chiapas from January 2010 to April 2014, including dry and rainy seasons. Mean larval density of An. darlingi was estimated according to hydrological types, and associations between the presence of An. darlingi and environmental factors including ecological parameters and geographic positions were statistically analysed.
   Results: One hundred and twelve aquatic habitats were analysed, 80 from the Lacandon forest region and 32 from the Soconusco region; 94.64 % of these sites presented anopheline larvae. In total, 10,977 larvae belonging to 11 Anopheles species were collected. The 19 (out of 112) larval habitats positive to An. darlingi were: rain puddles (26.32 %), ground pools (21.05 %), ponds (15.79 %), ditches (15.79 %), river margins (10.53 %) and streams (10.53 %). Overall, the average (+/- SD) larval density was 6.60 +/- 2.41 larvae per dip. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that temporary habitats, green algae presence and stagnant water were associated with An. darlingi larval presence. The positive habitats were found in the Lacandon forest region during the rainy season (May-September). No specimens were found in the Soconusco region of the coastal plain of Chiapas.
   Conclusion: The mosquito An. darlingi larval habitats were found in different hydrological types. The habitat stability, presence of algae and water current were the main factors for An. darlingi larval occurrence. The information on the characteristics of the larval habitats of An. darlingi will be useful in sustainable programmes for malaria control in the Lacandon forest region, Chiapas.

TI  - Habitat segregation of dengue vectors along an urban environmental gradient
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Differential distributions of Aedes aegypti and Ae. mediovittatus (potential inter-epidemic dengue vector) and other mosquitoes colonizing bamboo pots in San Juan, Puerto Rico were studied along an urban-rural gradient. City regions (urban, suburban, and rural) and landscape elements within regions (forest [F], low-density housing [LDH], and high-density housing [HDH]) were identified using satellite imagery. Aedes species extensively overlapped in LDH of urban, suburban, and rural areas. Mosquito species showed their high specificity for landscape elements (96.6% correct classification by discriminant analysis); absence of Ae. mediovittatus in HDH or absence of Ae. aegypti in forests were the main indicator variables. The gradient was explained using a canonical correspondence analysis, which showed the association of Ae. aegypti with HDH in urban areas, Culex quinquefusciatus with LDH in suburbs, and Ae. mediovittatus and other native mosquitoes (Cx. antillummagnorum, Toxorhynchites portoricencis) with less disturbed habitats (forests, LDH).

TI  - Ecohealth research in Africa: Where from-Where to?
T2  - ACTA TROPICA
AB  - Epidemiological mapping and risk profiling build on the idea that diseases are tied to social-ecological systems that govern the distribution and abundance of transmissible pathogens, vectors and hosts. This is the heart of the emerging field of ecohealth, which examines how biological, cultural, demographic, economic, physical, political and social environments change and how these changes affect the health and wellbeing of humans, animals and ecosystems and the services they provide. This paper is an overview of a special issue of Acta Tropica, whose 15 publications reflect a geographically and epidemiologically diverse landscape of ecohealth. Nowhere is an ecohealth approach better suited than in Africa and its myriad of landscapes that include contexts varying from profuse expanses of tropical rain forests to the world's greatest desert. The publication of African ecohealth-related projects displays a biological, cultural and social diversity in health system contexts and a wide variety of contributions pertaining to different, often neglected, tropical diseases, including brucellosis, Buruli ulcer, fascioliasis, malaria, Q fever, rabies, Rift Valley fever and schistosomiasis. Pursuing an ecohealth approach provides a platform that brings together community members, decision makers, scientists and other stakeholders with a view to understand how ecosystem changes affect health conditions. Taken together, the presentation of this variety of papers dealing with environmental variables associated with health inaugurates the vital concept of ecohealth. By emphasizing that all organisms are part of social-ecological systems, the long-term wellbeing of both people and animals depending on healthy and productive ecosystems is highlighted.

TI  - Presence and Persistence of Ebola or Marburg Virus in Patients and Survivors: A Rapid Systematic Review
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   The 2013-15 Ebola outbreak was unprecedented due to sustained transmission within urban environments and thousands of survivors. In 2014 the World Health Organization stated that there was insufficient evidence to give definitive guidance about which body fluids are infectious and when they pose a risk to humans. We report a rapid systematic review of published evidence on the presence of filoviruses in body fluids of infected people and survivors.
   Methods
   Scientific articles were screened for information about filovirus in human body fluids. The aim was to find primary data that suggested high likelihood of actively infectious filovirus in human body fluids (viral RNA). Eligible infections were from Marburg virus (MARV or RAVV) and Zaire, Sudan, Tai Forest and Bundibugyo species of Ebola. Cause of infection had to be laboratory confirmed (in practice either tissue culture or RT-PCR tests), or evidenced by compatible clinical history with subsequent positivity for filovirus antibodies or inflammatory factors. Data were extracted and summarized narratively.
   Results
   6831 unique articles were found, and after screening, 33 studies were eligible. For most body fluid types there were insufficient patients to draw strong conclusions, and prevalence of positivity was highly variable. Body fluids taken > 16 days after onset were usually negative. In the six studies that used both assay methods RT-PCR tests for filovirus RNA gave positive results about 4 times more often than tissue culture.
   Conclusions
   Filovirus was reported in most types of body fluid, but not in every sample from every otherwise confirmed patient. Apart from semen, most non-blood, RT-PCR positive samples are likely to be culture negative and so possibly of low infectious risk. Nevertheless, it is not apparent how relatively infectious many body fluids are during or after illness, even when culture-positive, not least because most test results come from more severe cases. Contact with blood and blood-stained body fluids remains the major risk for disease transmission because of the known high viral loads in blood.

TI  - Why are fruits colorful? The relative importance of achromatic and chromatic contrasts for detection by birds
T2  - EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY
AB  - The colors of fruits and flowers are traditionally viewed as an adaptation to increase the detectability of plant organs to animal vectors. The detectability of visual signals increases with increasing contrasts between target and background. Contrasts consist of a chromatic aspect (color) and an achromatic aspect (light intensity), which are perceived separately by animals. To evaluate the relative importance of fruits' chromatic and achromatic contrasts for the detection by avian fruit consumers we conducted an experiment with artificial fruits of four different colors in a tropical forest. We displayed the fruits against two different backgrounds, an artificial background and a natural one, because they differed in achromatic properties. We found no effect of the type of background on fruit detection rates. Detection rates differed for the four fruit colors. The probability of detection was explained by the chromatic contrast between fruits and their background, not by the achromatic contrasts. We suggest that birds attend primarily to chromatic contrast probably because these are more reliably detected under variable light conditions. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found habitat-specific differences in the conspicuousness of natural fruit colors in the study area. Fruits of understory species that are subjected to the variable light conditions within a forest displayed higher chromatic contrasts than species growing in the open restinga forest with constant bright illumination. There was no such difference for achromatic contrasts. In sum, we suggest that fruit colors differ between habitats because fruit colors that have strong chromatic contrasts against background can increase plants' reproductive success, particularly under variable light conditions.

TI  - Predation of mosquitos by odonates in a tropical urban environment: insights from functional response and field mesocosm experiments
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONTROL
AB  - Mosquito borne diseases (e.g., dengue fever, Zika fever, chikungunya fever) are a recurring problem worldwide. Using the natural predators of mosquitoes, such as odonates (dragonflies and damselflies), provides an alternative, more sustainable approach towards vector control. We assessed the biological control potential of the larvae of three common urban odonates (Crocothemis servilia, Ischnura senegalensis, Orthetrum sabina) using laboratory-based functional response and field-based mesocosm experiments. Functional response experiments using fourth instar Aedes albopictus mosquito larvae as prey revealed Type II functional responses in all three odonate species, highlighting their predatory efficiencies at low prey densities and demonstrating that urban odonates can consume substantial numbers of mosquito larvae (up to 44 per day) under experimental conditions. Complementary field-based experiments, however, showed little impact of odonate larvae predation on the overall composition of naturally colonizing aquatic macroinvertebrate communities, but revealed substantial size-selective predation by odonate larvae on mosquito larvae. Our results provide the first assessment of the predation efficiencies of urban odonate larvae, and highlight their potential as biological control agents of mosquitoes and other aquatic insect pests in highly modified urban landscapes.

TI  - Epidemiologic Features and Environmental Risk Factors of Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome, Xinyang, China
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background: Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging infectious disease discovered in rural areas of Central China in 2009, caused by a novel bunyavirus, SFTS virus (SFTSV). The disease usually presents as fever, thrombocytopenia, and leukocytopenia, with case-fatality rates ranging from 2.5% to 30%. Haemaphysalis longicornis was suspected to be the most likely vector of SFTSV. By the end of 2012, the disease had expanded to 13 provinces of China. SFTS patients have been reported in Japan and South Korea, and a disease similar to SFTS has been reported in the United States.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We characterized the epidemiologic features of 504 confirmed SFTS cases in Xinyang Region, the most severely SFTS-afflicted region in China from 2011 to 2012, and assessed the environmental risk factors. All cases occurred during March to November, with the epidemic peaking from May to July. The patients' ages ranged from 7 to 87 years (median 61 years), and the annual incidence increased with age (chi(2) test for trend, P<0.001). The female-to-male ratio of cases was 1.58, and 97.0% of the cases were farmers who resided in the southern and western parts of the region. The Poisson regression analysis revealed that the spatial variations of SFTS incidence were significantly associated with the shrub, forest, and rain-fed cropland areas.
   Conclusions: The distribution of SFTS showed highly significant temporal and spatial heterogeneity in Xinyang Region, with the majority of SFTS cases being elderly farmers who resided in the southern and western parts of the region, mostly acquiring infection between May and July when H. longicornis is highly active. The shrub, rain-fed, and rain-fed cropland areas were associated with high risk for this disease.

TI  - Detection of New Zealand Kauri Trees with AISA Aerial Hyperspectral Data for Use in Multispectral Monitoring
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - The endemic New Zealand kauri trees (Agathis australis) are of major importance for the forests in the northern part of New Zealand. The mapping of kauri locations is required for the monitoring of the deadly kauri dieback disease (Phytophthora agathidicida (PTA)). In this study, we developed a method to identify kauri trees by optical remote sensing that can be applied in an area-wide campaign. Dead and dying trees were separated in one class and the remaining trees with no to medium stress symptoms were defined in the two classes "kauri" and "other". The reference dataset covers a representative selection of 3165 precisely located crowns of kauri and 21 other canopy species in the Waitakere Ranges west of Auckland. The analysis is based on an airborne hyperspectral AISA Fenix image (437-2337 nm, 1 m(2) pixel resolution). The kauri spectra show characteristically steep reflectance and absorption features in the near-infrared (NIR) region with a distinct long descent at 1215 nm, which can be parameterised with a modified Normalised Water Index (mNDWI-Hyp). With a Jeffries-Matusita separability over 1.9, the kauri spectra can be well separated from 21 other canopy vegetation spectra. The Random Forest classifier performed slightly better than Support Vector Machine. A combination of the mNDWI-Hyp index with four additional spectral indices with three red to NIR bands resulted in an overall pixel-based accuracy (OA) of 91.7% for crowns larger 3 m diameter. While the user's and producer's accuracies for the class "kauri" with 94.6% and 94.8% are suitable for management purposes, the separation of "dead/dying trees" from "other" canopy vegetation poses the main challenge. The OA can be improved to 93.8% by combining "kauri" and "dead/dying" trees in one class, separate classifications for low and high forest stands and a binning to 10 nm bandwidths. Additional wavelengths and their respective indices only improved the OA up to 0.6%. The method developed in this study allows an accurate location of kauri trees for an area-wide mapping with a five-band multispectral sensor in a representative selection of forest ecosystems.

TI  - Epidemiology and Molecular Characterization of <i>Cryptosporidium</i> spp. in Humans, Wild Primates, and Domesticated Animals in the Greater Gombe Ecosystem, Tanzania
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Cryptosporidium is an important zoonotic parasite globally. Few studies have examined the ecology and epidemiology of this pathogen in rural tropical systems characterized by high rates of overlap among humans, domesticated animals, and wildlife. We investigated risk factors for Cryptosporidium infection and assessed cross-species transmission potential among people, non-human primates, and domestic animals in the Gombe Ecosystem, Kigoma District, Tanzania. A cross-sectional survey was designed to determine the occurrence and risk factors for Cryptosporidium infection in humans, domestic animals and wildlife living in and around Gombe National Park. Diagnostic PCR revealed Cryptosporidium infection rates of 4.3% in humans, 16.0% in non-human primates, and 9.6% in livestock. Local streams sampled were negative. DNA sequencing uncovered a complex epidemiology for Cryptosporidium in this system, with humans, baboons and a subset of chimpanzees infected with C. hominis subtype IfA12G2; another subset of chimpanzees infected with C. suis; and all positive goats and sheep infected with C. xiaoi. For humans, residence location was associated with increased risk of infection in Mwamgongo village compared to one camp ( Kasekela), and there was an increased odds for infection when living in a household with another positive person. Fecal consistency and other gastrointestinal signs did not predict Cryptosporidium infection. Despite a high degree of habitat overlap between village people and livestock, our results suggest that there are distinct Cryptosporidium transmission dynamics for humans and livestock in this system. The dominance of C. hominis subtype IfA12G2 among humans and non-human primates suggest cross-species transmission. Interestingly, a subset of chimpanzees was infected with C. suis. We hypothesize that there is cross-species transmission from bush pigs (Potaochoerus larvatus) to chimpanzees in Gombe forest, since domesticated pigs are regionally absent. Our findings demonstrate a complex nature of Cryptosporidium in sympatric primates, including humans, and stress the need for further studies.

TI  - Spatial variations in Leishmaniasis: A biogeographic approach to mapping the distribution of <i>Leishmania</i> species
T2  - ONE HEALTH
AB  - Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (CL) is the most prevalent form of Leishmaniasis and is widely endemic in the Americas. Several species of Leishmania are responsible for CL, a severely neglected tropical disease and the treatment of CL vary according to the different species of Leishmania. We proposed to map the distribution of the Leishmania species reported in French Guiana (FG) using a biogeographic approach based on environmental predictors. We also measured species endemism i.e., the uniqueness of species to a defined geographic location. Our results show that the distribution patterns varied between Leishmania spp. and were spatially dependent on climatic covariates. The species distribution modelling of the eco-epidemiological spatial patterns of Leishmania spp. is the first to measure endemism based on bioclimatic factors in FG. The study also emphasizes the impact of tree cover loss and climate on the increasing distribution of L. (Viannia) braziliensis in the most anthropized regions. Detection of high-risk regions for the different between Leishmania spp. is essential for monitoring and active surveillance of the vector. As climate plays a major role in the spatial distribution of the vector and reservoir and the survival of the pathogen, climatic covariates should be included in the analysis and mapping of vector-borne diseases. This study underscores the significance of local land management and the urgency of considering the impact of climate change in the development of vector-borne disease management strategies at the global scale.

TI  - The impact of industrial activities on vector-borne disease transmission
T2  - ACTA TROPICA
AB  - Industrial activities have produced profound changes in the natural environment, including the mass removal of trees, fragmentation of habitats, and creation of larval mosquito breeding sites, that have allowed the vectors of disease pathogens to thrive. We conducted a review of the literature to assess the impact of industrial activities on vector-borne disease transmission. Our study shows that industrial activities may be coupled with significant changes to human demographics that can potentially increase contact between pathogens, vectors and hosts, and produce a shift of parasites and susceptible populations between low and high disease endemic areas. Indeed, where vector-borne diseases and industrial activities intersect, large numbers of potentially immunologically naive people may be exposed to infection and lack the knowledge and means to protect themselves from infection. Such areas are typically associated with inadequate access to quality health care, thus allowing industrial development and production sites to become important foci of transmission. The altered local vector ecologies, and the changes in disease dynamics that changes affect, create challenges for under-resourced health care and vector-control systems.

TI  - Modelling the Effects of Mass Drug Administration on the Molecular Epidemiology of Schistosomes
T2  - MATHEMATICAL MODELS FOR NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES: ESSENTIAL TOOLS FOR CONTROL AND ELIMINATION, PT A
AB  - As national governments scale up mass drug administration (MDA) programs aimed to combat neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), novel selection pressures on these parasites increase. To understand how parasite populations are affected by MDA and how to maximize the success of control programmes, it is imperative for epidemiological, molecular and mathematical modelling approaches to be combined. Modelling of parasite population genetic and genomic structure, particularly of the NTDs, has been limited through the availability of only a few molecular markers to date. The landscape of infectious disease research is being dramatically reshaped by next-generation sequencing technologies and our understanding of how repeated selective pressures are shaping parasite populations is radically altering. Genomics can provide high-resolution data on parasite population structure, and identify how loci may contribute to key phenotypes such as virulence and/or drug resistance. We discuss the incorporation of genetic and genomic data, focussing on the recently sequenced Schistosoma spp., into novel mathematical transmission models to inform our understanding of the impact of MDA and other control methods. We summarize what is known to date, the models that exist and how population genetics has given us an understanding of the effects of MDA on the parasites. We consider how genetic and genomic data have the potential to shape future research, highlighting key areas where data are lacking, and how future molecular epidemiology knowledge can aid understanding of transmission dynamics and the effects of MDA, ultimately informing public health policy makers of the best interventions for NTDs.

TI  - Reflections on clinical research in sub-Saharan Africa
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY
AB  - The urgent need for new, safe and sustainable interventions against diseases that disproportionally affect the poor is finally receiving global attention and the funding landscape for development projects has significantly improved during the past decade. For the development of new drug and vaccine candidates, clinical trials have become the most important tool to assess their safety and efficacy. Recently, there has been a seismic shift in the number of clinical trials conducted in resource-limited settings. We discuss the current framework of clinical research in sub-Saharan Africa, from building product pipelines to the capacities needed for the conduct of trials according the harmonised Good Clinical Practice (GCP) ICH E6 guideline. We place emphasis on clinical research in neglected tropical diseases which still frequently has to be conducted with limited financial, logistical and human resources. Given those short-comings we recommend minimum standards needed at the local, national and sponsor levels to provide GCP-compliant clinical research. (C) 2009 Australian Society for Parasitology Inc.

TI  - Reproductive performance of northern Australia beef herds. 6. Risk factors associated with reproductive losses between confirmed pregnancy and weaning
T2  - ANIMAL PRODUCTION SCIENCE
AB  - Context. High and variable fetal and calf loss in beef herds occurs across northern Australia. Reasons for the majority of these losses, a major cost to the industry, have remained unknown.
   Aims. The research question was, which of the 58 region-, property-, management group-, and animal-level risk factors measured are associated with pregnant females failing to wean their calf?
   Methods. An epidemiological study measured fetal and calf loss (consistently expressed as % points) between confirmed pregnancy and weaning and the major associated risk factors using a selected population from 55 commercial beef breeding herds representing 23 166 pregnancies in the mostly dry tropical environment of northern Australia.
   Key results. Median fetal and calf loss was 9.5% with large variation. Achievable levels appeared to be <10% for Northern Forest herds, and <5% for Southern Forest, Central Forest and Northern Downs herds. The risk factors most strongly associated with fetal and calf loss were low-fertility country type interacting with phosphorus inadequacy (up to 10% increase), low body condition score interacting with phosphorus inadequacy (up to 8% increase), tall cows (up to 4% increase), and high temperature-humidity index around calving interacting with country type (up to 7% increase). These are nutritional and environmental risk factors and had the combined highest individual effect and frequency. Other risk factors associated with fetal and calf loss included first-lactation cows, which interacted with mustering around calving (up to 9% increase), having not reared a calf in the previous year interacting with cow age (up to 8% increase), low mustering efficiency (up to 9% increase), perceived predation by wild dogs (4-5% increase), high prevalence of Campylobacter fetus sp. venerealis antibodies (7% increase), recent infection with bovine viral diarrhoea virus (9% increase), and inadequate dry-season protein (4% increase).
   Conclusions. The combined effects of environmental, nutritional and management risk factors on fetal and calf loss in northern Australia were large and additive and were much greater, collectively up to 30-40%, and more consistent than that due to either endemic infectious diseases or animal factors.
   Implications. Opportunity for remedial action is high and, for the effect of non-infectious risk factors, should target milk delivery to neonatal calves.

TI  - Technical Workflow Development for Integrating Drone Surveys and Entomological Sampling to Characterise Aquatic Larval Habitats of <i>Anopheles funestus</i> in Agricultural Landscapes in Cote d'Ivoire
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Land-use practices such as agriculture can impact mosquito vector breeding ecology, resulting in changes in disease transmission. The typical breeding habitats of Africa's second most important malaria vector Anopheles funestus are large, semipermanent water bodies, which make them potential candidates for targeted larval source management. This is a technical workflow for the integration of drone surveys and mosquito larval sampling, designed for a case study aiming to characterise An. funestus breeding sites near two villages in an agricultural setting in Cote d'Ivoire. Using satellite remote sensing data, we developed an environmentally and spatially representative sampling frame and conducted paired mosquito larvae and drone mapping surveys from June to August 2021. To categorise the drone imagery, we also developed a land cover classification scheme with classes relative to An. funestus breeding ecology. We sampled 189 potential breeding habitats, of which 119 (63%) were positive for the Anopheles genus and nine (4.8%) were positive for An. funestus. We mapped 30.42 km(2) of the region of interest including all water bodies which were sampled for larvae. These data can be used to inform targeted vector control efforts, although its generalisability over a large region is limited by the fine-scale nature of this study area. This paper develops protocols for integrating drone surveys and statistically rigorous entomological sampling, which can be adjusted to collect data on vector breeding habitats in other ecological contexts. Further research using data collected in this study can enable the development of deep-learning algorithms for identifying An. funestus breeding habitats across rural agricultural landscapes in Cote d'Ivoire and the analysis of risk factors for these sites.

TI  - Ultrastructural changes of cell morphology and viral morphogenesis of two ecotypes of dengue virus infection in human monocytic U-937 cell
T2  - TROPICAL BIOMEDICINE
AB  - Dengue virus (DENV) is maintained and circulated in both sylvatic/enzootic and endemic/human cycles and spill over infection of sylvatic DENV into human populations has been reported. Extensive deforestation and increase human activities in forest may increase the risk of human exposure to sylvatic dengue infection and this may become a threat to human. Present study investigated the changes in cell morphology and viral morphogenesis upon infection with sylvatic and endemic ecotypes in human monocytic U-937 cells using transmission electron microscopy. Autophagy, a process that is either pro-viral or anti-viral, was observed in U-937 cells of both infections, however only the replication of endemic DENV was evidenced. An insight into the infection responses of sylvatic progenitors of DENV in susceptible host cells may provide better understanding on dengue emergence in human populations.

TI  - MALARIA AND MOBILITY IN THAILAND
T2  - SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE
AB  - This paper examines the relationship between malaria transmission and migration in three northern Thai villages. Data and observations indicate that land-poor families forced into swidden farming have greater contact with the primary vectors in Thailand--which breed in small pools in forested areas and shady clearings on hilly scrub terrain. Once infected, migrants from an endemic locus can introduce the parasite into an area with no transmission but potent vectors, thus becoming the cause of explosive epidemics; equally, non-immunes carrying out agricultural activities in or across forest and border areas can themselves be subject to seasonal morbidity.
   In addition to agricultural activities on clearings near forested areas, clandestine forest activities and cross border traffic contributes to the high prevalence of malaria in Thai border villages. Illegal economic activities-logging, poaching, cattle and goods smuggling-interferes with vector suppression campaigns and prompt detection of infected cases, and ultimately increases human infection not only within the mobile population, but also within the passive population of villages to which the migrants return periodically.
   Control measures   therefore need to take into account the economic pressures which determine a high degree of mobility, the ethnic diversity of the groups which depend on fringe activities for their economic welfare, and the difficult geography of the areas in which they live. As long as economic circumstances forcing human-vector contact receives inadequate attention, better alternatives to current vector control campaigns (which are not effective amongst migrants) are not tried and malaria transmission continues.

TI  - What can myxomycetes tell us about floricolous microbial systems?
T2  - NOVA HEDWIGIA
AB  - The study described herein was conducted in Costa Rica in an effort to generate baseline data on the association between tropical inflorescences and a group of microorganisms known as myxomycetes. The assemblage structure of myxomycetes was tested in three canopy cover classes between two independent study areas subject to different management strategies. One study area was an isolated patch in a suburban location while the other was located in a protected area with extensive connectivity to several national parks. Twenty-four species were recorded with only small differences in species occurrence and diversity between the two study areas. However, differences in diversity estimators were found for assemblages among the canopy cover classes within each study area. Intermediate and open canopy cover classes were the most dissimilar for the complete investigation, with those in the area with high forest connectivity and lack of plant manipulation being the ones responsible for the majority of the differences. Differences in assemblage structure among canopy cover categories were associated with differences in pH values. This study found a strong connection between monocot plants and myxomycetes in tropical environments and provides additional evidence for the existence of a guild of floricolous myxomycetes. The results suggest that vector-driven colonization of inflorescences by myxomycetes may be partially responsible for their occurrence in this microhabitat, but additional studies are required. Our study showed a resilient system of interaction that would naturally occur in different environmental conditions, suggesting a strong and stable relationship.

TI  - Microgeographical structure in the major Neotropical malaria vector <i>Anopheles darlingi</i> using microsatellites and SNP markers
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
AB  - Background: In recent decades, throughout the Amazon Basin, landscape modification contributing to profound ecological change has proceeded at an unprecedented rate. Deforestation that accompanies human activities can significantly change aspects of anopheline biology, though this may be site-specific. Such local changes in anopheline biology could have a great impact on malaria transmission. The aim of this study was to investigate population genetics of the main malaria vector in Brazil, Anopheles darlingi, from a microgeographical perspective.
   Methods: Microsatellites and ddRADseq-derived single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs) were used to assess levels of population genetic structuring among mosquito populations from two ecologically distinctive agricultural settlements (similar to 60 km apart) and a population from a distant (similar to 700 km) urban setting in the western Amazon region of Brazil.
   Results: Significant microgeographical population differentiation was observed among Anopheles darlingi populations via both model-and non-model-based analysis only with the SNP dataset. Microsatellites detected moderate differentiation at the greatest distances, but were unable to differentiate populations from the two agricultural settlements. Both markers showed low polymorphism levels in the most human impacted sites.
   Conclusions: At a microgeographical scale, signatures of genetic heterogeneity and population divergence were evident in Anopheles darlingi, possibly related to local environmental anthropic modification. This divergence was observed only when using high coverage SNP markers.

TI  - An Integrated Approach to Identify New Anti-Filarial Leads to Treat River Blindness, a Neglected Tropical Disease
T2  - PATHOGENS
AB  - Filarial worms cause multiple debilitating diseases in millions of people worldwide, including river blindness. Currently available drugs reduce transmission by killing larvae (microfilariae), but there are no effective cures targeting the adult parasites (macrofilaricides) which survive and reproduce in the host for very long periods. To identify effective macrofilaricides, we carried out phenotypic screening of a library of 2121 approved drugs for clinical use against adult Brugia pahangi and prioritized the hits for further studies by integrating those results with a computational prioritization of drugs and associated targets. This resulted in the identification of 18 hits with anti-macrofilaricidal activity, of which two classes, azoles and aspartic protease inhibitors, were further expanded upon. Follow up screening against Onchocerca spp. (adult Onchocerca ochengi and pre-adult O. volvulus) confirmed activity for 13 drugs (the majority having IC50 < 10 mu M), and a counter screen of a subset against L. loa microfilariae showed the potential to identify selective drugs that prevent adverse events when co-infected individuals are treated. Stage specific activity was also observed. Many of these drugs are amenable to structural optimization, and also have known canonical targets, making them promising candidates for further optimization that can lead to identifying and characterizing novel anti-macrofilarial drugs.

TI  - Ethnobotanical survey of medicinal plant species used by communities around Mabira and Mpanga Central Forest Reserves, Uganda
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HEALTH
AB  - Background Medicinal plants form an integral part of many health care systems in Uganda. This study aimed at documenting the therapeutic importance of plant species used in primary health care among communities living adjacent to Mabira and Mpanga forest reserves in Central Uganda. Methods An ethnobotanical study was conducted between April and June 2018 in 7 villages adjacent to Mpanga and 6 villages adjacent to Mabira central forest reserves. Information was obtained from 28 respondents identified using snowball and purposive sampling techniques and interviewed using semi-structured questionnaires. Descriptive statistics were used to present the data. The quantitative analysis of data was done using fidelity level, informant consensus factor, and percent respondent knowledge indices. Results A total of 136 medicinal plants were recorded. The plant species classified into 55 families were grouped under 14 medical categories with the highest number of plant species being used for digestive disorders (44%), followed by respiratory (38%) and dermatological disorders (36%). Hoslundia opposita Vahl was mentioned by 71% of the respondents for treating 22 disease conditions. Plant Family Fabaceae was the most represented with 16 species. Informant consensus agreement was high (0.7) for respiratory disorders. The fidelity level was 100% for Bidens pilosa L. and Callistemon citrinus Skeels for treating wounds and cough, respectively. Plant remedies were mainly prepared by decoction (31%) and administered orally (36%). A large number of plants (61%) were harvested from wild habitats. Herbs (50%) and leaves (50%) contributed the highest percentage of plant biological forms and parts used in remedy preparation. Conclusion This study recorded plant species with the potential to treat a wide range of illnesses. This is reflected in the high diversity of the recorded species used for medicinal purposes. Pharmacological studies on the plants with high percentage use values and fidelity levels are needed to validate their uses in the management of the said therapeutic applications. Further research on the isolation and characterization of the plant active compounds could lead to the discovery of new potential drugs.

TI  - Tansley Review No. 104 - Calcium physiology and terrestrial ecosystem processes
T2  - NEW PHYTOLOGIST
AB  - Calcium occupies a unique position among plant nutrients both chemically and functionally. Its chemical properties allow it to exist in a wide range of binding states and to serve in both structural and messenger roles. Despite its importance in many plant processes, Ca mobility is low, making Ca uptake and distribution rate a limiting process for many key plant functions. Ca plays an essential role in regulating many physiological processes that influence both growth and responses to environmental stresses. Included among these are: water and solute movement, influenced through effects on membrane structure and stomatal function; cell division and cell wall synthesis; direct or signaling roles in systems involved in plant defense and repair of damage from biotic and abiotic stress; rates of respiratory metabolism and translocation; and structural chemistry and function of woody support tissues. Forest trees, because of their size and age capacity, have been examined for evidence of limitations imposed by the timing and level of Ca supply. Examination of Ca physiology and biogeochemical cycling for forested systems reveals many indications that Ca supply places important limitations on forest structure and function. These limitations are likely to be most significant with older trees, later successional stages, high levels of soil acidity and/or high canopy Ca leaching losses, or under conditions vc here plant competition is high or transpiration is limited by high humidity or low soil moisture. Evidence of structural and physiological adaptations of forests to limited Ca supply; indicators of system dysfunction at many levels under reduced Ca supply; and the positive responses of diverse indicators of forest vitality in liming experiments indicate that Ca is more important to forest function and structure than has generally been recognized. Lack of recognition of Ca limitations is due in part to that fact some important plant functions are controlled by changes in very small physiologically active pools within the cytoplasm, and whole-leaf Ca levels may not reflect these limitations. An additional aspect is the fact that Ca availability has declined significantly for man!, forests in just the past few decades. Additional research on the role of Ca supply in resistance of forests to disease, changes in structural integrity of woody tissues, restrictions on rooting patterns and function, and uptake of other nutrients, notably N, is needed. Increased understanding of the physiological ecology of Ca supply can be anticipated to provide important insights that will aid in future protection and management of both natural and commercial forest systems.

TI  - COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF MOSQUITO TRAP COUNTS IN THE PERUVIAN AMAZON: EFFECT OF TRAP TYPE AND OTHER COVARIATES ON COUNTS AND DIVERSITY
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MOSQUITO CONTROL ASSOCIATION
AB  - Efficient detection of multiple species of adult mosquitoes in various habitats using effective traps is a crucial 1st step in any disease prevention program. Novel trap types that target tropical vectors of human diseases require field testing in the habitat of the vector-disease system in question. This paper analyzes a series of mosquito trapping studies conducted at Mapacocha, San Juan Bautista District, Loreto, Peru, during August- September 2013 and April-May 2014. Six trap configurations were evaluated in forest and rural locations. Adult mosquito counts were analyzed using full Bayesian inference of multilevel generalized linear models and posterior probability point estimates of the difference of means of the combined trap catch by trap type comparisons of all species. Light traps (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] incandescent, white light-emitting diode [LED], and ultraviolet LED). caught greater numbers of mosquitoes compared with traps baited with yeast-generated CO2 and Biogents Sentinel (TM) traps (battery powered traps without light and passive box traps). However, diversity measures (species richness, evenness, and similarity) were consistently nearly equal among trap types. Arbovirus vectors were more common in forest locations, while malaria vectors were more common near human habitations. Location had a significant effect on trap effectiveness and mosquito diversity, with traps from forest locations having greater numbers and greater species richness, compared with traps set near human habitations. The results of this study will inform mosquito surveillance trap choices in remote regions of central South America, including regions with emerging tropical diseases, such and dengue and Zika virus.

TI  - Mosquitoes and Mosquito-Borne Diseases in Vietnam
T2  - INSECTS
AB  - Simple Summary Vietnam is one of the tropical countries of Asia where individuals are at high risk of attaining mosquito-borne diseases. Due to rapid urbanization in Vietnam, most of the major cities have immense population growth, along with inadequate control measures over mosquitoes. These factors contributed to a sudden increase in the population of disease vectors that lead to cyclical epidemics of mosquito-borne diseases. This review paper aims to (i) provide a complete checklist of Vietnamese mosquitoes, (ii) provide an overview of mosquito-borne diseases in Vietnam, and (iii) preventive measures for mosquitoes in Vietnam. We list 281 mosquito species, belonging to 42 subgenera of 22 genera. We found that three genera, namely, Anopheles, Aedes, and Culex are found to be potential vectors for mosquito-borne diseases in Vietnam. We found dengue and malaria are the most common mosquito-borne diseases in Vietnam with about 320,702 cases and 54 deaths in the 2019 outbreak and 4548 clinical cases and six deaths, respectively. We suggest that mosquito-borne diseases could be effectively controlled and prevented through mechanical, chemical, biological, and genetic methods. Mosquito-borne diseases pose a significant threat to humans in almost every part of the world. Key factors such as global warming, climatic conditions, rapid urbanisation, frequent human relocation, and widespread deforestation significantly increase the number of mosquitoes and mosquito-borne diseases in Vietnam, and elsewhere around the world. In southeast Asia, and notably in Vietnam, national mosquito control programmes contribute to reducing the risk of mosquito-borne disease transmission, however, malaria and dengue remain a threat to public health. The aim of our review is to provide a complete checklist of all Vietnamese mosquitoes that have been recognised, as well as an overview of mosquito-borne diseases in Vietnam. A total of 281 mosquito species of 42 subgenera and 22 genera exist in Vietnam. Of those, Anopheles, Aedes, and Culex are found to be potential vectors for mosquito-borne diseases. Major mosquito-borne diseases in high-incidence areas of Vietnam include malaria, dengue, and Japanese encephalitis. This review may be useful to entomological researchers for future surveys of Vietnamese mosquitoes and to decision-makers responsible for vector control tactics.

TI  - Absence of Leishmaniinae and Nosematidae in stingless bees
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Bee pollination is an indispensable component of global food production and plays a crucial role in sustainable agriculture. The worldwide decline of bee populations, including wild pollinators, poses a threat to this system. However, most studies to date are situated in temperate regions where Apini and Bombini are very abundant pollinators. Tropical and subtropical regions where stingless bees (Apidae: Meliponini) are generally very common, are often overlooked. These bees also face pressure due to deforestation and agricultural intensification as well as the growing use and spread of exotic pollinators as Apis mellifera and Bombus species. The loss or decline of this important bee tribe would have a large impact on their provided ecosystem services, in both wild and agricultural landscapes. The importance of pollinator diseases, which can contribute to decline, has not been investigated so far in this bee tribe. Here we report on the first large pathogen screening of Meliponini species in southern Brazil. Remarkably we observed that there was an absence of Leishmaniinae and Nosematidae, and a very low occurrence of Apicystis bombi. Our data on disease prevalence in both understudied areas and species, can greatly improve our knowledge on the distribution of pathogens among bee species.

TI  - Soil texture prediction in tropical soils: A portable X-ray fluorescence spectrometry approach
T2  - GEODERMA
AB  - Soil texture is an important feature in soil characterization, although its laboratory determination is costly and time-consuming. As an alternative, this study aimed at predicting soil texture from portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) spectrometry data in Brazilian soils. 1565 soil samples (503 from superficial and 1062 from sub-superficial horizons) were analyzed in the laboratory for soil texture and scanned with the pXRF. Elemental contents determined by pXRF were correlated with soil texture and used to calibrate regression models through the generalized linear model (GLM), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF) algorithm. Models were created with 70% of the data using three datasets: i) only superficial horizon data; ii) only subsuperficial horizon data; and iii) data from both horizons. Validation was performed with 30% of the data. Clay content was positively correlated with Fe (0.79) and Al2O3 (0.41) reflecting the great residual concentration of Fe- and Al-oxides in this fraction. This same fraction correlated negatively with SiO2 (-0.75), while the sand fraction correlated positively with SiO2 corresponding to quartz dominance in the sand fraction of Brazilian soils. For the separated superficial and subsuperficial horizon datasets, SVM promoted the best predictions of clay (R-2 0.83; RMSE = 7.04%) and sand contents (R-2 0.87; RMSE = 9.11%), while RF provided the best results for silt (R-2 0.60; RMSE = 6.33%). When combining both datasets, RF was better for sand prediction (R-2 0.73; RMSE = 5.79%), while SVM promoted better predictions for silt (R-2 0.72; RMSE = 5.77%) and clay (R-2 0.84; RMSE = 7.08%). Elemental contents obtained by pXRF are capable of accurately predicting soil texture for a great variety of Brazilian soils.

TI  - BIOACTIVITY OF <i>Pseudomarasmius nidus</i>-<i>avis</i> AND OTHER WILD FUNGI FROM MESOPHYTIC MOUNTAIN FOREST IN MEXICO IN CONTROL OF PHYTOPATHOGENS
T2  - AGROCIENCIA
AB  - The mesophytic mountain forest is one of the most biodiverse ecosystems in Mexico, in which there is a diverse mycobiota of which many aspects of its biology and properties are unknown. Pseudomarasmius nidus-avis is a recently discovered and described fungus that forms rhizomorphs used in the nesting habits of birds of the family Tyrannidae (Mionectes oleagineus and Tolmomyias sulfurescens). In this work, the bioactive properties of P. nidus-avis, seven basidiomycetes and two wild ascomycetes from the mesophytic mountain forest of central Veracruz state, Mexico, were evaluated in terms of their effect against phytopathogenic fungal (PF) species such as Fusarium oxysporum (ATCC-417 and CBF-185), Sclerotium cepivorum (CBF414) and Leptosphaerulina australis (CBF-433), which generate important economic losses in several crops. In vitro confrontation tests of mycelium isolated from the macrofungi against the PFs were developed, where 50 % of the wild fungi, including P. nidus-avis, showed effect on the phytopathogens. Furthermore, the crude extract obtained from the mycelium and supernatant of P. nidus-avis was evaluated against PF, showing an inhibition of 16.08 % against F. oxysporum (ATCC-417). These results show that P. nidus-avis has bioactive properties with potential for use in the control of some PF diseases of agricultural and forestry importance.

TI  - ULTRA-LOW VOLUME APPLICATION OF SPINOSAD (NATULAR 2EC) LARVICIDE AS A RESIDUAL IN A TROPICAL ENVIRONMENT AGAINST <i>AEDES</i> AND <i>ANOPHELES</i> SPECIES
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MOSQUITO CONTROL ASSOCIATION
AB  - We investigated the efficacy of a liquid larvicide, Natular 2EC((R) )(spinosad), applied with ultra-low volume sprayer as a residual application during the dry season in southeastern Thailand against 4 medically important species Aedes aegypti, Ae. albopictus, Anopheles dirus, and An. minimus. We found that this larvicide could be applied as a residual to dry areas known to collect water and potentially still be effective after rains or irrigation, which could increase the flexibility and efficiency of an integrated vector management program targeting these species. This investigation also demonstrated, for the 1st time, efficacy of spinosad against An. minimus and An. dirus.

TI  - Breeding <i>Ruellia</i> and <i>Caladium</i> at the University of Florida
T2  - XI INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON FLOWER BULBS AND HERBACEOUS PERENNIALS
CP  - 11th International Symposium on Flower Bulbs and Herbaceous Perennials
AB  - Florida is among the largest producers of ornamental plants in the United States, therefore ornamental plant breeding is a major programmatic area in the Department of Environmental Horticulture at the University of Florida (UF). Currently, the UF ornamental plant breeding program focuses on improving approximately a dozen tropical and subtropical plants important to Florida. Among them are Ruellia and Caladium. Ruellia simplex (R. brittoniana, R. tweediana or Mexican petunia) is a popular landscape plant in southern states in the USA. However, this introduced plant has escaped cultivation and become invasive in natural areas. Currently, only one sterile cultivar with tall habit and purple flowers exists. Since 2007, the breeding objective at UF has been to develop sterile cultivars in other flower colors such as pink, white, white with a purple corolla tube, and potentially different growth habits such as tall and dwarf. Breeding approaches are ploidy manipulations and hybridizations. In 2011, selected breeding lines of R. simplex were evaluated in replicated field trials in four locations in Florida for landscape performance and sterility. One purple, one pink and one white breeding line have been selected for potential cultivar release. The primary objectives of Caladium breeding have been to develop new cultivars with novel leaf colors or coloration patterns, improved tuber yield, better resistance to soil-borne diseases, and enhanced tolerance to sun burn damage. Over the last seven years, 13 new cultivars have been released in the fancy-and lance-leaved groups. Efforts are being made to apply molecular markers to Caladium breeding. Ninety-nine SSR markers have been developed from mining enriched genomic sequences, and these markers have proven very powerful in discriminating cultivars and revealing genetic relations among cultivars.

TI  - A spatio-temporal analysis of scrub typhus and murine typhus in Laos; implications from changing landscapes and climate
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   Scrub typhus (ST) and murine typhus (MT) are common but poorly understood causes of fever in Laos. We examined the spatial and temporal distribution of ST and MT, with the intent of informing interventions to prevent and control both diseases.
   Methodology and principle findings
   This study included samples submitted from 2003 to 2017 to Mahosot Hospital, Vientiane, for ST and MT investigation. Serum samples were tested using IgM rapid diagnostic tests. Patient demographic data along with meteorological and environmental data from Laos were analysed. Approximately 17% of patients were positive for either ST (1,337/8,150 patients tested) or MT (1,283/7,552 patients tested). While both diseases occurred in inhabitants from Vientiane Capital, from the univariable analysis MT was positively and ST negatively associated with residence in Vientiane Capital. ST was highly seasonal, with cases two times more likely to occur during the wet season months of July-September compared to the dry season whilst MT peaked in the dry season. Multivariable regression analysis linked ST incidence to fluctuations in relative humidity whereas MT was linked to variation in temperature. Patients with ST infection were more likely to come from villages with higher levels of surface flooding and vegetation in the 16 days leading up to diagnosis.
   Conclusions
   The data suggest that as cities expand, high risk areas for MT will also expand. With global heating and risks of attendant higher precipitation, these data suggest that the incidence and spatial distribution of both MT and ST will increase.

TI  - A tour de force by Hawaii's invasive mammals: establishment, takeover, and ecosystem restoration through eradication
T2  - MAMMAL STUDY
AB  - Invasive mammals have irreversibly altered ecosystems of Hawai'i and other tropical Pacific islands in numerous cases through novel herbivory, predation, and diseases, thereby causing the disproportionate extinction of flora and fauna that occur nowhere else on Earth. The control and eradication of invasive mammals is the single most expensive management activity necessary for restoring ecological integrity to many natural areas of Hawai'i and other Pacific Islands, and have already advanced the restoration of native biota by removing herbivorous ungulates from >750 km(2). Rodenticides which have been tested and registered for hand and aerial broadcast in Hawai'i have been used to eradicate rats from remote islands to protect nesting seabirds and are now being applied to larger islands to protect forest birds. The exclusion of other invasive mammals is now being undertaken with more sophisticated control techniques and fences. New fence designs are capable of excluding all mammals from areas to protect endangered native birds. Although the eradication of mammals from large areas has resulted in the restoration of some ecosystem processes such as natural forest regeneration, changes in other processes such as fire regimes, nutrient cycling, and invasive plant proliferation remain more difficult to reverse at larger landscape scales.

TI  - Clinical, Cardiological and Serologic Follow-Up of Chagas Disease in Children and Adolescents from the Amazon Region, Brazil: Longitudinal Study
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE
AB  - Background:Outbreaks of Chagas disease (CD) by foodborne transmission is a problem related to deforestation, exposing people to triatomines infected by T. cruzi, in the Amazon region. Once involving long-time follow-up, the treatment efficacy of the CD during its acute phase is still unknown. The authors aim to describe the clinical and epidemiologic profile of children and adolescents with CD, as well as treatment and cardiac involvement during the follow-up.Methods: A descriptive cohort study was conducted from 1998 to 2013 among children and adolescents up to 18 years-old with confirmed diagnosis of CD. All participants met the criteria of CD in the acute phase.Results: A total of 126 outpatients were included and received treatment and follow-up examinations during a medium period of 10.9 years/person. Most of them (68.3%) had their diagnosis established during oral transmission outbreaks. The diagnostic method with the most positive results rate (80.9%) was the IgM class anti-T. cruziantibody test as an acute phase marker, followed by the thick blood smears (60.8%). Acute myopericarditis was demonstrated in 18.2% of the patients, most of them with favorable evolution, though 2.4% (3/126) persisted with cardiac injury observed at the end point of the follow-up.Conclusions: Antibodies againstT. cruzipersisted in 54.8% of sera from the patients without prognostic correlation with cardiac involvement. Precocious treatment can decrease potential cardiac complications and assure good treatment response, especially for inhabitants living in areas with difficult accessibility.

TI  - The Use of Xenosurveillance to Detect Human Bacteria, Parasites, and Viruses in Mosquito Bloodmeals
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Infectious disease surveillance is hindered by several factors, including limited infrastructure and geographic isolation of many resource-poor regions. In addition, the complexities of sample acquisition, processing, and analysis, even in developed regions, can be rate limiting. Therefore, new strategies to survey human populations for emerging pathogens are necessary. Xenosurveillance is a method that utilizes mosquitoes as sampling devices to search for genetic signatures of pathogens in vertebrates. Previously we demonstrated that xenosurveillance can detect viral RNA in both laboratory and field settings. However, its ability to detect bacteria and parasites remains to be assessed. Accordingly, we fed Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes blood that contained Trypanosoma brucei gambiense and Bacillus anthracis. In addition, we determined whether two additional emerging viruses, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus and Zika virus could be detected by this method. Pathogen-specific real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to evaluate the sensitivity of xenosurveillance across multiple pathogen taxa and over time. We detected RNA from all pathogens at clinically relevant concentrations from mosquitoes processed up to 1 day postbloodfeeding. These results demonstrate that xenosurveillance may be used as a tool to expand surveillance for viral, parasitic, and bacterial pathogens in resource-limited areas.

TI  - Brown root rot of trees caused by Phellinus noxius in the Ryukyu Islands, subtropical areas of Japan
T2  - FOREST PATHOLOGY
AB  - The fungus Phellinus noxius has a broad host range and causes brown root rot in a variety of tree species of various ages, irrespective of their original health. The fungus is widely distributed in tropical countries of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands and Australia, Central America and Caribbean, and Africa. Since 1988, when brown root rot was first found on Ishigaki Island, Okinawa Prefecture, the disease has been reported on several islands in Okinawa and Kagoshima Prefectures, and it has been causing serious problems to shade, windbreak, ornamental and landscape trees in the Ryukyu Islands, located in the subtropical region of southern Japan. Here, we report on the current status of P.similar to noxius-caused brown root rot in the Ryukyu Islands, Japan, including symptoms, occurrence, dispersal, distribution and host tree species of the disease, pathogenicity and/or virulence of the pathogen, and disease management based on our surveys and previously published reports from Japan. Brown root rot has been confirmed in 53 tree species from 32 plant families at different sites on 10 of the 12 islands surveyed. Among the 53 tree species, 34 were first recorded in Japan as host plants of P.similar to noxius. The disease occurs mainly in shade, ornamental and windbreak trees at sightseeing places, parks, roadsides, agricultural land such as sugar cane fields, and around residences or other places associated with human activities.

TI  - The use of a dipstick antigen-capture assay for the diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum infection in a remote forested area of central India
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - A study was carried out in a highly malarious forested belt of central India (Madhya Pradesh) to evaluate the usefulness of a dipstick antigen-capture assay (ParaSight(R)F) as a diagnostic method for Plasmodium falciparum appropriate for field use. In all, 1,231 patients with fever were screened in parallel with the tailing of thick blood smears. The sensitivity and specificity of the dipstick test for detection of P. falciparum were 93% and 92.5%, respectively. Results also indicate that the dipstick test result became negative within seven days after initiation of curative chemotherapy in the majority of cases (95%). Tribal populations in remote forested areas are important reservoirs of P. falciparum that are mostly resistant to standard antimalarial drugs and a source of malaria to the rest of the country. Control of malaria is limited by inaccessibility, lack of medical services, public ignorance of the disease, and other technical problems. In this population, the dipstick assay was found to be highly accurate, simple, and rapid, suggesting that it may be used in remote forested areas without the need for microscopic examination. The simplicity of the dipstick test enabled administration of more effective and expensive antimalarials preventing further buildup and dissemination of resistant parasites and a return of symptoms.

TI  - Patterns in distribution, population density and uses of medicinal plants along the altitudinal gradient in Dhauladhar mountain range of Indian Himalayas
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
AB  - We studied the patterns in distribution, population density and uses of medicinal plant species in Dhauladhar mountain range of Himachal Pradesh in Indian Himalayas. The study area was stratified into three zones on the basis of forest types and altitudes. In each zone, quadrats were laid down for sampling of plant species, and the local people were interviewed for gathering information on medicinal uses of plants. A total of 184 plant species were encountered in the sampling plots, of which 86% had medicinal uses. Among woody plant species, the use of bark was highest, whereas in herbaceous species the use of leaf and root was highest for treatment of over 32 groups of diseases. In terms of density, Pinus roxburghii was the most dominant tree species in subtropical forests, which declined in temperate regions and was absent in subalpine forests. Rhododendron arboreum was the most dominant tree species in temperate region whereas in subalpine forests it was replaced by Abies pindrow, in terms of density. Berberis asiatica and Vitex negundo were the most dominant shrubs in subtropical forests besides Lantana camera, whereas Berberis lycium dominated the temperate and Juniperus indica dominated the subalpine forests. The heavy infestation of Lantana camera in sub-tropical forests has degraded the habitats of native medicinal plant species. Spearman's correlation indicates positive correlation between local uses and density of respective medicinal plant species (P < 0.05). The results are further discussed in light of medicinal plants conservation in this part of the Indian Himalayas.

TI  - Control of invasive alien weeds averts imminent plant extinction
T2  - BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS
AB  - Invasive alien species constitute a major threat to biodiversity and cases of extinction caused by invasive alien animals are abundant. However, while invasive alien plants also harm native biota there exists a lack of cases demonstrating their ability to cause extinction of native plant species. Different alien species (vertebrates, invertebrates, pathogens etc.) commonly deliver different simultaneous impacts like predation, disease or competition. In such situations, assessing the contribution of plant invasion in causing decline of a given plant population in its natural habitat can be difficult, yet is desirable to avoid or minimize wastage of managers' resources. Using native angiosperms in lowland wet forests of Mauritius, we first compared native seedling diversity in forest areas that have been weeded of invasive alien plants about a decade previously, with adjacent similar but non-weeded areas. Then, using the weeded area, we compared results of native plant surveys carried out around the time that invasive alien plants were controlled, with the same community about a decade latter. Species richness and abundance of seedlings were higher in the weeded areas compared to the adjacent non weeded forest. We also found that several species that were presumed extinct or critically threatened with extinction had recovered dramatically as a consequence of the sole removal of invasive alien plants. This shows that the threat posed by invasive alien plants can be overwhelmingly important in driving native plant population declines in tropical forests and that imminent plant extinctions can be averted by timely control of alien plants.

TI  - Leveraging weather data for forecasting cases-to-mortality rates due to COVID-19
T2  - CHAOS SOLITONS & FRACTALS
AB  - There are several recent publications criticizing the failure of COVID-19 forecasting models, with swinging over predictions and underpredictions, which have made it difficult for decision and policy making. Observing the failures of several COVID-19 forecasting models and the alarming spread of the virus, we seek to use some stable response for forecasting COVID-19, viz., ratios of COVID-19 cases to mortalities, rather than COVID-19 cases or fatalities. A trend of low COVID-19 cases-to-mortality ratios calls for urgent attention: the need for vaccines, for instance. Studies have shown that there are influences of weather parameters on COVID-19; and COVID-19 may have come to stay and could manifest a seasonal outbreak profile similar to other infectious respiratory diseases. In this paper, the influences of some weather, geographical, economic and demographic covariates were evaluated on COVID-19 response based on a series of Granger-causality tests. The effect of four weather parameters, viz., temperature, rainfall, solar irradiation and relative humidity, on daily COVID-19 cases-to-mortality ratios of 36 countries from 5 continents of the world were determined through regression analysis. Regression studies show that these four weather factors impact ratios of COVID-19 cases-to-mortality differently. The most impactful factor is temperature which is positively correlated with COVID-19 cases-to-mortality responses in 24 out of 36 countries. Temperature minimally affects COVID-19 cases-to-mortality ratios in the tropical countries. The most influential weather factor - temperature - was incorporated in training random forest and deep learning models for forecasting the cases-to-mortality rate of COVID-19 in clusters of countries in the world with similar weather conditions. Evaluation of trained forecasting models incorporating temperature features show better performance compared to a similar set of models trained without temperature features. This implies that COVID-19 forecasting models will predict more accurately if temperature features are factored in, especially for temperate countries. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Entomological and Anthropological Factors Contributing to Persistent Malaria Transmission in Kenya, Ethiopia, and Cameroon
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB  - Introduction. In order to improve our understanding of the fundamental limits of core interventions and guide efforts based on prioritization and identification of effective/novel interventions with great potentials to interrupt persistent malaria transmission in the context of high vector control coverage, the drivers of persistent disease transmission were investigated in three eco-epidemiological settings; forested areas in Cameroon, coastal area in Kenya and highland areas in Ethiopia.
   Methods. Mosquitoes were sampled in three eco-epidemiological settings using different entomological sampling techniques and analysed for Plasmodium infection status and blood meal origin in blood-fed specimens. Human behavioural surveys were conducted to assess the knowledge and attitude of the population on malaria and preventive measures, their night activities, and sleeping pattern. The parasitological analysis was conducted to determine the prevalence of Plasmodium infection in the population using rapid diagnostic tests.
   Results. Despite the diversity in the mosquito fauna, their biting behaviour was found to be closely associated to human behaviour in the three settings. People in Kenya and Ethiopia were found to be more exposed to mosquito bites during the early hours of the evening (18-21h) while it was in the early morning (4-6 am) in Cameroon. Malaria transmission was high in Cameroon compared to Kenya and Ethiopia with over 50% of the infected bites recorded outdoors. The non-users of LLINs were 2.5 to 3 times more likely to be exposed to the risk of acquiring malaria compared to LLINs users. Malaria prevalence was high (42%) in Cameroon, and more than half of the households visited had at least one individual infected with Plasmodium parasites.
   Conclusions. The study suggests high outdoor malaria transmission occurring in the three sites with however different determinants driving residual malaria transmission in these areas.

TI  - Global Honey Bee Viral Landscape Altered by a Parasitic Mite
T2  - SCIENCE
AB  - Emerging diseases are among the greatest threats to honey bees. Unfortunately, where and when an emerging disease will appear are almost impossible to predict. The arrival of the parasitic Varroa mite into the Hawaiian honey bee population allowed us to investigate changes in the prevalence, load, and strain diversity of honey bee viruses. The mite increased the prevalence of a single viral species, deformed wing virus (DWV), from similar to 10 to 100% within honey bee populations, which was accompanied by a millionfold increase in viral titer and a massive reduction in DWV diversity, leading to the predominance of a single DWV strain. Therefore, the global spread of Varroa has selected DWV variants that have emerged to allow it to become one of the most widely distributed and contagious insect viruses on the planet.

T2  - FOREST PATHOLOGY
AB  - This study describes and identifies the fungi associated with root-rot disease in Eucalyptus pellita, associated anecdotally with a species of Phellinus. Macro- and microscopic morphological observations and DNA analysis were used to identify sporocarps and fungal cultures growing from symptomatic root samples. Investigation of 12 sites in Central Sumatra revealed that red root-rot disease caused by species of Ganoderma (most commonly Ganoderma philippii) was as prevalent as root disease caused by Phellinus noxius. The study also detected the presence of several potential fungal agents of root rot at any one site. Fungal signs such as absence/presence of sporocarps were a poor indicator of root-rot incidence in stands. Instead, fungal isolation from infected roots was essential to obtain accurate identification of active pathogens.

TI  - Echinococcosis in wild carnivorous species: Epidemiology, genotypic diversity, and implications for veterinary public health
T2  - VETERINARY PARASITOLOGY
AB  - Echinococcosis is a zoonosis caused by helminths of the genus Echinococcus. The infection, one of the 17 neglected tropical diseases listed by the World Health Organization, has a cosmopolitan distribution and can be transmitted through a variety of domestic, synanthropic, and sylvatic cycles. Wildlife has been increasingly regarded as a relevant source of infection to humans, as demonstrated by the fact that a significant proportion of human emerging infectious diseases have a wildlife origin. Based on available epidemiological and molecular evidence, of the nine Echinococcus species currently recognized as valid taxa, E. canadensis G8-G10, E. felidis, E. multilocularis, E. oligarthrus, E. shiquicus, and E. vogeli are primarily transmitted in the wild. E. canadensis G6-G7, E. equinus, E. granulosus s.s., and E. ortleppi are considered to be transmitted mainly through domestic cycles. We summarize here current knowledge on the global epidemiology, geographical distribution and genotype frequency of Echinococcus spp. in wild carnivorous species. Topics addressed include the significance of the wildlife/livestock/human interface, the sympatric occurrence of different Echinococcus species in a given epidemiological scenario, and the role of wildlife as natural reservoir of disease to human and domestic animal populations. We have also discussed the impact that human activity and intervention may cause in the transmission dynamics of echinococcosis, including the human population expansion an encroachment on shrinking natural habitats, the increasing urbanization of wildlife carnivorous species and the related establishment of synanthropic cycles of Echinococcus spp., the land use (e.g. deforestation and agricultural practices), and the unsupervised international trade and translocation of wildlife animals. Following the 'One Health' approach, we have also emphasized that successful veterinary public health interventions in the field of echinococcosis requires an holistic approach to integrate current knowledge on human medicine, veterinary medicine and environmental sciences.

Two of the patients died and the other 4 recovered completely. Four more patients, 3 males and 1 female, were diagnosed serologically by immunoglobulin M capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and seroconversion in acute and convalescent blood samples examined by indirect immunofluorescent test using Vero cells infected with the isolated virus. The virus identity was confirmed at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Fort Collins, Colorado, USA, by the polymerase chain reaction; it was closely related to Kayasanur Forest disease virus. All infected patients had similar clinical and laboratory symptoms and signs, including fever, headache, generalized body aches, arthralgia, anorexia, vomiting, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes (serum glutamic oxalacetic and serum glutamic pyruvic transaminases), elevated creatinine phosphokinase, and elevated blood urea. One patient developed symptoms of encephalitis, but survived without any sequel. Skin rash developed in 2 patients, morbilliform on the hands, feet, and lower abdomen of one patient and purpuric associated with melaena in the second patient. Eight of the 10 confirmed patients were working with sheep, and the disease may be a zoonotic viral infection.

TI  - Mosquito Net Ownership, Utilization, and Preferences among Mobile and Migrant Populations Sleeping in Forests and Farms in Central Vietnam: A Cross-Sectional Study
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Strengthening vector control measures among mobile and migrant populations (MMPs) is crucial to malaria elimination, particularly in areas with multidrug-resistant malaria. Although a global priority, providing access and ensuring high coverage of available tools such as long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) among these vulnerable groups remains a significant challenge. We assessed mosquito net ownership, utilization, and preference among individuals who slept in a forest and/or on a farm against those residing only in village "home" settings in a priority malaria elimination area of Vietnam. Proportions of respondents owning bed nets were similar among forest, farm, and home sleeping sites, ranging between 96% and 98%. The proportion of respondents owning hammock nets was higher for the forest group (92%), whereas ownership of hammocks in general was significantly lower for the home group (55%). Most respondents (97%) preferred to bring hammock nets to their remote sleeping site, whereas a smaller proportion (25%) also considered bed nets as an option. Respondent preferences included thick hammock nets with zippers (53%), hammocks with a flip cover (17%), and thin hammock nets with zippers (15%), with none choosing polyethylene (hard) LLINs. Although there is high coverage and access to nets for this high-priority MMP group, there was a noted gap between coverage and net use, potentially undermining the effectiveness of net-related interventions that could impact malaria prevention and elimination efforts in Vietnam. The design and material of nets are important factors for user preferences that appear to drive net use.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Hantavirus Cardiopulmonary Syndrome Transmission Risk in Brazil
T2  - VIRUSES-BASEL
AB  - Background: Hantavirus disease in humans is rare but frequently lethal in the Neotropics. Several abundant and widely distributed Sigmodontinae rodents are the primary hosts of Orthohantavirus and, in combination with other factors, these rodents can shape hantavirus disease. Here, we assessed the influence of host diversity, climate, social vulnerability and land use change on the risk of hantavirus disease in Brazil over 24 years. Methods: Landscape variables (native forest, forestry, sugarcane, maize and pasture), climate (temperature and precipitation), and host biodiversity (derived through niche models) were used in spatiotemporal models, using the 5570 Brazilian municipalities as units of analysis. Results: Amounts of native forest and sugarcane, combined with temperature, were the most important factors influencing the increase of disease risk. Population at risk (rural workers) and rodent host diversity also had a positive effect on disease risk. Conclusions: Land use change-especially the conversion of native areas to sugarcane fields-can have a significant impact on hantavirus disease risk, likely by promoting the interaction between the people and the infected rodents. Our results demonstrate the importance of understanding the interactions between landscape change, rodent diversity, and hantavirus disease incidence, and suggest that land use policy should consider disease risk. Meanwhile, our risk map can be used to help allocate preventive measures to avoid disease.

TI  - Rickettsial agents in avian ixodid ticks in northeast Brazil
T2  - TICKS AND TICK-BORNE DISEASES
AB  - Birds are important in the maintenance and spread of ticks and tick-borne diseases. In this context we screened birds in the Atlantic forest north of the Sao Francisco River and Caatinga in northeast Brazil. In the Atlantic forest Amblyomma longirostre, Amblyomma nodosum, Amblyomma varium and Amblyomma auricularium were identified. A. longirostre was infected by "Candidatus Rickettsia amblyommii" and A. nodosum by a Rickettsia parkeri-like agent. In Caatinga, Ambiyomma parvum and A. auricularium were identified. A. auricularium was infected by "Ca. R. amblyommii" and Rickettsia bellii. "Canditatus Rickettsia andenae" was also identified in A. parvum collected from birds in Caatinga. In addition, Rickettsia sp. genotype AL was identified in A. varium collected on the clothes of the field team in one area of Atlantic forest. Here we provide a series of new host records for several Neotropical Amblyomma species and document rickettsial infections of "Ca. R. amblyomii" and a R. parkeri-like agent in Paraiba State, and R. bellii and "Ca. R. andenae" in Bahia State. For the first time we provide information regarding the infection of A. varium by "Ca. R. amblyommii". (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

TI  - Assessing Sumatran Peat Vulnerability to Fire under Various Condition of ENSO Phases Using Machine Learning Approaches
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - In recent decades, catastrophic wildfire episodes within the Sumatran peatland have contributed to a large amount of greenhouse gas emissions. The El-Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) modulates the occurrence of fires in Indonesia through prolonged hydrological drought. Thus, assessing peatland vulnerability to fires and understanding the underlying drivers are essential to developing adaptation and mitigation strategies for peatland. Here, we quantify the vulnerability of Sumatran peat to fires under various ENSO conditions (i.e., El-Nino, La-Nina, and Normal phases) using correlative modelling approaches. This study used climatic (i.e., annual precipitation, SPI, and KBDI), biophysical (i.e., below-ground biomass, elevation, slope, and NBR), and proxies to anthropogenic disturbance variables (i.e., access to road, access to forests, access to cities, human modification, and human population) to assess fire vulnerability within Sumatran peatlands. We created an ensemble model based on various machine learning approaches (i.e., random forest, support vector machine, maximum entropy, and boosted regression tree). We found that the ensemble model performed better compared to a single algorithm for depicting fire vulnerability within Sumatran peatlands. The NBR highly contributed to the vulnerability of peatland to fire in Sumatra in all ENSO phases, followed by the anthropogenic variables. We found that the high to very-high peat vulnerability to fire increases during El-Nino conditions with variations in its spatial patterns occurring under different ENSO phases. This study provides spatially explicit information to support the management of peat fires, which will be particularly useful for identifying peatland restoration priorities based on peatland vulnerability to fire maps. Our findings highlight Riau's peatland as being the area most prone to fires area on Sumatra Island. Therefore, the groundwater level within this area should be intensively monitored to prevent peatland fires. In addition, conserving intact forests within peatland through the moratorium strategy and restoring the degraded peatland ecosystem through canal blocking is also crucial to coping with global climate change.

TI  - Molecular Detection of Dengue Virus, Zika Virus, and Chikungunya Virus Arboviruses in Neotropical Bats
T2  - VECTOR-BORNE AND ZOONOTIC DISEASES
AB  - Background: The dengue, Zika, and Chikungunya arboviruses have spread in America in the past year, thus becoming global health issues. These viruses are maintained in nature in two transmission cycles: an urban cycle, transmitted from hematophagous mosquitoes to humans, and a wild cycle, recorded only in Africa and Asia, involving mosquitoes and nonhuman primates as natural hosts. The evidence shows that these arboviruses infect other wild mammals in America, such as rodents, marsupials, and bats. This study aimed to determine the potential natural infection of arboviruses in bats captured in contrasting sites (tropical forests, urban areas, and caves) in Oaxaca, Mexico.Materials and Methods: Liver samples were collected from some bats and tested for RNA from dengue, Zika, and Chikungunya with the quantitative real-time PCR assay. We analyzed 162 samples that encompassed 23 bat species. Results: No natural infection with any of the three arboviruses was detected in any sample tested. Conclusion: The existence of a wild cycle of the three arboviruses in the American continent is not ruled out. However, owing to the low or zero prevalence recorded in other studies and the present study, bats are likely involved in the arbovirus transmission cycle as accidental hosts.

TI  - Linear and Machine Learning modelling for spatiotemporal disease predictions: Force-of-Infection of Chagas disease
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   Chagas disease is a long-lasting disease with a prolonged asymptomatic period. Cumulative indices of infection such as prevalence do not shed light on the current epidemiological situation, as they integrate infection over long periods. Instead, metrics such as the Force-of-Infection (FoI) provide information about the rate at which susceptible people become infected and permit sharper inference about temporal changes in infection rates. FoI is estimated by fitting (catalytic) models to available age-stratified serological (ground-truth) data. Predictive FoI modelling frameworks are then used to understand spatial and temporal trends indicative of heterogeneity in transmission and changes effected by control interventions. Ideally, these frameworks should be able to propagate uncertainty and handle spatiotemporal issues.
   Methodology/principal findings
   We compare three methods in their ability to propagate uncertainty and provide reliable estimates of FoI for Chagas disease in Colombia as a case study: two Machine Learning (ML) methods (Boosted Regression Trees (BRT) and Random Forest (RF)), and a Linear Model (LM) framework that we had developed previously. Our analyses show consistent results between the three modelling methods under scrutiny. The predictors (explanatory variables) selected, as well as the location of the most uncertain FoI values, were coherent across frameworks. RF was faster than BRT and LM, and provided estimates with fewer extreme values when extrapolating to areas where no ground-truth data were available. However, BRT and RF were less efficient at propagating uncertainty.
   Conclusions/significance
   The choice of FoI predictive models will depend on the objectives of the analysis. ML methods will help characterise the mean behaviour of the estimates, while LM will provide insight into the uncertainty surrounding such estimates. Our approach can be extended to the modelling of FoI patterns in other Chagas disease-endemic countries and to other infectious diseases for which serosurveys are regularly conducted for surveillance.
   Author summary
   Metrics such as the per susceptible rate of infection acquisition (Force-of-Infection) are crucial to understand the current epidemiological situation and the impact of control interventions for long-lasting diseases in which the infection event might have occurred many years previously, such as Chagas disease. FoI values are estimated from serological age profiles, often obtained in a few locations. However, when using predictive models to estimate the FoI over time and space (including areas where serosurveys had not been conducted), methods able to handle and propagate uncertainty must be implemented; otherwise, overconfident predictions may be obtained. Although Machine Learning (ML) methods are powerful tools, they may not be able to entirely handle this challenge. Therefore, the use of ML must be considered in relation to the aims of the analyses. ML will be more relevant to characterise the central trends of the estimates while Linear Models will help identify areas where further serosurveys should be conducted to improve the reliability of the predictions. Our approaches can be used to generate FoI predictions in other Chagas disease-endemic countries as well as in other diseases for which serological surveillance data are collected.

TI  - Asymptomatic Orthopoxvirus Circulation in Humans in the Wake of a Monkeypox Outbreak among Chimpanzees in Cameroon
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Monkeypox virus is a zoonotic Orthopoxvirus (OPXV) that causes smallpox-like illness in humans. In Cameroon, human monkeypox cases were confirmed in 2018, and outbreaks in captive chimpanzees occurred in 2014 and 2016. We investigated the OPXV serological status among staff at a primate sanctuary (where the 2016 chimpanzee outbreak occurred) and residents from nearby villages, and describe contact with possible monkeypox reservoirs. We focused specifically on Gambian rats (Cricetomys spp.) because they are recognized possible reservoirs and because contact with Gambian rats was common enough to render sufficient statistical power. We collected one 5-mL whole blood specimen from each participant to perform a generic anti-OPXV ELISA test for IgG and IgM antibodies and administered a questionnaire about prior symptoms of monkeypox-like illness and contact with possible reservoirs. Our results showed evidence of OPXV exposures (IgG positive, 6.3%; IgM positive, 1.6%) among some of those too young to have received smallpox vaccination (born after 1980, n = 63). No participants reported prior symptoms consistent with monkeypox. After adjusting for education level, participants who frequently visited the forest were more likely to have recently eaten Gambian rats (OR: 3.36, 95% CI: 1.91-5.92, P < 0.001) and primate sanctuary staff were less likely to have touched or sold Gambian rats (OR: 0.23, 95% CI: 0.19-0.28, P < 0.001). The asymptomatic or undetected circulation of OPXVs in humans in Cameroon is likely, and contact with monkeypox reservoirs is common, raising the need for continued surveillance for human and animal disease.

TI  - Diversity and Distribution of <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i> and Its Related Species in Izu and Ogasawara Islands, Japan
T2  - MEDICAL MYCOLOGY JOURNAL
AB  - The taxon Aspergillus section Fumigati comprises several causative agents of aspergillosis. Here, the distribution of Aspergillus sect. Fumigati in outdoor environments of Izu and Ogasawara Islands was investigated. Different strains were isolated from soil samples collected from 68 sites on 9 islands (Izu-oshima, Toshima, Shikinejima, Kozushima, Miyakejima, Hachijojima, Mukojima, Chichijima, and Hahajima), including different landscapes, and identified using morphological characteristics and calmodulin (CaM) sequences. Seven Aspergillus sect. Fumigati species were identified. The occurrence frequency of Aspergillus fumigatus was higher in forest sites on the islands, except for Ogasawara Islands, whereas that of species other than A. fumigatus was higher in bare land and grassland sites on all islands. The occurrence frequency of A. fumigatus was more than 50% on islands between Izu-oshima and Toshima, decreased on islands between Shikinejima and Hachijojima, and was zero on Ogasawara Islands. Considering other Aspergillus species, Aspergillus felis showed high occurrence frequency on islands between Izu-oshima and Shikinejima, Aspergillus pseudoviridinutans on islands between Kozushima and Hachijojima, and Aspergillus udagawae on Ogasawara Islands. At two study sites (grassland and forest sites), the soil was sampled throughout the year to evaluate whether the occurrence frequency of each fungal species was affected by sampling season. At the grassland site, A. pseudoviridinutans was isolated at more than 90% frequency, regardless of the sampling season. A. fumigatus occurrence frequency at the forest site ranged from 0% to 60% and greatly varied among sampling seasons. Thus, differences in island location and landscape affected the distribution of Aspergillus sect. Fumigati.

TI  - Identification of <i>Hortaea werneckii</i> Isolated from Mangrove Plant <i>Aegiceras</i> <i>comiculatum</i> Based on Morphology and rDNA Sequences
T2  - MYCOPATHOLOGIA
AB  - Hortaea werneckii is a black yeast-like ascomycetous fungi associated with the human superficial infection tinea nigra, which commonly occurs in tropical and subtropical countries. Now, this fungus has been found in the halophilic environment all over the world and recognized as a new model organism in exploring the mechanisms of salt tolerance in eukaryotes. During a survey of endophytic fungi of mangrove forest at South China Sea, two isolates of H. werneckii were recovered from medicinal plant of Aegiceras comiculatum. The isolates were identified by morphological characters and phylogenetic analyses (e.g., ITS rDNA, LSU rDNA and translation elongation factor EF1 alpha). Some physiological tests such as thermotolerance, acid tolerance (pH) and NaCl tolerance as well as pathogenicity test in vitro for the strains of Hortaea were performed. It is the first report that H. werneckii was isolated from medicinal plant of A. comiculatum in south sea of China as the endophytic fungi.

TI  - Genetic structure in the southernmost populations of black-and-gold howler monkeys (<i>Alouatta caraya</i>) and its conservation implications
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Black-and-gold howler monkeys Alouatta caraya, are arboreal primates, inhabitants of Neotropical forests, highly susceptible to the yellow fever virus, considered early 'sentinels' of outbreaks, and thus, of major epidemiological importance. Currently, anthropogenic habitat loss and modifications threatens their survival. Habitat modification can prevent, reduce or change dispersal behavior, which, in turn, may influence patterns of gene flow. We explored past and contemporary levels of genetic diversity, elucidated genetic structure and identified its possible drivers, in ten populations (n = 138) located in the southernmost distribution range of the species in South America, in Argentina and Paraguay. Overall, genetic variability was moderate (ten microsatellites: 3.16 +/- 0.18 alleles per locus, allelic richness of 2.93 +/- 0.81, 0.443 +/- 0.025 unbiased expected heterozygosity; 22 haplotypes of 491-bp mitochondrial Control Region, haplotypic diversity of 0.930 +/- 0.11, and nucleotide diversity of 0.01 +/- 0.007). Significant evidence of inbreeding was found in a population that was, later, decimated by yellow fever. Population-based gene flow measures (FST = 0.13;. ST = 018), hierarchical analysis of molecular variance and Bayesian clustering methods revealed significant genetic structure, grouping individuals into four clusters. Shared haplotypes and lack of mitochondrial differentiation (non-significant. ST) among some populations seem to support the hypothesis of historical dispersal via riparian forests. Current resistance analyses revealed a significant role of landscape features in modeling contemporary gene flow: continuous forest and riparian forests could promote genetic exchange, whereas disturbed forests or crop/grassland fields may restrict it. Estimates of effective population size allow anticipating that the studied populations will lose 75% of heterozygosity in less than 50 generations. Our findings suggest that anthropogenic modifications on native forests, increasingly ongoing in Northeastern Argentina, Southern Paraguay and Southeastern Brazil, might prevent the dispersal of howlers, leading to population isolation. To ensure long-term viability and maintain genetic connectivity of A. caraya remnant populations, we recommend preserving and restoring habitat continuity. To conserve the species genetic pool, as well, the four genetic clusters identified here should be considered separate Management Units and given high conservation priority. In light of our findings and considering complementary non-genetic information, we suggest upgrading the international conservation status of A. caraya to "Vulnerable".

TI  - Forest malaria in Chhindwara, Madhya Pradesh, Central India: A case study in a tribal community
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Parasitologic and entomologic cross-sectional surveys were carried out during an outbreak of malaria between December 1998 and August 2000 in forest villages near the Mohkhed Primary Health Center in the Chhindwara District of Madhya Pradesh in central India. In December 1998, surveys showed that more than 70% of the fever cases had malaria, with 87% of the malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum. The rate of enlarged spleens in children was 74.5%. In November 1999, 58% of the inhabitants were infected with malaria, with 80% of these cases caused by P. falciparum., Chloroquine resistance was seen in 23% of the cases. Anopheles culicifacies was the dominant mosquito species in all surveys (70-85%) and was resistant to DDT. The results indicate that the incidence of malaria in Chhindwara has increased gradually from 0.31 per 1,000 in 1990 to 6.75 per 1,000 in 2000. Improved access to treatment facilities, combination therapy, and vector control using an effective insecticide appear to be the most promising methods for controlling malaria in this region.

TI  - Ecological and socioeconomic factors associated with the human burden of environmentally mediated pathogens: a global analysis
T2  - LANCET PLANETARY HEALTH
AB  - Background:Billions of people living in poverty are at risk of environmentally mediated infectious diseases-that is, pathogens with environmental reservoirs that affect disease persistence and control and where environmental control of pathogens can reduce human risk. The complex ecology of these diseases creates a global health problem not easily solved with medical treatment alone. Methods:We quantified the current global disease burden caused by environmentally mediated infectious diseases and used a structural equation model to explore environmental and socioeconomic factors associated with the human burden of environmentally mediated pathogens across all countries. Findings:We found that around 80% (455 of 560) of WHO-tracked pathogen species known to infect humans are environmentally mediated, causing about 40% (129 488 of 359 341 disability-adjusted life years) of contemporary infectious disease burden (global loss of 130 million years of healthy life annually). The majority of this environmentally mediated disease burden occurs in tropical countries, and the poorest countries carry the highest burdens across all latitudes. We found weak associations between disease burden and biodiversity or agricultural land use at the global scale. In contrast, the proportion of people with rural poor livelihoods in a country was a strong proximate indicator of environmentally mediated infectious disease burden. Political stability and wealth were associated with improved sanitation, better health care, and lower proportions of rural poverty, indirectly resulting in lower burdens of environmentally mediated infections. Rarely, environmentally mediated pathogens can evolve into global pandemics (eg, HIV, COVID-19) affecting even the wealthiest communities. Interpretation:The high and uneven burden of environmentally mediated infections highlights the need for innovative social and ecological interventions to complement biomedical advances in the pursuit of global health and sustainability goals.

TI  - Experimental Science for the 'Bananapocalypse': Counter Politics in the Plantationocene
T2  - ETHNOS
AB  - The plantation has become a landscape of political impossibility. Its industrial modes of production and scientific management pose existential threats to local lifeways, stymie social justice movements, and unleash persistent ecological harms. This article argues that a renewed scientific sensibility offers a way to expand local strategies for transformative political praxis in the face of other political constraints. It introduces the notion of 'science-in-vivo', a method of experimentation that has emerged in the context of Philippine banana plantations ravaged by the 'incurable' fungal disease Fusarium Wilt Tropical Race Four, also known as Panama Disease. Literally 'science within the living body', the method combines secular and non-secular thought, and gathers human, nonhuman, and extrahuman forces in ways that break down some of the hegemonic antagonisms that define plantation life. It was inspired, originally, by a series of God-given dreams about microbes in the forests of southern Mindanao.

TI  - Defining the Risk of Zika and Chikungunya Virus Transmission in Human Population Centers of the Eastern United States
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - The recent spread of mosquito-transmitted viruses and associated disease to the Americas motivates a new, data-driven evaluation of risk in temperate population centers. Temperate regions are generally expected to pose low risk for significant mosquito-borne disease; however, the spread of the Asian tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus) across densely populated urban areas has established a new landscape of risk. We use a model informed by field data to assess the conditions likely to facilitate local transmission of chikungunya and Zika viruses from an infected traveler to Ae. albopictus and then to other humans in USA cities with variable human densities and seasonality. Mosquito-borne disease occurs when specific combinations of conditions maximize virus-to-mosquito and mosquito-to-human contact rates. We develop a mathematical model that captures the epidemiology and is informed by current data on vector ecology from urban sites. The model demonstrates that under specific but realistic conditions, fifty-percent of introductions by infectious travelers to a high human, high mosquito density city could initiate local transmission and 10% of the introductions could result in 100 or more people infected. Despite the propensity for Ae. albopictus to bite non-human vertebrates, we also demonstrate that local virus transmission and human outbreaks may occur when vectors feed from humans even just 40% of the time. Inclusion of human behavioral changes and mitigations were not incorporated into the models and would likely reduce predicted infections. This work demonstrates how a conditional series of non-average events can result in local arbovirus transmission and outbreaks of human disease, even in temperate cities.

TI  - Statistical modeling based on structured surveys of Australian native possum excreta harboring <i>Mycobacterium ulcerans</i> predicts Buruli ulcer occurrence in humans
T2  - ELIFE
AB  - Background: Buruli ulcer (BU) is a neglected tropical disease caused by infection of subcutaneous tissue with Mycobacterium ulcerans. BU is commonly reported across rural regions of Central and West Africa but has been increasing dramatically in temperate southeast Australia around the major metropolitan city of Melbourne, with most disease transmission occurring in the summer months. Previous research has shown that Australian native possums are reservoirs of M. ulcerans and that they shed the bacteria in their fecal material (excreta). Field surveys show that locales where possums harbor M. ulcerans overlap with human cases of BU, raising the possibility of using possum excreta surveys to predict the risk of disease occurrence in humans.Methods: We thus established a highly structured 12 month possum excreta surveillance program across an area of 350 km(2) in the Mornington Peninsula area 70 km south of Melbourne, Australia. The primary objective of our study was to assess using statistical modeling if M. ulcerans surveillance of possum excreta provided useful information for predicting future human BU case locations.Results: Over two sampling campaigns in summer and winter, we collected 2,282 possum excreta specimens of which 11% were PCR positive for M. ulcerans-specific DNA. Using the spatial scanning statistical tool SaTScan, we observed non-random, co-correlated clustering of both M. ulcerans positive possum excreta and human BU cases. We next trained a statistical model with the Mornington Peninsula excreta survey data to predict the future likelihood of human BU cases occurring in the region. By observing where human BU cases subsequently occurred, we show that the excreta model performance was superior to a null model trained using the previous year's human BU case incidence data (AUC 0.66 vs 0.55). We then used data unseen by the excreta-informed model from a new survey of 661 possum excreta specimens in Geelong, a geographically separate BU endemic area to the southwest of Melbourne, to prospectively predict the location of human BU cases in that region. As for the Mornington Peninsula, the excreta-based BU prediction model outperformed the null model (AUC 0.75 vs 0.50) and pinpointed specific locations in Geelong where interventions could be deployed to interrupt disease spread.Conclusions: This study highlights the One Health nature of BU by confirming a quantitative relationship between possum excreta shedding of M. ulcerans and humans developing BU. The excreta survey-informed modeling we have described will be a powerful tool for the efficient targeting of public health responses to stop BU.

TI  - Predicting satellite-derived patterns of large-scale disturbances in forests of the Pacific Northwest Region in response to recent climatic variation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Across the Pacific Northwest, the climate between 1950 and 1975 was exceptionally cool and wet compared with more recent conditions (1995-2005). We reasoned that the changes in climate could result in expanded outbreaks of insects, diseases, and fire. To test this premise, we first modeled monthly variation in photosynthesis and growth of the most widely distributed species, Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), using a process-based model (3-PG) for the two periods. To compare with remotely sensed variables, we converted modeled growth potential into maximum leaf area index (LAImax), which was predicted to range from 1 to 9 across the region. On most sites, varying soil moisture storage capacity (theta cap) from 200 to 300 mm while holding soil fertility constant, made slight but insignificant difference in simulated LAImax patterns. Both values of theta cap correlated well with LAI estimates acquired from NASA's MODIS satellites in June, 2005 (r(2)=0.7). To evaluate where 15 coniferous tree species might be prone to wide-scale disturbance, we used climatically-driven decision-tree models, calibrated in the 1950-1975 period, to identify vulnerable areas in 1995-2005. We stratified predictions within 34 recognized ecoregions and compared these results with large-scale disturbances recorded on MODIS imagery acquired between 2005 and 2009. The correlation between the percent of species judged as vulnerable within each ecoregion and the percent of forested areas recorded as disturbed with a MODIS-derived Global Disturbance Index was linear and accounted for 65 to 73% of the observed variation, depending on whether or not disturbance by fire was excluded from the analysis. Based on climate projections through the rest of the rest of the 21st century, we expect continued high levels of disturbance in ecoregions located beyond the climatically buffering influence of the Pacific Ocean.

TI  - Association between land cover and habitat productivity of malaria vectors in western Kenyan highlands
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - We examined the effects of land cover type oil survivorship and productivity of Anopheles gambiae in Kakamega in the western Kenyan highlands (elevation = 1,420-1.580 meters above sea level). Under natural conditions, An. gambiae sensu lato adults emerged only from farmland habitats, with all estimated productivity of 1.82 mosquitoes/meter(2)/week, but not from forest and swamp habitats. To determine the effects of intraspecific competition and land cover types, semi-natural larval habitats were created within three land cover types (farmland, forest, and natural swamp), and three different densities of An. gambiae sensu stricto larvae were introduced to the larval habitats. The mosquito pupation rate in farmland habitats was significantly greater than in swamp and forest habitats, and larval-to-pupal development times were significantly shorter. At higher densities, the larvae responded to increased intraspecific competition by extending their development time and emerging as smaller adults, but initial larval density showed no significant effects on pupation rate. Land cover type may affect larval survivorship and adult productivity through its effects on water temperature and nutrients in the aquatic habitats. as shown by the significantly higher water temperature in farmland habitats, enhanced pupation rates and shortened development times front the addition of food to habitats, and a significant negative correlation of the occurrence of An. gambiae larvae with canopy cover and emergent plants in natural habitats. These results suggest that deforestation and cultivation of natural swamps in the western Kenyan highland create conditions favorable for the survival of An. gambiae larvae, and consequently increase the risks of malaria transmission to the human population.

TI  - Simian Immunodeficiency Virus seroreactivity in inhabitants from rural Cameroon frequently in contact with non-human primates
T2  - VIROLOGY
AB  - Central African tropical forests are home to several species of non-human primates (NHPs), infected by Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SW). It is well-known that HIV-1 epidemic is due to cross-transmission and adaptation of SW to humans. The main goal of this work was to investigate if a NHP bite is a risk factor for SW acquisition. A cross-sectional study was performed in rural Cameroon on 246 bitten individuals (mostly by adult NHPs), matched, according to sex, age, and ethnicity (Bantus and Pygmies), with an equal number of not bitten subjects. Following a serological assay for a wide range of SIVs, we observed a high level of indeterminate seroreactivity (25.8%) in the total population, whereas 68.9% were sero-negative and 5.3% HIV-1 positive. Bites do not appear to be a risk factor for SW seroreactivity, in contrast to Simian Foamy Virus and Simian T-Lymphotropic Virus type 1 in the same studied population.

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Diversity Variation in the<i> Anopheles</i> Communities in Malaria-Endemic Regions of Colombia
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - This study aimed to evaluate at a temporospatial scale, the influence of anthropogenic land cover changes in the Anopheles species community composition and diversity in two Colombian malaria-endemic regions, Bajo Cauca and Pacific. To determine variations over time, mosquitoes were collected in two time periods; land cover types were characterized on orthorectified aerial photographs, and landscape metrics were estimated for each locality and period. A temporal dissimilarity analysis to evaluated species replacement and the nestedness species loss/gain showed the influence of the species loss or gain component on Anopheles species assemblage (23%). The relationship between land cover variation and Anopheles beta diversity, evaluated by regression analysis, showed the effect of forest variation in the Anopheles community (Bsim and forest r2 = 0.9323; Bsne and forest r2 = 0.9425). Furthermore, a canonical corre-spondence analysis showed that the land cover types associated with Anopheles species presence were bare soil, shrub, wet areas, and forest. Results demonstrated the impact of land cover changes attributed to human activities on Anopheles population dynamics, over time; this was evidenced as species loss or gain, which was specific to each local-ity. Notably, the main malaria vectors were dominant in most localities over time, suggesting their tolerance to anthropo-genic transformations; alternatively, the environmental changes are providing adequate ecological conditions for their persistence. Finally, the data generated are relevant for understanding the impact that environmental change may have on the dynamics of the neotropical malaria vectors. Thus, this research has potential implications for vector control interventions.

TI  - Bird habitat preferences drive hemoparasite infection in the Neotropical region
T2  - INTEGRATIVE ZOOLOGY
AB  - The role that the environment plays in vector-borne parasite infection is one of the central factors for understanding disease dynamics. We assessed how Neotropical bird foraging strata and habitat preferences determine infection by parasites of the genera Haemoproteus, Plasmodium, Leucocytozoon, and Trypanosoma and filarioids, and tested for phylogenetic signal in these host-parasite associations. We performed extensive searches of the scientific literature and created a database of hemoparasite surveys. We collected data on host body mass, foraging strata, habitat preference, and migratory status, and tested if host ecological traits predict each hemoparasite occurrence and prevalence using a phylogenetic Bayesian framework. Species of Plasmodium tend to infect birds from tropical forests while birds from altitudinal environments are likely to be infected by species of Leucocytozoon. The probability of a bird being infected by filarioid or Trypanosoma is higher in lowland forests. Bird species that occur in anthropic environments and dry habitats of tropical latitudes are more susceptible to infection by species of Haemoproteus. Host foraging strata is also influential and bird species that forage in the mid-high and canopy strata are more prone to infection by species of Haemoproteus and filarioids. We also identified phylogenetic signal for host-parasite associations with the probability of infection of Neotropical birds by any hemoparasite being more similar among more closely related species. We provided a useful framework to identify environments that correlate with hemoparasite infection, which is also helpful for detecting areas with potential suitability for hemoparasite infection due to land conversion and climate change.

TI  - Optimized rule-based logistic model tree algorithm for mapping mangrove species using ALOS PALSAR imagery and GIS in the tropical region
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
AB  - The main objective of this study is to map the spatial distribution of mangrove species and assess their changes from 2010 to 2015 in Hai Phong City of Vietnam located on the tropical region using the ALOS PALSAR data and an optimized rulebased decision tree technique. For this purpose, ALOS PALSAR imagery for the above period and GIS data were collected and used, and then, spatial distributions of mangrove species were derived using logistic model tree (LMT) classifier. The LMT is current state-of-the-art machine learning method that has not been used for mapping of mangrove species. The results showed that incorporation of ALOS PALSAR imagery and GIS in the LMT algorithm provides satisfactory overall accuracy and kappa coefficient. The ALOS-2 PALSAR for 2015 achieved better overall accuracy, with an increment of 3.6% in mapping mangrove species than that of the ALOS PALSAR for 2010. The ALOS-2 PALSAR-derived model yielded the overall accuracy of 83.8% and the kappa coefficient of 0.81, compared with those of the ALOS PALSAR-derived model, 80.2% and 0.78, respectively. The results of classification for 2010 and 2015 were significantly different using the McNemar test. This research demonstrates the potential use of ALOS PALSAR together with machine learning techniques in monitoring mangrove species in tropical areas.

TI  - Recent expansion of oil palm plantation in the most eastern part of Indonesia: feature extraction with polarimetric SAR
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Tropical forest is important in tackling global climate change. However, large-scale transformation of tropical forest in Indonesia is being done for oil palm plantation. Till date, there is a lack of scientific documentation that shows the most recent situation of oil palm plantation in the most eastern part of the country. This study documents the real condition of oil palm plantation expansion based on Sentinel data of European Space Agency (ESA). Sentinel-1 data sets of Papua Provinces of the year 2017 acquisition are used to avoid cloud cover problems in tropical regions. Object-based geospatial data feature extraction with Polarimetric SAR compared to the multiple classifier methods (that is, Gaussian Mixture Method, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and K-Nearest Neighbors) were introduced and employed using GRASS & QGIS of free open source software (FOSS). Google Earth Engine (GEE) was then used to verify the classification result of oil palm plantation. The preprocessing step is very crucial in achieving high accuracy. However, it is time-consuming. This study concluded that the proposed method and SVM classifiers achieved the highest accuracy, 99.7% and 99.12%, respectively. While the KNN, RF, and GMM classifier produced 94.63%, 89.06%, and 72.87%, respectively. We found that vast scale transformation of tropical rainforest in lowland areas is happening in eastern Indonesia. This situation should be strictly monitored and controlled to avoid more significant issues related to socio-economic-environmental implications.

TI  - Incorporating the disease triangle framework for testing the effect of soil-borne pathogens on tree species diversity
T2  - FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY
AB  - 1. The enemy-induced Janzen-Connell ( JC) effect, a classic model invoking conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD) and distance dependence, is a primary biodiversity maintenance hypothesis. Yet, conflicting evidence for the JC effect leads to disagreement about its role in maintaining forest diversity.
   2. We focus this review on soil-borne pathogens, which are the primary agent inducing the JC effect in many forest ecosystems. Although the test of the pathogeninduced JC effect in ecology critically rests on the seedling mortality caused by soil pathogens, what has not been explicitly explored in the early literature but has increasingly received attention is the long-recognized fact that the environment can alter virulence of pathogens and host susceptibility (thus pathogen-host interactions), as predicted by the classic disease triangle framework enlightened by pathology research in agricultural systems.
   3. Here, following the disease triangle framework we review evidence on how the pathogen-induced JC effect may be contingent on context (e.g. environmental conditions, pathogen inoculum load and genetic divergence in host and pathogen populations). The reviewed evidence reveals and clarifies the conditions where pathogens may or may not cause disease to hosts, thus contributing to reconciling the inconsistent results about the pathogen-induced JC effect in the literature. The context dependence of the disease triangle predicts that the pathogen-induced JC effect would change under global change.
   4. Gaining insights from evidence that the pathogen-induced JC effect is context-dependent, we suggest that future tests on the JC hypothesis be conducted under the framework of disease triangle, and we stress the necessity by controlling the effect of context factors on plant-pathogen interactions when testing for the JC effect. We conclude the review by proposing three lines of future research for testing the importance of the JC effect in maintaining global forest tree species diversity, with a particular emphasis on testing the effect of global warming on the strength of pathogen-host interactions for better predicting changes of forest biodiversity under climate change.

TI  - Asymptomatic <i>Plasmodium</i> infection in a residual malaria transmission area in the Atlantic Forest region: Implications for elimination
T2  - REVISTA DA SOCIEDADE BRASILEIRA DE MEDICINA TROPICAL
AB  - Introduction: Elimination of malaria in areas of interrupted transmission warrants careful case assessment to avoid the reintroduction of this disease. Occasional malaria cases are reported among visitors of the Atlantic Forest area of Brazil, while data on residents of this area are scarce. Methods: A sectional study was carried out to examine 324 individuals living in a municipality where autochthonous cases were detected. Results: Asymptomatic Plasmodium infections were detected in 2.8% of the individuals by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), with one case of P. falciparum (0.3%), two cases of P. vivax (0.6%), and six cases of P. malariae (1.9%). The thick blood smears were negative in all individuals. Serological tests performed in 314 subjects were reactive in 11.1%, with 3.5% for P. falciparum and 7.7% for R. vivax. A subsample of 42 reactive individuals for any Plasmodium species showed R. malariae in 30.9% of specimens. Individuals who entered the Atlantic Forest region were 2.7 times more likely to exhibit reactive serology for P. vivax compared with individuals who did not enter this region (p<0.05). Children <15 years had a higher chance of reactive serology for P. falciparum and P. vivax than individuals >= 15 years of age (p<0.05). Individuals living in the Paraiso district had a higher chance of reactive serology for P. vivax compared to other districts (p<0.05). No associations were found between sex, past exposure to malaria, or serological response to antibodies of any Plasmodium species. Conclusions: The implications of these results for the elimination of malaria were discussed.

TI  - EXPLOITATION OF <i>Erythrina dominguezii</i> Hassl. (Fabaceae) NECTAR BY PERCHING BIRDS IN A DRY FOREST IN WESTERN BRAZIL
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY
AB  - Among the vertebrate pollinated plants, the genus Erythrina includes tree species in which birds are the pollen vectors. Two groups in this genus may be distinguished: a) the hummingbird, and b) the perching bird pollinated species. Erythrina dominguezii is included in the second group and occurs in deciduous/semi-deciduous forests in the southwestern neotropics. I studied the exploitation of Erythrina dominguezii nectar by perching birds in a dry forest in western Brazil. Six perching bird species from two distinct groups (Psittacidae: Brotogeris chiriri, Nandayus nenday, Aratinga acuticaudata; Icterinae: Psarocolius decumanus, Icterus cayanensis, I. icterus) consumed its nectar. The two most important consumers were Brotogeris chiriri (51.5% of the flowers visited by birds) and Psarocolius decumanus (20%). While B. chiriri was a flower predator, P. decumanus removed the nectar without damaging the flowers which it opened by inserting its large bill between the standard and the keel. Nandayus nenday, Aratinga acuticaudata, and I. icterus exploited the nectar like P. decumanus, and presumably also contributed to pollen transfer. As the flowering in E. dominguezii was intense and synchronous during the dryest period of the year, and its nectar was highly consumed by birds, the present data suggest that the nectar of this species may be important as an alternative resource to frugivorous/omnivorous birds when other resources are scarce.

TI  - Land cover mapping of the Mekong Delta to support natural resource management with multi-temporal Sentinel-1A synthetic aperture radar imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has great potential for land cover mapping, especially in tropical regions, where frequent cloud cover obstructs optical remote sensing. The aim of this study is to demonstrate the utility of Sentinel-1A SAR imagery for characterising land use and land cover (LULC) in Bac Lieu, a rapidly developing province of the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, to support natural resource management for land use planning and monitoring. Twenty-one SAR images acquired in 2016 were classified in a four-step process. Firstly, the SAR images were pre-processed to produce Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) texture images. Then, to reduce the effects of rainfall variation confounding the classification, the images were divided into two categories: dry season (Jan-April) and wet season (May-December) and three input image sets were produced: 1) a single-date composite image (two VV-VH bands), 2) a multi-temporal composite image (eight bands for dry season and sixteen bands for wet season) and 3) a multi-temporal and textural composite image (sixteen bands for dry season and thirty two bands for wet season). We then applied Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) classifiers to characterise urban, forest, aquaculture, and rice paddy field for the three input image sets. We tested a combination of input images and classification algorithms and found that no matter the classification algorithms used, multi-temporal images had a higher overall classification accuracy than single-date images and that differences between classification algorithms were minimal. The most accurate classification resulted from a combination of the SVM classifier and multi-temporal and textural input image sets from the dry and wet seasons; with an overall accuracy of 94.81% and Kappa coefficient of 0.92. Our land cover mapping showed that Bac Lieu province is dominated by shrimp farming and rice paddy fields, with natural coastal forested ecosystems only made up a small proportion of the province. The results demonstrated the potential use of SAR as an up-to-date complementary data source of land cover information for local authorities, to support their land use master plan and to monitor illegal land use changes. Long-term monitoring of land use in Bac Lieu province, as well as in the Mekong Delta, will be crucial for decision makers, to ensure sustainability and food security in this region.

TI  - Pollination and breeding system of <i>Melochia tomentosa</i> L. (Malvaceae), a keystone floral resource in the Brazilian Caatinga
T2  - FLORA
AB  - The main goals of the present paper were to investigate the floral biology and the breeding system of Melochia tomentosa in a semi-arid region in Brazil., comparing the role of Apis mellifera with other native pollinators, and to discuss the importance of this plant species as a floral resource for the local fauna in maintaining different guilds of specialized pollinators in the Caatinga. M. tomentosa is very common in Caatinga areas and blooms year-round with two flowering peaks, one in the wet and another in the dry period. The pink, bright-colored flowers are distylous and both morphs are homogamous. The trichomatic nectary is located on the inner surface of the connate sepals, and the nectar (ca. 7 mu l) is accumulated in the space between the corolla and the calyx. Nectar sugar concentration reaches all average of 28%. The results of controlled pollination experiments show that M. tomentosa is self-incompatible. Pollen viability varies from 94% to 98%. spite of being visited by several pollen vectors, flower attributes of M. tomentosa point to melittophily, and A. mellifera was the most frequent visitor and the principal pollinator. Although honeybees are exotic, severely competing with native pollinators, they are important together with other native bees, like Centris and Xylocopa species, for the fruit set of M. tomentosa. This species represents a keystone floral resource favoring the maintenance of many species of bees, butterflies and hummingbirds through the year in this deciduous tropical dry forest.

TI  - Evolution and Conservation of Central African Biodiversity: Priorities for Future Research and Education in the Congo Basin and Gulf of Guinea
T2  - BIOTROPICA
AB  - The tropical forests of the Congo Basin and Gulf of Guinea harbor some of the greatest terrestrial and aquatic biological diversity in the world. However, our knowledge of the rich biological diversity of this region and the evolutionary processes that have shaped it remains limited, as is our understanding of the capacity for species to adapt or otherwise respond to current and projected environmental change. In this regard, research efforts are needed to increase current scientific knowledge of this region's biodiversity, identify the drivers of past diversification, evaluate the potential for species to adapt to environmental change and identify key populations for future conservation. Moreover, when evolutionary research is combined with ongoing environmental monitoring efforts, it can also provide an important set of tools for assessing and mitigating the impacts of development activities. Building on a set of recommendations developed at an international workshop held in Gabon in 2011, we highlight major areas for future evolutionary research that could be directly tied to conservation priorities for the region. These research priorities are centered around five disciplinary themes: (1) documenting and discovering biodiversity; (2) identifying drivers of evolutionary diversification; (3) monitoring environmental change; (4) understanding community and ecosystem level processes; (5) investigating the ecology and epidemiology of disease from an evolutionary perspective (evolutionary epidemiology). Furthermore, we also provide an overview of the needs and priorities for biodiversity education and training in Central Africa.
   Resume Les forets tropicales du bassin du Congo et du Golfe de Guinee abritent une grande partie de la diversite terrestre et aquatique dans le monde. Pourtant, notre connaissance de la riche diversite biologique de cette region et les processus evolutifs qui l'ont faconnee demeurent encore peu compris, tout comme notre comprehension de la capacite des especes a s'adapter ou a repondre aux changements environnementaux actuels et a venir. De ce fait, des efforts de recherche sont necessaires pour ameliorer les connaissances scientifiques actuelles sur la biodiversite de cette region, determiner les causes des processus de diversifications passees, evaluer le potentiel des especes a repondre aux changements environnementaux et identifier les populations cles pour la conservation dans le futur. Par ailleurs, lorsque la recherche dans le domaine de l'evolution est combinee aux efforts de suivi continu de l'environnement, elle peut aussi fournir un ensemble d'outils importants pour l'evaluation et l'attenuation des impacts des activites de developpement. S'appuyant sur une serie de recommandations elaborees lors de l'atelier international qui s'est tenu au Gabon en 2011, nous soulignons les axes majeurs pour la recherche future dans le domaine de l'evolution qui pourraient etre lies directement aux priorites de la conservation dans la region. Ces priorites de recherche s'articulent autour de cinq thematiques: (1) l'inventaire et la decouverte de la biodiversite; (2) l'identification des causes de la diversification; (3) le suivi des changements environnementaux; (4) la comprehension des processus au niveau des communautes et des ecosystemes; (5) l'etude ecologique et epidemiologique des maladies d'un point de vue evolutif (epidemiologie evolutive). Toutefois, nous donnons egalement un apercu des besoins et des priorites en matiere d'education et de formation dans le domaine de la biodiversite en Afrique centrale.

TI  - Troop education and avian influenza surveillance in military barracks in Ghana, 2011
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Background: Influenza A viruses that cause highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) also infect humans. In many developing countries such as Ghana, poultry and humans live in close proximity in both the general and military populations, increasing risk for the spread of HPAI from birds to humans. Respiratory infections such as influenza are especially prone to rapid spread among military populations living in close quarters such as barracks making this a key population for targeted avian influenza surveillance and public health education.
   Method: Twelve military barracks situated in the coastal, tropical rain forest and northern savannah belts of the country were visited and the troops and their families educated on pandemic avian influenza. Attendants at each site was obtained from the attendance sheet provided for registration. The seminars focused on zoonotic diseases, influenza surveillance, pathogenesis of avian influenza, prevention of emerging infections and biosecurity. To help direct public health policies, a questionnaire was used to collect information on animal populations and handling practices from 102 households in the military barracks. Cloacal and tracheal samples were taken from 680 domestic and domesticated wild birds and analysed for influenza A using molecular methods for virus detection.
   Results: Of the 1028 participants that took part in the seminars, 668 (65%) showed good knowledge of pandemic avian influenza and the risks associated with its infection. Even though no evidence of the presence of avian influenza (AI) infection was found in the 680 domestic and wild birds sampled, biosecurity in the households surveyed was very poor.
   Conclusion: Active surveillance revealed that there was no AI circulation in the military barracks in April 2011. Though participants demonstrated good knowledge of pandemic avian influenza, biosecurity practices were minimal. Sustained educational programs are needed to further strengthen avian influenza surveillance and prevention in military barracks.

TI  - Biodiversity in tropical agroforests and the ecological role of ants and ant diversity in predatory function
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - 1. Intensive agricultural practices drive biodiversity loss with potentially drastic consequences for ecosystem services. To advance conservation and production goals, agricultural practices should be compatible with biodiversity. Traditional or less intensive systems (i.e. with fewer agrochemicals, less mechanisation, more crop species) such as shaded coffee and cacao agroforests are highlighted for their ability to provide a refuge for biodiversity and may also enhance certain ecosystem functions (i.e. predation).
   2. Ants are an important predator group in tropical agroforestry systems. Generally, ant biodiversity declines with coffee and cacao intensification yet the literature lacks a summary of the known mechanisms for ant declines and how this diversity loss may affect the role of ants as predators.
   3. Here, how shaded coffee and cacao agroforestry systems protect biodiversity and may preserve related ecosystem functions is discussed in the context of ants as predators. Specifically, the relationships between biodiversity and predation, links between agriculture and conservation, patterns and mechanisms for ant diversity loss with agricultural intensification, importance of ants as control agents of pests and fungal diseases, and whether ant diversity may influence the functional role of ants as predators are addressed. Furthermore, because of the importance of homopteran-tending by ants in the ecological and agricultural literature, as well as to the success of ants as predators, the costs and benefits of promoting ants in agroforests are discussed.
   4. Especially where the diversity of ants and other predators is high, as in traditional agroforestry systems, both agroecosystem function and conservation goals will be advanced by biodiversity protection.

TI  - Hybrid artificial intelligence approach based on neural fuzzy inference model and metaheuristic optimization for flood susceptibilitgy modeling in a high-frequency tropical cyclone area using GIS
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
AB  - This paper proposes a new artificial intelligence approach based on neural fuzzy inference system and metaheuristic optimization for flood susceptibility modeling, namely MONF. In the new approach, the neural fuzzy inference system was used to create an initial flood susceptibility model and then the model was optimized using two metaheuristic algorithms, Evolutionary Genetic and Particle Swarm Optimization. A high-frequency tropical cyclone area of the Tuong Duong district in Central Vietnam was used as a case study. First, a GIS database for the study area was constructed. The database that includes 76 historical flood inundated areas and ten flood influencing factors was used to develop and validate the proposed model. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, and area under the ROC curve (AUC) were used to assess the model performance and its prediction capability. Experimental results showed that the proposed model has high performance on both the training (RMSE = 0.306, MAE = 0.094, AUC = 0.962) and validation dataset (RMSE = 0.362, MAE = 0.130, AUC = 0.911). The usability of the proposed model was evaluated by comparing with those obtained from state-of-the art benchmark soft computing techniques such as J48 Decision Tree, Random Forest, Multi-layer Perceptron Neural Network, Support Vector Machine, and Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System. The results show that the proposed MONF model outperforms the above benchmark models; we conclude that the MONF model is a new alternative tool that should be used in flood susceptibility mapping. The result in this study is useful for planners and decision makers for sustainable management of flood-prone areas. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Effects of mammal defaunation on natural ecosystem services and human well being throughout the entire Neotropical realm
T2  - ECOSYSTEM SERVICES
AB  - Mammals embody the apex of ecosystems processes, and their majestic diversity is overwhelmingly threatened in the Neotropical realm. Mammal population declines erode not only several levels of biological diversity, but may also impoverish critical ecosystem services (ES). Based on 2,427 putative baseline mammal assemblages derived from IUCN ranges polygons, we sought to understand, for the first time, the effects of mammal defaunation on natural ecosystem services throughout the entire Neotropical realm. At the assemblage-level, we simulated both stochastic and deterministic regimes of mammal defaunation, examining both diversity indices and classic metrics of ecological networks (e.g. modularity and nestedness). Our results show that ES losses are induced by declines in both taxonomic and functional diversity. Given any defaunation regime, Neotropical provinces undergo levels of ES erosion typically reaching less than a third of all potential network links. Geographic patterns of lost ecosystem services-resulting from simulated and real-world mammal extinctions-indicate that this will detrimentally affect human livelihoods across all major Neotropical provinces. We conclude that the ongoing defaunation process will promote irreversible failures of several mammal-mediated ecosystem processes at varying timescales.

TI  - Fine-scale landscape genomics helps explain the slow spatial spread of <i>Wolbachia</i> through the <i>Aedes aegypti</i> population in Cairns, Australia
T2  - HEREDITY
AB  - The endosymbiotic bacterium Wolbachia suppresses the capacity for arbovirus transmission in the mosquito Aedes aegypti, and can spread spatially through wild mosquito populations following local introductions. Recent introductions in Cairns, Australia have demonstrated slower than expected spatial spread. Potential reasons for this include: (i) barriers to Ae. aegypti dispersal; (ii) higher incidence of long-range dispersal; and (iii) intergenerational loss of Wolbachia. We investigated these three potential factors using genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and an assay for the Wolbachia infection wMel in 161 Ae. aegypti collected from Cairns in 2015. We detected a small but significant barrier effect of Cairns highways on Ae. aegypti dispersal using distance-based redundancy analysis and patch-based simulation analysis. We detected a pair of putative full-siblings in ovitraps 1312 m apart, indicating long-distance female movement likely mediated by human transport. We also found a pair of full-siblings of different infection status, indicating intergenerational loss of Wolbachia in the field. These three factors are all expected to contribute to the slow spread of Wolbachia through Ae. aegypti populations, though from our results it is unclear whether Wolbachia loss and long-distance movement are sufficiently common to reduce the speed of spatial spread appreciably. Our findings inform the strategic deployment of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes during releases, and show how parameter estimates from laboratory studies may differ from those estimated using field data. Our landscape genomics approach can be extended to other host/symbiont systems that are being considered for biocontrol.

TI  - Differential attraction of drosophilids to banana baits inoculated with <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> and <i>Hanseniaspora</i> <i>uvarum</i> within a Neotropical forest remnant
T2  - PEERJ
AB  - Background. Yeasts are a necessary requisite in the diet of most Drosophila species that, in turn, may vector their dispersal in natural environments. Differential attractiveness experiments and the isolation of yeasts consumed by Drosophila may be informative for characterizing this association. Hanseniaspora uvarum is among the most common yeast species isolated from Drosophila crops, with high attractiveness to drosophilids. Saccharorrtyces cerevisiae has been widely used to collect flies, and it allows broad sampling of almost. all local Drosophila species. Pronounced differences in the field concerning Drosophila attractivity to baits seeded with these yeast species have been previously reported. However, few explicit generalizations have. been. set. Since late fifties, no field experiments of. Drosophila attractivity were carried out. in.the Neotropical region, which is facing shifts in abiotic and biotic factors.. Our objective is to characterize preference behavior that mediates the interaction in the wild among Neotropical Drosophila species and yeasts associated with them. We want to set a broad generalization about drosophilids attracted to the se yeasts. Here we present the results of a differential attractiveness experiment we carried out in a natural Atlantic Rainforest fragment to assess the preferences of Drosophila species groups to baits inoculated with H. uvarum and S. cerevisiae.
   Methods. Both yeast species were cultured in GYMP broth and separately poured in autoclaved mashed banana that was left fermenting. In the field, we collected drosophilids over five arrays of three different baits: non-inoculated autoclaved banana and banana inoculated with each yeast. In the laboratory the drosophilids were sorted to five sets according to their external morphology and/or genitalia: tripunctata; guarani; exotic; and the remaining flies pooled in others.
   Results and Conclusions. Uninoculated banana baits attracted virtually no flies. We found significant departures from random distribution over the other two baits (1:1 proportion) for all sets, except the pooled others. Flies of the sets willistoni and exotic preferred H. uvarum over S. cerevisiae, while the remaining sets were more attracted to S. cerevisiae. Previously various authors reported similar patterns in attraction experiments with S. cerevisiae and H. uvarum. It is also noteworthy that both yeast species have been isolated from natural substrates and crops of Drosophila species. Taken together, these results suggest that the preferences among Drosophila species groups may be reflecting deep and stable relations with yeast species in natural environments. They can be summarized as: forest dwelling species from subgenus Drosophila (such as tripunctata and guarani groups) are attracted to banana baits seeded with S. cerevisiae; while exotic (as D. melanogaster) and subgenus Sophophora species are preferentially attracted to baits seeded with H. uvarum.

TI  - Uncovering the Pathogenic Landscape of Helminth (<i>Opisthorchis viverrini</i>) Infections: A Cross-Sectional Study on Contributions of Physical and Social Environment and Healthcare Interventions
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   Helminth infections have proven recalcitrant to control by chemotherapy in many parts of Southeast Asia and indeed farther afield. This study isolates and examines the influence of different aspects of the physical and social environment, and uneven intervention effort contributing to the pathogenic landscape of human Opisthorchis viverrini infections.
   Methodology
   A cross-sectional survey, involving 632 participants, was conducted in four villages in northeast Thailand to examine the impact on prevalence and parasite burden of the reservoir dam environment, socio-economic, demographic, and behavioral factors, and health center intervention efforts. Formalin-ether concentration technique was used for diagnoses, and multivariate models were used for analyses.
   Principal Findings
   The importance attributed to O. viverrini infections varied among health centers in the four study villages. Villages where O. viverrini infections were not prioritized by the health centers as the healthcare focus were at a higher risk of infection (prevalence) with odds ratio (risk factor) of 5.73 (3.32-10.27) and p-value < 0.01. Priority of healthcare focus, however, did not appear to influence behavior, as the consumption of raw fish, the main source of O. viverrini infections in the study area, was 11.4% higher in villages that prioritized O. viverrini infections than those that did not (p-value = 0.01). Landscape variation, notably proximity to reservoir, affects vulnerability of local population to infection. Infection intensity was higher in population located closer to the reservoir with risk ratio of 2.09 (1.12-4.02) and p-value < 0.01. Patterns of infection intensities among humans were found to match fish infection intensity, where higher infection intensities were associated with fish obtained from the reservoir waterbody type (p-value = 0.023).
   Conclusions/Significance
   This study demonstrated the importance of environmental influence and healthcare focus as risk factors of infections in addition to the socio-economic, demographic, and behavioral factors commonly explored in existing studies. The reservoir was identified as a crucial source to target for opisthorchiasis intervention efforts and the need to consider infection intensity in disease control efforts was highlighted. The holistic approach in this study, which underscores the close relationship between the environment, animals, and humans in development of human infections or diseases, is an important contribution to the framework of One Health approach, where consideration of helminth diseases has largely been overlooked.

TI  - Variation in the composition and structure of tropical savannas as a function of rainfall and soil texture along a large-scale climatic gradient in the Northern Territory, Australia
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY
AB  - Variation in structural and compositional attributes of tropical savannas are described in relation to variation in annual rainfall and soil texture along a subcontinental-scale gradient of rainfall in the wet-dry tropics of the Northern Territory, Australia. Rainfall varies along the gradient from over 1500 mm p.a. in the Darwin region (c. 12 degrees S) to less than 500 mm in the Tennant Creek region (c. 18 degrees S). Soils are patchy, and sands, loams and clays may occur in all major districts within the region. We utilized a large data set (1657 quadratsx291 woody species; with numerous measured and derived sample variables) covering an area of 0.5 million km(2). Correlations between floristic composition of woody species and environmental variables were assessed using DCA ordination and vector fitting of environmental variables. Vectors of annual rainfall and soil texture were highly correlated with variation in species composition. Multiple regression analyses incorporating linear and quadratic components of mean annual rainfall and topsoil clay content were performed on three structural attributes (tree height, tree cover, tree basal area), and two compositional attributes (woody species richness, deciduous tree species richness). Tree height declined with decreasing rainfall; cover, basal area, woody species richness and deciduous species richness ail declined with decreasing rainfall and increasing soil clay content. Regression models accounted for between 17% and 45% of the variation in the data sets. Variation in other factors such as soil depth, landscape position and recent land-use practices (for which there were no data on an individual quadrat basis) are likely to have contributed to the large residual variation in the data set.

TI  - How do disease control measures impact spatial predictions of schistosomiasis and hookworm? The example of predicting school-based prevalence before and after preventive chemotherapy in Ghana
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - BackgroundSchistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminth infections are among the neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) affecting primarily marginalized communities in low- and middle-income countries. Surveillance data for NTDs are typically sparse, and hence, geospatial predictive modeling based on remotely sensed (RS) environmental data is widely used to characterize disease transmission and treatment needs. However, as large-scale preventive chemotherapy has become a widespread practice, resulting in reduced prevalence and intensity of infection, the validity and relevance of these models should be re-assessed. MethodologyWe employed two nationally representative school-based prevalence surveys of Schistosoma haematobium and hookworm infections from Ghana conducted before (2008) and after (2015) the introduction of large-scale preventive chemotherapy. We derived environmental variables from fine-resolution RS data (Landsat 8) and examined a variable distance radius (1-5 km) for aggregating these variables around point-prevalence locations in a non-parametric random forest modeling approach. We used partial dependence and individual conditional expectation plots to improve interpretability. Principal findingsThe average school-level S. haematobium prevalence decreased from 23.8% to 3.6% and that of hookworm from 8.6% to 3.1% between 2008 and 2015. However, hotspots of high-prevalence locations persisted for both diseases. The models with environmental data extracted from a buffer radius of 2-3 km around the school location where prevalence was measured had the best performance. Model performance (according to the R-2 value) was already low and declined further from approximately 0.4 in 2008 to 0.1 in 2015 for S. haematobium and from approximately 0.3 to 0.2 for hookworm. According to the 2008 models, land surface temperature (LST), modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI), elevation, slope, and streams variables were associated with S. haematobium prevalence. LST, slope, and improved water coverage were associated with hookworm prevalence. Associations with the environment in 2015 could not be evaluated due to low model performance. Conclusions/significanceOur study showed that in the era of preventive chemotherapy, associations between S. haematobium and hookworm infections and the environment weakened, and thus predictive power of environmental models declined. In light of these observations, it is timely to develop new cost-effective passive surveillance methods for NTDs as an alternative to costly surveys, and to focus on persisting hotspots of infection with additional interventions to reduce reinfection. We further question the broad application of RS-based modeling for environmental diseases for which large-scale pharmaceutical interventions are in place.
   Author summaryParasitic worm infections, such as schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminthiasis, belong to a group of diseases collectively known as neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) that affect primarily marginalized communities. Transmission of both parasitic worms is affected by behavioral, environmental, and socioeconomic factors. In the absence of reliable surveillance data, sophisticated geostatistical models that rely on environmental predictors are commonly used to predict transmission and treatment needs. We used two nationally representative surveys conducted in Ghana and employed a relatively simple and interpretable modeling approach to predict the risk of Schistosoma haematobium and hookworm infections among school-age children before (2008) and after (2015) deworming became a widespread practice. We found that as the proportion of infected children declined, model performance decreased, but hotspots of high-prevalence locations persisted. This suggests that the models may still be useful in spatial targeting of interventions, but the broad application of the approach should be re-evaluated.

TI  - A systematic review of Ebola virus disease outbreaks and an analysis of the efficacy and safety of newer drugs approved for the treatment of Ebola virus disease by the US Food and Drug Administration from 2016 to 2020
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTION AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Background: The Ebola virus has started to infect humans from time to time since then and has led to several outbreaks. Due to urbanisation growth, invasion of forested areas, and close interaction with wildlife animals, the spread of the Ebola virus has caused the deadliest diseases to animals and humans. To date, the Ebola virus disease (EVD) claimed many lives of human beings and a greater number of cases were observed in the African region. Hence, a review was carried out to analyse the trends in EVD outbreaks, morbidity and mortality among EVD patients, efficacy and safety of drugs approved for the treatment of EVD.
   Method: The literature on EVD outbreaks, safety, and efficacy of EVD drugs were searched on Science Direct, PubMed, and Google Scholar using the MeSH terms such as Ebola, Ebola virus disease, Outbreak, Epidemic, Safety, Efficacy, for the period of 2016-2020. In addition to that. Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC), World Health Organization (WHO), US Food & Drug Administration, and UpToDate websites also searched for the latest reports, guidelines, approved drugs, etc.
   Results: There are only a few treatment options available for EVD to date, the most commonly used drugs for EVD are ZMapp, Inmazeb, and Ebanga. The review found that among these three drugs, ZMapp Plus is superior in the treatment of EVD with the current standard of care of 91.2%. INMAZEB when given at a 3 ml/ kg IV dose reduced the mortality rate by 17% in subjects with EVD. Ebanga has shown a mortality rate of 35.1% when given a 50 mg/kg single IV dose. The most observed adverse effects were fever, tachycardia, diarrhoea, vomiting, hypotension, tachypnea, and chills.
   Conclusion: Overall, Inmazeb is the preferred drug of choice over ZMapp or other drugs for the treatment of EVD, and Ebanga is a choice in patients with cardiovascular complications. In addition to that, supportive care is very essential to control the mortality rate. (C) 2022 The Author(s).

TI  - Temporal and spatial distribution of malaria within an agricultural settlement of the Brazilian Amazon
T2  - JOURNAL OF VECTOR ECOLOGY
AB  - Malaria has reemerged in tropical regions with rapid population growth and deforestation. The dynamics of malaria transmission in agricultural settlements of the Amazon have been poorly defined. We studied the spatial distribution of malaria incidence in Roraima, Brazil, using multi regression analysis on 12 parameters that described social, housing, and behavioral variables. Malaria cases were associated with the proximity of Anopheles darlingi breeding sites, the main vector in these areas. During the dry season, transmission was enhanced near a temporary river. Cases occurred throughout the year near fish-farming dams. Epidemiological models derived from urban or riverine malaria are probably inadequate for describing disease transmission in agricultural settlements, where cases are clustered near breeding sites, while the majority of the population remains unaffected. Identification of these areas, associated with residual insecticide spraying or surveillance, may considerably decrease the costs of control efforts. Journal of Vector Ecology 36 (1): 159-169. 2010.

TI  - Novel species of <i>Calonectria</i> isolated from soil near <i>Eucalyptus</i> plantations in southern China
T2  - MYCOLOGIA
AB  - Calonectria species are soil-borne and widely distributed in tropical and subtropical regions around the world. The species in this genus include many important plant pathogens that cause serious diseases to economically important crops and forest trees. Previous research results indicated that the leaf blight and cutting rot caused by Calonectria species caused big losses to the Eucalyptus industry in southern China, and large number of Calonectria species identified in China have been collected from soil in Eucalyptus plantations. In this study, Calonectria samples were isolated from soils close to Eucalyptus plantations in Guangdong Province, southern China. These isolates were identified by DNA sequence analyses based on the calmodulin (cmdA), histone H3 (his3), translation elongation factor 1-alpha (tef1), and ?-tubulin (tub2) gene regions, and combined with morphological characteristics. One novel species of Calonectria was identified and described, named Calonectria xianrensis, which resides in the Prolate Group. Results in this study suggest that more species of Calonectria may be distributed in soils in China.

TI  - Modelling the impact of ivermectin on River Blindness and its burden of morbidity and mortality in African Savannah: EpiOncho projections
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
AB  - Background: The African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control (APOC) has refocused its goals on the elimination of infection where possible, seemingly achievable by 15-17 years of annual mass distribution of ivermectin in some African foci. Previously, APOC had focused on the elimination of onchocerciasis as a public health problem. Timeframes have been set by the World Health Organization, the London Declaration on Neglected Tropical Diseases and the World Bank to achieve these goals by 2020-2025.
   Methods: A novel mathematical model of the dynamics of onchocercal disease is presented which links documented associations between Onchocerca volvulus infection and the prevalence and incidence of morbidity and mortality to model outputs from our host age-and sex-structured onchocerciasis transmission framework (EpiOncho). The model is calibrated for African savannah settings, and used to assess the impact of long-term annual mass administration of ivermectin on infection and ocular and skin disease and to explore how this depends on epidemiological and programmatic variables.
   Results: Current onchocerciasis disease projections, which do not account for excess mortality of sighted individuals with heavy microfilarial loads, underestimate disease burden. Long-term annual ivermectin treatment is highly effective at reducing both the morbidity and mortality associated with onchocerciasis, and this result is not greatly influenced by treatment coverage and compliance. By contrast, impact on microfilarial prevalence and intensity is highly dependent on baseline endemicity, treatment coverage and systematic non-compliance.
   Conclusions: The goals of eliminating morbidity and infection with ivermectin alone are distinctly influenced by epidemiological and programmatic factors. Whilst the former goal is most certainly achievable, reaching the latter will strongly depend on initial endemicity (the higher the endemicity, the greater the magnitude of inter-treatment transmission), advising caution when generalising the applicability of successful elimination outcomes to other areas. The proportion of systematic non-compliers will become far more influential in terms of overall success in achieving elimination goals.

TI  - Current and Future Niche of North and Central American Sand Flies (Diptera: Psychodidae) in Climate Change Scenarios
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Ecological niche models are useful tools to infer potential spatial and temporal distributions in vector species and to measure epidemiological risk for infectious diseases such as the Leishmaniases. The ecological niche of 28 North and Central American sand fly species, including those with epidemiological relevance, can be used to analyze the vector's ecology and its association with transmission risk, and plan integrated regional vector surveillance and control programs. In this study, we model the environmental requirements of the principal North and Central American phlebotomine species and analyze three niche characteristics over future climate change scenarios: i) potential change in niche breadth, ii) direction and magnitude of niche centroid shifts, iii) shifts in elevation range. Niche identity between confirmed or incriminated Leishmania vector sand flies in Mexico, and human cases were analyzed. Niche models were constructed using sand fly occurrence datapoints from Canada, USA, Mexico, Guatemala and Belize. Nine non-correlated bioclimatic and four topographic data layers were used as niche components using GARP in OpenModeller. Both B2 and A2 climate change scenarios were used with two general circulation models for each scenario (CSIRO and HadCM3), for 2020, 2050 and 2080. There was an increase in niche breadth to 2080 in both scenarios for all species with the exception of Lutzomyia vexator. The principal direction of niche centroid displacement was to the northwest (64%), while the elevation range decreased greatest for tropical, and least for broad-range species. Lutzomyia cruciata is the only epidemiologically important species with high niche identity with that of Leishmania spp. in Mexico. Continued landscape modification in future climate change will provide an increased opportunity for the geographic expansion of NCA sand flys' ENM and human exposure to vectors of Leishmaniases.

TI  - Adaptation and agronomic performance of <i>Artemisia annua</i> L. under lowland humid tropical conditions
T2  - INDUSTRIAL CROPS AND PRODUCTS
AB  - Demand for new chemotherapies against malaria is increasing as Plasmodium, the causative organism of the disease, has shown a high degree of resistance against most standard anti-malarial drugs. One of the few highly effective compounds is artemisinin, the major sesquiterpene for the production of artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs). This antimalarial drug is extracted from the leaves of Artemisia annua, a plant that is mainly cultivated under cool (temperate) climate and high altitudes. The current study examined the possibility of introducingA. annua germplasm into the agricultural landscape of the lowland humid tropics in field experiments and identified promising accessions that are capable of producing high leaf biomass and artemisinin yields. Differences amongst seed origin, planting season and soil moisture availability had highly significant (P<0.01) effects on most of the agronomic characteristics evaluated, suggesting that these are very critical factors when considering the cultivation of A. annua in the humid tropics. Two non-photoperiodic hybrid lines evaluated in the trials had suitable agronomic potential, including the production of fresh leaf biomass yield in excess of 30 tonnes/ha with up to 1.0975% artemisinin concentration. This study shows that with improved management practices and using the right accessions, there is an inspiring possibility that the cultivation of A. annua can be optimized in the humid tropics for commercial production of the life saving artemisinin drug, which is most needed in these regions where malaria is endemic.

TI  - Benchmarking Machine Learning Models to Assist in the Prognosis of Tuberculosis
T2  - INFORMATICS-BASEL
AB  - Tuberculosis (TB) is an airborne infectious disease caused by organisms in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) complex. In many low and middle-income countries, TB remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Once a patient has been diagnosed with TB, it is critical that healthcare workers make the most appropriate treatment decision given the individual conditions of the patient and the likely course of the disease based on medical experience. Depending on the prognosis, delayed or inappropriate treatment can result in unsatisfactory results including the exacerbation of clinical symptoms, poor quality of life, and increased risk of death. This work benchmarks machine learning models to aid TB prognosis using a Brazilian health database of confirmed cases and deaths related to TB in the State of Amazonas. The goal is to predict the probability of death by TB thus aiding the prognosis of TB and associated treatment decision making process. In its original form, the data set comprised 36,228 records and 130 fields but suffered from missing, incomplete, or incorrect data. Following data cleaning and preprocessing, a revised data set was generated comprising 24,015 records and 38 fields, including 22,876 reported cured TB patients and 1139 deaths by TB. To explore how the data imbalance impacts model performance, two controlled experiments were designed using (1) imbalanced and (2) balanced data sets. The best result is achieved by the Gradient Boosting (GB) model using the balanced data set to predict TB-mortality, and the ensemble model composed by the Random Forest (RF), GB and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) models is the best model to predict the cure class.

TI  - Analyzing the spatio-temporal relationship between dengue vector larval density and land-use using factor analysis and spatial ring mapping
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Background: Dengue, a mosquito-borne febrile viral disease, is found in tropical and sub-tropical regions and is now extending its range to temperate regions. The spread of the dengue viruses mainly depends on vector population (Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus), which is influenced by changing climatic conditions and various land-use/land-cover types. Spatial display of the relationship between dengue vector density and land-cover types is required to describe a near-future viral outbreak scenario. This study is aimed at exploring how land-cover types are linked to the behavior of dengue-transmitting mosquitoes.
   Methods: Surveys were conducted in 92 villages of Phitsanulok Province Thailand. The sampling was conducted on three separate occasions in the months of March, May and July. Dengue indices, i.e. container index (C.I.), house index (H.I.) and Breteau index (B.I.) were used to map habitats conducible to dengue vector growth. Spatial epidemiological analysis using Bivariate Pearson's correlation was conducted to evaluate the level of interdependence between larval density and land-use types. Factor analysis using principal component analysis (PCA) with varimax rotation was performed to ascertain the variance among land-use types. Furthermore, spatial ring method was used as to visualize spatially referenced, multivariate and temporal data in single information graphic.
   Results: Results of dengue indices showed that the settlements around gasoline stations/workshops, in the vicinity of marsh/swamp and rice paddy appeared to be favorable habitat for dengue vector propagation at highly significant and positive correlation (p = 0.001) in the month of May. Settlements around the institutional areas were highly significant and positively correlated (p = 0.01) with H.I. in the month of March. Moreover, dengue indices in the month of March showed a significant and positive correlation (p <= 0.05) with deciduous forest. The H.I. of people living around horticulture land were significantly and positively correlated (p = 0.05) during the month of May, and perennial vegetation showed a highly significant and positive correlation (p = 0.001) in the month of March with C.I. and significant and positive correlation (p <= 0.05) with B.I., respectively.
   Conclusions: The study concluded that gasoline stations/workshops, rice paddy, marsh/swamp and deciduous forests played highly significant role in dengue vector growth. Thus, the spatio-temporal relationships of dengue vector larval density and land-use types may help to predict favorable dengue habitat, and thereby enables public healthcare managers to take precautionary measures to prevent impending dengue outbreak.

TI  - Implementation of ensemble methods on QSAR Study of NS3 inhibitor activity as anti-dengue agent
T2  - SAR AND QSAR IN ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB  - Dengue fever is a disease transmitted by infected mosquitoes. This disease spreads in several countries, especially those with a tropical climate. To date, there is no specific drug that can be used to treat dengue. Use of clinically investigated drugs, such as Balapiravir, is still not effective in inhibiting the activity of virus replication. The design of a drug candidate can be performed by using the non-structural protein 3 (NS3) as target. This study aimed to develop QSAR models to predict the inhibitory activity class of NS3 inhibitors. The classification was performed by using feature importance analysis for selecting the descriptors and three ensemble methods, i.e. random forest (RF), adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), and extremely randomized trees (ERT), for model design and prediction. Hyperparameter tuning was performed to improve the performance of the models. Based on the results, we found that model 9, developed from ERT produced the best performance with values of accuracy and AUC equal to 0.73 and 0.82, respectively. Use of y-scrambling method allowed us to confirm that the model was not related to the chance correlation.

TI  - Microbial ecology and evolution is key to pandemics: using the coronavirus model to mitigate future public health challenges
T2  - HELIYON
AB  - Pandemics are global challenges that lead to total disruption of human activities. From the inception of human existence, all pandemics have resulted in loss of human lives. The coronavirus disease caused by SAR-CoV-2 began in China and is now at the global scale with an increase in mortality and morbidity. Numerous anthropogenic activities have been implicated in the emergence and severity of pandemics, including COVID-19. These activities cause changes in microbial ecology, leading to evolution due to mutation and recombination. This review hypothesized that an understanding of these anthropogenic activities would explain the dynamics of pandemics. The recent coronavirus model was used to study issues leading to microbial evolution, towards preventing future pandemics. Our review highlighted anthropogenic activities, including deforestation, mining activities, waste treatment, burning of fossil fuel, as well as international travels as drivers of microbial evolution leading to pandemics. Furthermore, human-animal interaction has also been implicated in pandemic incidents. Our study recommends substantial control of such anthropogenic activities as having been highlighted as ways to reduce the frequency of mutation, reduce pathogenic reservoirs, and the emergence of infectious diseases.

TI  - <i>Aedes albopictus</i> in urban and forested areas of Malaysia: A study of mitochondrial sequence variation using the <i>CO1</i> marker
T2  - TROPICAL BIOMEDICINE
AB  - This study explores the use of a long fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (CO1) marker to elucidate the genetic diversity of Aedes albopictus sampled from urban and forested regions in Peninsular and East Malaysia. A total of 36 samples were collected from 5 localities from which its genetic variability was analysed. 33 distinct mtDNA haplotypes were identified following the amplification and sequencing of the concatenated CO1 gene. The analysed region of the CO1 gene identified substantial levels of genetic diversity among mosquitoes in urban populations and revealed unique genealogical relationships between local isolates as revealed in the haplotype network. This study highlights the reliability of the long CO1 fragment to identify genetic divergence of Aedes albopictus which can be utilized in forthcoming studies.

TI  - Knowledge, Attitudes, Risk Perception, Preparedness and Vaccine Intent of Health Care Providers towards the Nipah Virus in South India
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE
AB  - Nipah virus (NiV) disease (NVD) remains a re-emerging public health threat in India. We assessed the knowledge, attitudes, and risk perception of NVD and future vaccine intent among a convenience sample of health care providers (HCP). The primary outcome measures were the knowledge, attitudes, and risk perception scores. Of 261 participants surveyed, 203 (77.8%) had heard of NiV and associated symptoms. The majority (248, 95%) identified the fruit bat as a primary NiV reservoir and 205 (79.8%) were aware of human-to-human transmission via droplets. Only 101 (38.7%) participants were aware that drinking date palm sap is a risk factor for transmission. Most HCP either agreed (117 (44.8%)) or strongly agreed (131 (50.2%)) that NiV is a serious illness. Less than half (121 (46.4%)) were aware of any institutional protocol for NiV; 235 (90.7%) of HCP stated that they need more information about prevention and treatment options. Knowledge scores were significantly higher among physicians compared to nurses whereas nurses and academic providers were more likely to have higher attitudes scores. A majority of respondents (20,779.9%) were willing to be vaccinated and willing to recommend the NiV vaccine to their patients (21,682.8%). Future strategies include education of HCP to bridge the knowledge gaps and enhance preparedness through disease-specific training for NiV infection.

TI  - Host ecology moderates the specialization of Neotropical bat-fly interaction networks
T2  - PARASITOLOGY RESEARCH
AB  - The transmission of diseases through parasites is a key mechanism in the regulation of plant and animal populations in ecosystems. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the relative effect of the variables that can shape the specificity of host-parasite interactions. Previous studies have found that specialization of antagonistic interactions between fly ectoparasites and bats changes according to forest type, host richness, and roosting ecology of bats. In this study, we tested these hypotheses using data from 48 bat communities. In general, our results support previous findings that bat-fly interactions are specialized, resulting in lower niche overlap among bat flies species. In addition, we found that the specificity of bat-fly interactions is lower in tropical mountain forests and is positively related with the richness of bat host species of each study site. Finally, there was a higher bat flies niche overlap in smaller bat-fly interaction networks recorded in bat roosts in caves. We conclude that the roosting ecology of bats could be a key factor to understand the mechanisms related to the horizontal transmission of ectoparasitic flies among bats.

TI  - Potential mammalian reservoirs in a bubonic plague outbreak focus in Mbulu District, northern Tanzania, in 2007
T2  - MAMMALIA
CP  - 10th International African Small Mammals Symposium
AB  - This study investigated mammalian involvement in an outbreak of bubonic plague in Mbulu District, northern Tanzania, in March 2007. Plague is a rodent-borne zoonotic disease that spreads to humans through fleas infected with Yersinia pestis. Live trapping of rodents and shrews was conducted in fallow and crop fields, peridomestic areas, houses and the neighboring forest reserve. Serum was separated from blood of captured animals. A rapid diagnostic test (RDT) was used for diagnosis of plague infection. An ELISA technique was used to detect antibodies against Yersinia pestis fraction 1 antigen. Wild and commensal rodents tested positive by RDT, indicating current infection in clinically healthy animals. The ELISA showed that wild rodents (Lophuromys flavopunctatus, Praomys delectorum, Graphiurus murinus, Lemniscomys striatus) and commensal rats ( Rattus rattus, Mastomys natalensis, Mus minutoides) were Y. pestis-positive. Two potential vectors, Xenopsylla brasiliensis and Dinopsyllus lypusus, were found on wild and commensal rodents with a flea index of 1.8. We conclude that diverse potential mammalian reservoirs and efficient vectors of Y. pestis are present in abundance in Dongobesh and could lead to persistence and future plague outbreaks.

AB  - The effects of biodiversity on the transmission of infectious diseases now stand as a cornerstone of many public health policies. The upper Amazonia and Guyana shield are hot-spots of biodiversity that offer genuine opportunities to explore the relationship between the risk of transmission of Chagas disease and the diversity of its triatomine vectors. Over 730 triatomines were light-trapped in four geomorphological landscapes shaping French-Guiana, and we determined their taxonomic status and infection by Trypanosoma cruzi. We used a model selection approach to unravel the spatial and temporal variations in species abundance, diversity and infection. The vector community in French-Guiana is typically made of one key species (Panstrongylus geniculatus) that is more abundant than three secondary species combined (Rhodnius pictipes, Panstrongylus lignarius and Eratyrus mucronatus), and four other species that complete the assemblage. Although the overall abundance of adult triatomines does not vary across French-Guiana, their diversity increases along a coastal-inland gradient. These variations unravelled a non-monotonic relationship between vector biodiversity and the risk of transmission of Chagas disease, so that intermediate biodiversity levels are associated with the lowest risks. We also observed biannual variations in triatomine abundance, representing the first report of a biannual pattern in the risk of Chagas disease transmission. Those variations were highly and negatively correlated with the average monthly rainfall. We discuss the implications of these patterns for the transmission of T. cruzi by assemblages of triatomine species, and for the dual challenge of controlling Amazonian vector communities that are made of both highly diverse and mostly intrusive species.

TI  - Prevalence of<i> Platynosomum</i> spp infection and its association with biliary lithiasis and secondary bacterial infections in free-ranging marmosets<i> (Callithrix</i> spp) of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest
T2  - JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PATHOLOGY
AB  - Platynosomosis is a parasitic disease caused by a trematode of the genus Platynosomum, a bile duct and gallbladder fluke that has been described in captive neotropical primates (New World primates; NWPs) and causes high morbidity and variable mortality. Although it is a major concern for ex-situ conservation of these animals, there are only a few studies of platynosomosis in free-ranging NWPs. Therefore, the aim of this study was to characterize platynosomosis in a free-ranging population of marmosets (Callithrix spp) from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, focusing on the epidemiological and pathological aspects of the disease. A total of 1,001 marmosets were evaluated and on the basis of clinicoepidemiological data, histopathology, histochemistry and immunohistochemistry, we concluded that Platynosomum spp infection has a prevalence of 8.9% (confidence interval: 7.3-10.8%) in free-ranging marmosets, with a higher frequency in the Metropolitan Region of Rio de Janeiro. Infection was associated with fibrosing and proliferative cholangiohepatitis associated with biliary lithiasis (3.0% of cases) and secondary bac-terial infections (14.6% of cases).(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - The potential economic value of a cutaneous leishmaniasis vaccine in seven endemic countries in the Americas
T2  - VACCINE
AB  - Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) and its associated complications, including mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (MCL) and diffuse CL (DCL) have emerged as important neglected tropical diseases in Latin America, especially in areas associated with human migration, conflict, and recent deforestation. Because of the limitations of current chemotherapeutic approaches to CL, MCL, and DCL, several prototype vaccines are in different states of product and clinical development. We constructed and utilized a Markov decision analytic computer model to evaluate the potential economic value of a preventative CL vaccine in seven countries in Latin America: Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, and Venezuela. The results indicated that even a vaccine with a relatively short duration of protection and modest efficacy could be recommended for use in targeted locations, as it could prevent a substantial number of cases at low-cost and potentially even result in cost savings. If the population in the seven countries were vaccinated using a vaccine that provides at least 10 years of protection, an estimated 41,000-144,784 CL cases could be averted, each at a cost less than the cost of current recommended treatments. Further, even a vaccine providing as little as five years duration of protection with as little as 50% efficacy remains cost-effective compared with chemotherapy; additional scenarios resembling epidemic settings such as the one that occurred in Chaparral, Colombia in 2004 demonstrate important economic benefits.

TI  - Landslide Detection and Susceptibility Modeling on Cameron Highlands (Malaysia): A Comparison between Random Forest, Logistic Regression and Logistic Model Tree Algorithms
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - We used remote sensing techniques and machine learning to detect and map landslides, and landslide susceptibility in the Cameron Highlands, Malaysia. We located 152 landslides using a combination of interferometry synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), Google Earth (GE), and field surveys. Of the total slide locations, 80% (122 landslides) were utilized for training the selected algorithms, and the remaining 20% (30 landslides) were applied for validation purposes. We employed 17 conditioning factors, including slope angle, aspect, elevation, curvature, profile curvature, stream power index (SPI), topographic wetness index (TWI), lithology, soil type, land cover, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), distance to river, distance to fault, distance to road, river density, fault density, and road density, which were produced from satellite imageries, geological map, soil maps, and a digital elevation model (DEM). We used these factors to produce landslide susceptibility maps using logistic regression (LR), logistic model tree (LMT), and random forest (RF) models. To assess prediction accuracy of the models we employed the following statistical measures: negative predictive value (NPV), sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV), specificity, root-mean-squared error (RMSE), accuracy, and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). Our results indicated that the AUC was 92%, 90%, and 88% for the LMT, LR, and RF algorithms, respectively. To assess model performance, we also applied non-parametric statistical tests of Friedman and Wilcoxon, where the results revealed that there were no practical differences among the used models in the study area. While landslide mapping in tropical environment such as Cameron Highlands remains difficult, the remote sensing (RS) along with machine learning techniques, such as the LMT model, show promise for landslide susceptibility mapping in the study area.

TI  - 25 YEARS OF BLACKFLY CONTROL IN A LOCALIZED MOIST FOREST AREA OF CAMEROON - A REVIEW
T2  - TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - The high number of blackfly bites in a moist forest area of Cameroon, around the Sanaga river, was causing considerable nuisance and had led to a local ground-based larval control campaign. We have reviewed the 25 years of almost uninterrupted weekly larvicide applications in this area and emphasized the problems related to application difficulties, environmental pollution and blackfly resistance to the insecticides. Although the number of larvicidal compounds readily available is now limited, the future of blackfly control at this site does not seem to pose real technical difficulties because of its economic importance (hydroelectric dam) and the progress made in the fields of resistance management, search for new insecticide molecules and development of new control methods.

TI  - Pollen in the atmosphere of Mexico City and its impact on the health of the pediatric population
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Over a period of eight years, were assessed the main types of airborne pollen in Mexico City (a tropical region). We established the airborne pollen calendar and we evaluated the associations between aeroallergens and allergic diseases in children treated at hospitals. A Hirst-type volumetric spore trap was placed in an open area within the Chapultepec Forest, and pollen records were obtained during the flowering period of the plants. A total of 502 patients between 1 and 17 years old were evaluated. The patients were diagnosed by skin testing with extracts of tree pollen, grass and weeds. During the monitoring period, the airborne pollen grains were dominated by trees (Fraxinus, Cupressaceae, Alnus, Quercus) followed by Poaceae, with the highest average values detected between January and February. Children with positive reactions to pollen aeroallergens were diagnosed with allergic diseases. The predominant airborne allergens were determined. An airborne pollen calendar was established. A close association was found between the most frequent and abundant pollen types and the responses of children produced by exposure to pollen grains. Children with positive reactions to pollen were diagnosed with allergic conjunctivitis, allergic rhinitis, asthma and keratoconjunctivitis.

TI  - The polymorphic landscape analysis of GATA1 exons uncovered the genetic variants associated with higher thrombocytopenia in dengue patients
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - The current study elucidated an association between gene variants and thrombocytopenia through the investigation of the exonic polymorphic landscape of hematopoietic transcription factor-GATA1 gene in dengue patients. A total of 115 unrelated dengue patients with dengue fever (DF) (N = 91) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) (N = 24) were included in the study. All dengue patients were confirmed through detection of NS1 antigen, IgM, and IgG antibodies against the dengue virus. Polymerase chain reaction using specific primers amplified the exonic regions of GATA1 while Sanger sequencing and chromatogram analyses facilitated the identification of variants. Variants G>A (at chX: 48792009) and C>A (at chX: 4879118) had higher frequency out of 13 variants identified (3 annotated and 10 newly recognized). Patients carrying either nonsynonymous or synonymous variants had significantly lower mean values of platelets compared to those harboring the reference nucleotides (NC_000023.11). Further analyses revealed that the change in amino acid residue leads to the altered three-dimensional structure followed by interaction with neighboring residues. Increased stability of the protein due to substitution of serine by asparagine (S129N at chX: 48792009) may cause increased rigidity followed by reduced structural flexibility which may ultimately disturb the dimerization (an important prerequisite for GATA1 to perform its biological activity) process of the GATA1 protein. This, in turn, may affect the function of GATA1 followed by impaired production of mature platelets which may be reflected by the lower platelet counts in individuals with such variation. In summary, we have identified new variants within the GATA1 gene which were found to be clinically relevant to the outcome of dengue patients and thus, have the potential as candidate biomarkers for the determination of severity and prognosis of thrombocytopenia caused by dengue virus. However, further validation of this study in a large number of dengue patients is warranted.

TI  - Supersuppression: Reservoir Competency and Timing of Mosquito Host Shifts Combine to Reduce Spillover of West Nile Virus
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - In the eastern United States, human cases of West Nile virus (WNV) result from spillover from urban epizootic transmission between passerine birds and Culex mosquitoes. In Atlanta, GA, substantial WNV presence in hosts and vectors has not resulted in the human disease burden observed in cities with similar infection pressure. Our study goal was to investigate extrinsic ecological conditions that potentially contribute to these reduced transmission rates. We conducted WNV surveillance among hosts and vectors in urban Atlanta and recorded an overall avian seroprevalence of nearly 30%, which was significantly higher among northern cardinals, blue jays, and members of the mimid family, and notably low among American robins. Examination of temporal Culex feeding patterns showed a marked feeding shift from American robins in the early season to northern cardinals in the late season. We therefore rule out American robins as superspreaders in the Atlanta area and suggest instead that northern cardinals and mimids act as WNV "supersuppressor" species, which slow WNV transmission by drawing many infectious bites during the critical virus amplification period, yet failing to amplify transmission due to low host competencies. Of particular interest, urban forest patches provide spillover protection by increasing the WNV amplification fraction on supersuppressor species.

TI  - Innovative and New Approaches to Laboratory Diagnosis of Zika and Dengue: A Meeting Report
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB  - Epidemics of dengue, Zika, and other arboviral diseases are increasing in frequency and severity. Current efforts to rapidly identify and manage these epidemics are limited by the short diagnostic window in acute infection, the extensive serologic cross-reactivity among flaviviruses, and the lack of point-of-care diagnostic tools to detect these viral species in primary care settings. The Partnership for Dengue Control organized a workshop to review the current landscape of Flavivirus diagnostic tools, identified current gaps, and developed strategies to accelerate the adoption of promising novel technologies into national programs. The rate-limiting step to bringing new diagnostic tools to the market is access to reference materials and well-characterized clinical samples to facilitate performance evaluation. We suggest the creation of an international laboratory-response consortium for flaviviruses with a decentralized biobank of well-characterized samples to facilitate assay validation. Access to proficiency panels are needed to ensure quality control, in additional to in-country capacity building.

TI  - Soil-Transmitted Helminths in Malaysia landscape: an aborigines study
T2  - TROPICAL BIOMEDICINE
AB  - Soil-transmitted helminths (STH) is a group of parasitic nematodes, including Trichuris trichiura, Ascaris lumbricoides, Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus, which can cause gastrointestinal disorders in humans. STH is prevalent among neglected communities in both developing and developed countries. This present study aims to determine the current prevalence of STH infections in Aboriginal population after mass delivering of antihelminthic drugs was proposed by WHO in 2005 and a health education learning package (HELP) was initiated in Malaysia in 2012. A total of 235 human fecal samples were collected and a pre-tested questionnaire was given to gather information about the socio-demographic of the Aborigine communities living in Kedah and Selangor, Malaysia. The samples were screened by a direct-fecal smear and confirmed by formalin-ether sedimentation methods. From human faeces, 81.7% was found to be infected with one or more STH species. T. trichiura was the most commonly detected (76.6%), followed by hookworms (26.4%) and A. lumbricoides (19.1%). Triple infections were found in 6.4% of the studied population. Univariate analysis showed that individuals with age group, male, presence of indoor toilet, family size with <= 7 members and bad living habits (i.e., without antihelminthic drugs) were significantly associated with STH infections. The analysis further showed that walking barefoot was the significant contributing factor to hookworm infections. The high prevalence of human STH infections is alarming. Thus, the urgency in implementing health education related behavioral practice and hygiene to reduce disease burden in these rural communities are a crucial need.

T2  - 2016 7TH IEEE CONTROL AND SYSTEM GRADUATE RESEARCH COLLOQUIUM (ICSGRC)
CP  - 7th IEEE Control and System Graduate Research Colloquium (ICSGRC)
AB  - Tree species identification is a crucial matter in forest managing and supervision. In recent years, tree species identification has been studying a lot using high-resolution satellite imagery data of 0.5m spatial resolution Worldview-3. This has because of some of the tree species have very high market value type of wood. Besides that, Tropical forest stored a large stock of carbon that contributes to the huge amount of above and below ground biomass. Hence, tree species identification is important in order to manage and control such activities like critical timber logged, forest cut for agricultural and development purposes that would affect the carbon cycle and lead to global warming affect. Tree classification using conventional method is required more time and limited accessibility for site survey, so the remote sensing technology was applied to identify tree species. In this study, tree species classification was done to identify dominant tree species had in Ayer Hitam Forest Reserve Puchong to estimate biomass values. Support Vector Machine (SVM) supervised classification method was applied in this process. This study can give some ideas to researchers in the future on what type of improvements can be made for next research and is hoped to assist the forest managers to control and manage forest ecosystems in order to reduce climate change.

TI  - Reproductive success and distance to conspecific adults in the sparsely distributed tree <i>Kalopanax pictus</i>
T2  - JOURNAL OF PLANT RESEARCH
AB  - To understand how a sparsely distributed species can maintain viable populations, and with a particular interest in distance-dependent reproductive success, we investigated the ovule survival and the factors that determine the survival for sparsely distributed Kalopanax pictus (Araliaceae) in a temperate forest landscape around the Ogawa Forest Reserve, central Japan. We found 1.54 potentially mature trees (> 20 cm diameter at breast height) in a 600-ha site. The year 2000 was a mass flowering year for K. pictus; 96.8% of the trees examined flowered in that year; however, this was less than half of the trees that flowered in other years. The flowers of K. pictus include protandrous inflorescences, which bloom on individual tress in midsummer when few other tree species bloom. We conducted pollination experiments with out-crossed, self-pollinated, bagged, and control inflorescences. Results suggest that self-pollination is limited, partially by low self-compatibility and partially by protandry. Ovule survival from the flower to the seed stages was not dependent on the temporal flowering density of conspecific adults. The flowering habit and presence of effective pollinators may allow K. pictus to avoid the negative effects of sparse distribution on pollination efficiency. However, ovule survival during the ovary development stage depended on infection by a species-specific fungus, Mycosphaerella. acanthopanacis. The fungus damages leaves, and the infection intensity depends on the distance between conspecific K. pictus adults. Thus, an advantage of sparse distribution in K. pictus is disease avoidance, whereas its disadvantages are overcome by pollination efficiency.

TI  - Cutaneous Leishmaniasis Emergence in Southeastern Mexico: The Case of the State of Yucatan
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE
AB  - Environmental changes triggered by deforestation, urban expansion and climate change are present-day drivers of the emergence and reemergence of leishmaniasis. This review describes the current epidemiological scenario and the feasible influence of environmental changes on disease occurrence in the state of Yucatan, Mexico. Relevant literature was accessed through different databases, including PubMed, Scopus, Google, and Mexican official morbidity databases. Recent LCL autochthonous cases, potential vector sandflies and mammal hosts/reservoirs also have been reported in several localities of Yucatan without previous historical records of the disease. The impact of deforestation, urban expansion and projections on climate change have been documented. The current evidence of the relationships between the components of the transmission cycle, the disease occurrence, and the environmental changes on the leishmaniasis emergence in the state shows the need for strength and an update to the intervention and control strategies through a One Health perspective.

TI  - Arboviruses in Mammals in the Neotropics: A Systematic Review to Strengthen Epidemiological Monitoring Strategies and Conservation Medicine
T2  - VIRUSES-BASEL
AB  - Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) are a diverse group of ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses, with the exception of African swine fever virus, that are transmitted by hematophagous arthropods to a vertebrate host. They are the important cause of many diseases due to their ability to spread in different environments and their diversity of vectors. Currently, there is no information on the geographical distribution of the diseases because the routes of transmission and the mammals (wild or domestic) that act as potential hosts are poorly documented or unknown. We conducted a systematic review from 1967 to 2021 to identify the diversity of arboviruses, the areas, and taxonomic groups that have been monitored, the prevalence of positive records, and the associated risk factors. We identified forty-three arboviruses in nine mammalian orders distributed in eleven countries. In Brazil, the order primates harbor the highest number of arbovirus records. The three most recorded arboviruses were Venezuelan equine encephalitis, Saint Louis encephalitis and West Nile virus. Serum is the most used sample to obtain arbovirus records. Deforestation is identified as the main risk factor for arbovirus transmission between different species and environments (an odds ratio of 1.46 with a 95% confidence interval: 1.34-1.59). The results show an increase in the sampling effort over the years in the neotropical region. Despite the importance of arboviruses for public health, little is known about the interaction of arboviruses, their hosts, and vectors, as some countries and mammalian orders have not yet been monitored. Long-term and constant monitoring allows focusing research on the analysis of the interrelationships and characteristics of each component animal, human, and their environment to understand the dynamics of the diseases and guide epidemiological surveillance and vector control programs. The biodiversity of the Neotropics should be considered to support epidemiological monitoring strategies.

TI  - Genome-wide parallelism underlies contemporary adaptation in urban lizards
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
AB  - Urbanization drastically transforms landscapes, resulting in fragmentation, degra-dation, and the loss of local biodiversity. Yet, urban environments also offer oppor-tunities to observe rapid evolutionary change in wild populations that survive and even thrive in these novel habitats. In many ways, cities represent replicated "natural experiments" in which geographically separated populations adaptively respond to similar selection pressures over rapid evolutionary timescales. Little is known, how-ever, about the genetic basis of adaptive phenotypic differentiation in urban popula-tions nor the extent to which phenotypic parallelism is reflected at the genomic level with signatures of parallel selection. Here, we analyzed the genomic underpinnings of parallel urban-associated phenotypic change in Anolis cristatellus, a small-bodied neotropical lizard found abundantly in both urbanized and forested environments. We show that phenotypic parallelism in response to parallel urban environmental change is underlain by genomic parallelism and identify candidate loci across the Anolis genome associated with this adaptive morphological divergence. Our find-ings point to polygenic selection on standing genetic variation as a key process to effectuate rapid morphological adaptation. Identified candidate loci represent several functions associated with skeletomuscular development, morphology, and human disease. Taken together, these results shed light on the genomic basis of complex morphological adaptations, provide insight into the role of contingency and deter-minism in adaptation to novel environments, and underscore the value of urban environments to address fundamental evolutionary questions.

TI  - Monitoring environmental indicators of vector-borne disease from space: a new opportunity for RADARSAT-2
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Environmental vector-borne diseases are plaguing much of the world and are a serious concern on a global scale. Many of these diseases are clearly associated with specific environmental conditions and landscape variables. The science and technology associated with remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS) are suitable for identifying these environmental targets. Since vector-borne diseases are most often found in tropical environments and during rainy seasons with persistent cloud cover conditions, radar is an important sensor for monitoring and mapping the environmental indicators of disease. Preliminary investigations using RADARSAT-1 C-band horizontal transmit, horizontal receive (C-HH) imagery have proven especially useful for identifying wetland habitats and flooded areas. It is anticipated that the advancements associated with upcoming RADARSAT-2 sensors will improve the science of mapping vector-borne disease risk in tropical areas, particularly with access to increased spatial and temporal resolution and fully polarimetric data. This paper discusses the concept of using radar remote sensing for epidemiology applications, results using RADARSAT-1 for malaria risk mapping in coastal Kenya, and expected results with the advanced capabilities of RADARSAT-2.

TI  - <i>Colletotrichum</i> (Ascomycota, Glomerellaceae) associated with native woody plants in natural ecosystems: What do we know?
T2  - FOREST PATHOLOGY
AB  - The genus Colletotrichum comprises an important and diverse group of endophytes, saprophytes and plant pathogens, many of which cause a syndrome known as anthracnose, on a wide range of hosts, mainly in tropical and subtropical regions. Since most of the accumulated research on the genus focuses on cultivated plants of commercial interest, the aim of this review was to explore how the genus has been studied in native woody plants in natural ecosystems. Following the PRISMA protocol for systematic reviews, we identified 52 original scientific publications that recorded Colletotrichum species associated with native woody hosts in natural environments in a taxonomic, ecological or phytosanitary context. Here, we conclude that research in natural ecosystems is scarce, mostly carried out in tropical areas and mainly focused on aspects of community ecology. We also observed the cosmopolitan nature of the genus, associated with many hosts, mostly as endophytes. The species most frequently recorded were in the 'gloeosporioides' complex, although due to the limitations in identification methods used in the studies, a large proportion of records could not be identified or verified at the species level.

TI  - Geographic distribution of the European hare (<i>Lepus europaeus</i>) in Brazil and new records of occurrence for the Cerrado and Atlantic Forest biomes
T2  - MAMMALIA
AB  - The introduction of alien species is among the main causes of biodiversity loss. There are many documented cases of introduced mammals having severe impacts on the ecosystem. The European hare (Lepus europaeus), native to Europe and Asia, was introduced to southern Brazil in the 1950s and has since expanded its geographic distribution considerably. In this study, we present a review of the known distribution of the European hare in Brazil, add new records of occurrence that expand the species distribution into southeastern Brazil and estimate the species dispersal rate in Brazil. We compiled at total of 135 distinct localities of occurrence for the species in Brazil, including published records and the previously unknown localities presented here. These records indicate a dispersal rate of 45.35 km/year for the introduced species. Of these known localities, 15 are in protected areas. Because of its high potential for even greater geographic dispersal and potential impacts on native species through competition and disease transmission, we recommend further research to better assess the species status and the implementation of public policies and management controls, especially in protected areas.

TI  - Communities of endophytic fungi in leaves of a tropical timber tree (<i>Guarea guidonia</i>: Meliaceae)
T2  - BIOTROPICA
AB  - Endophytes are microorganisms that live inside plant tissues without causing symptoms of disease. They are a largely unexplored component of biodiversity, especially in the tropics. In this study, leaves from two populations of Guarea guidonia trees (Meliaceae) in the Luquillo region, Puerto Rico, were screened for diversity and composition of endophytic fungal communities. A total of 268 leaf fragments from 14 trees were surveyed. Thirty-eight morphospecies of endophytes were found. Phomopsis, Colletotrichum, Xylaria, and Rhizoctonia-like fungi were the most abundant taxa. Over 95 percent of the leaf pieces had endophytes. Communities had a few abundant species and many species with few individuals The Fungal community from the Guarea population in a forest preserve was more diverse than that From a disturbed area. Fungal communities were stratified according to height within a tree, but no differences were found between blade, petiolule, and rachis. The data suggest thar the smaller and che more scattered the plant fragments sampled, the higher the probability of approaching real diversity values of endophytic Fungal communities.

TI  - Molecular prevalence, genetic characterization and patterns of <i>Toxoplasma gondii </i>infection in domestic small mammals from Cotonou, Benin
T2  - PARASITE
AB  - Toxoplasmosis, one of the most prevalent parasitic infections in humans and animals, is caused by the intracellular protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii. Small mammals play a key role as intermediate reservoir hosts in the maintenance of the T. gondii life cycle. In this study, we estimated the molecular prevalence and provide genetic diversity data for T. gondii in 632 small mammals sampled in four areas of Cotonou city, Benin. Both the brain and heart of each individual were screened through T. gondii-targeting qPCR, and positive samples were then genotyped using a set of 15 T. gondii-specific microsatellites. Prevalence data were statistically analyzed in order to assess the relative impact of individual host characteristics, spatial distribution, composition of small mammal community, and urban landscape features. An overall T. gondii molecular prevalence of 15.2% was found and seven genotypes, all belonging to the Africa 1 lineage, could be retrieved from the invasive black rat Rattus rattus and the native African giant shrew Crocidura olivieri. Statistical analyses did not suggest any significant influence of the environmental parameters used in this study. Rather, depending on the local context, T. gondii prevalence appeared to be associated either with black rat, shrew, or mouse abundance or with the trapping period. Overall, our results highlight the intricate relationships between biotic and abiotic factors involved in T. gondii epidemiology and suggest that R. rattus and C. olivieri are two competent reservoirs for the Africa 1 lineage, a widespread lineage in tropical Africa and the predominant lineage in Benin.

TI  - A Spatial Downscaling Algorithm for Satellite-Based Precipitation over the Tibetan Plateau Based on NDVI, DEM, and Land Surface Temperature
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Precipitation is an important controlling parameter for land surface processes, and is crucial to ecological, environmental, and hydrological modeling. In this study, we propose a spatial downscaling approach based on precipitation-land surface characteristics. Land surface temperature features were introduced as new variables in addition to the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) to improve the spatial downscaling algorithm. Two machine learning algorithms, Random Forests (RF) and support vector machine (SVM), were implemented to downscale the yearly Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission 3B43 V7 (TRMM 3B43 V7) precipitation data from 25 km to 1 km over the Tibetan Plateau area, and the downscaled results were validated on the basis of observations from meteorological stations and comparisons with previous downscaling algorithms. According to the validation results, the RF and SVM-based models produced higher accuracy than the exponential regression (ER) model and multiple linear regression (MLR) model. The downscaled results also had higher accuracy than the original TRMM 3B43 V7 dataset. Moreover, models including land surface temperature variables (LSTs) performed better than those without LSTs, indicating the significance of considering precipitation-land surface temperature when downscaling TRMM 3B43 V7 precipitation data. The RF model with only NDVI and DEM produced much worse accuracy than the SVM model with the same variables. This indicates that the Random Forests algorithm is more sensitive to LSTs than the SVM when downscaling yearly TRMM 3B43 V7 precipitation data over Tibetan Plateau. Moreover, the precipitation-LSTs relationship is more instantaneous, making it more likely to downscale precipitation at a monthly or weekly temporal scale.

TI  - Species richness and evenness respond to diverging land-use patterns - a cross-border study of dry tropical woodlands in southern Africa
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
AB  - Cross-border studies offer unique situations to study the impact of different land-use regimes on ecosystems. Along the Angolan and Namibian border formed by the Okavango River, the environmental conditions and traditional land-use practises are the same on either side of the river. However, decades of civil war in Angola led to a stagnant development while political stability in Namibia fostered a recent socio-economic transformation. We investigated the impact of spatially diffuse land use on plant diversity of the dry tropical woodlands covering the vast, sandy hinterlands of the river. As accessibility is the major factor governing land use, we used distance to road as a proxy for land-use intensity. Based on 58 vegetation plots sized 20 m x 50 m, we showed that species richness increased with distance to road in Angola while in Namibia it remained constant on a lower level. Evenness showed an inverse pattern to species richness and Shannon diversity index showed no response. Analysing diversity patterns according to life forms revealed that these patterns are primarily driven by woody species. The study showed that spatially diffuse land use has a measurable effect on plant diversity and illustrates that roads act as vectors of change.

TI  - River dynamics shape clonal diversity and genetic structure of an Amazonian understorey herb
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
AB  - 1. Clonal herbs are an important feature of the understorey of Amazonian forests. However, little is known about the environmental drivers determining the population genetics of these herbs and about the spatial scale of gene flow.
   2. With amplified fragment length polymorphism markers, we analysed the clonal diversity and genetic structure of a clonal Amazonian herb (Heliconia metallica) in south-eastern Peru at two spatial scales. First, we sampled leaves in 24 patches differing in flooding frequency and canopy openness in 2 km(2) of a floodplain forest, and second in 21 riverine populations from the Andean foothills to the Amazon lowlands along a 550-km stretch of river.
   3. At the small spatial scale in the floodplain forest, the clonal diversity of H. metallica was higher at flooded than at non-flooded sites, but clonal diversity did not increase with canopy openness.
   4. At the large spatial scale, clonal diversity was very low in riverine populations at up- and downriver sites, suggesting that seedling recruitment was higher at mid-altitudes where the flooding intensity is intermediate. Genetic diversity of riverine populations monotonously increased downriver, indicating unidirectional gene flow mediated by hydrochory.
   5. Genetic differentiation among riverine populations was very low (F-ST = 0.06) and followed an isolation-by-distance pattern, indicating a stepping-stone type of gene flow by seeds. Despite the much smaller spatial scale, genetic differentiation among patches in the floodplain forest was higher (F-ST = 0.16), due to spatially restricted gene flow in the forest understorey.
   6. Synthesis. The genetic structure of H. metallica is the result of seedling recruitment being largely limited to flooded sites and of hydrochoric seed dispersal between populations growing on river-banks. We conclude that river dynamics are the major determinant of the genetic structure of Amazonian plants and that largely undisturbed river systems, such as the Amazon, provide a crucial vector for gene flow, even at large spatial scales.

T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
AB  - Mayaro virus (MAYV) disease is a mosquito-borne zoonosis endemic in humid forests of tropical South America. MAYV is closely related to other alphaviruses that produce a dengue-like illness accompanied by long-lasting arthralgia. A French tourist developed high-grade fever and severe joint manifestations following a 15-day trip in the Amazon basin, Brazil, and was diagnosed with MAYV infection in January 2010. This case is the first reported in a traveller returning from an endemic South American country to Europe.

TI  - Temporal analysis of charcoal root rot in forest nurseries under different pathogen inoculum densities and soil moisture content
T2  - TROPICAL PLANT PATHOLOGY
AB  - The progress of charcoal root rot (CRR) disease in Pinus radiata seedlings caused by Macrophomina phaseolina was evaluated in greenhouse and field trials. In one greenhouse trial P radiata was sown in a sandy soil with pathogen inoculum densities (ID) ranging from 25 to 1000 cfu.g(-1). After two months, the seedlings were established under three soil moisture content (SMC) levels corresponding to 100%, 75% and 50% of field capacity (FC). In one field trial, P radiata was sown on microplots infested with ID of 50 to 250 cfu.g(-1). In the greenhouse trial the disease incidence was related with the pathogen ID and SMC. At 100% FC, the seedlings remained asymptomatic until the experiment ended, however M. phaseolina was able to infect the roots. In the field trial, the disease progress curves were similar to those of the greenhouse trial in response to ID and SMC but the plant mortality due to CRR incidence did not exceed 50%. The monomolecular model was the one that best fitted the disease progress curve data for both trials and most treatments. Knowledge of the existing ID of M. phaseolina in the soil, combined with information on SMC, may be important for predicting CRR epidemics in P radiata nurseries.

TI  - An Ecological Model for Quantitative Risk Assessment for Schistosomiasis: The Case of a Patchy Environment in the Coastal Tropical Area of Northeastern Brazil
T2  - RISK ANALYSIS
AB  - We developed a stochastic model for quantitative risk assessment for the Schistosoma mansoni (SM) parasite, which causes an endemic disease of public concern. The model provides answers in a useful format for public health decisions, uses data and expert opinion, and can be applied to any landscape where the snail Biomphalaria glabrata is the main intermediate host (South and Central America, the Caribbean, and Africa). It incorporates several realistic and case-specific features: stage-structured parasite populations, periodic praziquantel (PZQ) drug treatment for humans, density dependence, extreme events (prolonged rainfall), site-specific sanitation quality, environmental stochasticity, monthly rainfall variation, uncertainty in parameters, and spatial dynamics. We parameterize the model through a real-world application in the district of Porto de Galinhas (PG), one of the main touristic destinations in Brazil, where previous studies identified four parasite populations within the metapopulation. The results provide a good approximation of the dynamics of the system and are in agreement with our field observations, i.e., the lack of basic infrastructure (sanitation level and health programs) makes PG a suitable habitat for the persistence and growth of a parasite metapopulation. We quantify the risk of SM metapopulation explosion and quasi-extinction and the time to metapopulation explosion and quasi-extinction. We evaluate the sensitivity of the results under varying scenarios of future periodic PZQ treatment (based on the Brazilian Ministry of Health's plan) and sanitation quality. We conclude that the plan might be useful to slow SM metapopulation growth but not to control it. Additional investments in better sanitation are necessary.

TI  - Research on the isolation and identification of black spot disease of <i>Rosa</i><i>chinensis</i> in Kunming, China
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Through a survey of rose diseases in the South Tropical Garden in Kunming, China, it was found that black spot was the most common and serious disease of rose cultivated in the open air there, with an incidence of more than 90%. In this study, fungus isolation was performed on leaf samples of five black spot susceptible varieties of rose from the South Tropical Garden by tissue isolation. 18 strains of fungus were initially obtained, and seven of them were finally identified to cause black spot symptoms on healthy leaves of rose after verification by Koch's rule. By observing the morphology of colonies and spores, and constructing a phylogenetic tree by combining molecular biology and multiple genes, two pathogenic fungus were identified, namely, Alternariaalternata and Gnomoniopsisrosae.G.rosae was the first pathogenic fungi of rose black spot isolated and identified in this study. The results of this study can provide a reference base for further research and control of the black spot disease of rose in Kunming.

TI  - <i>Palicourea marcgravii</i>(Rubiaceae) poisoning in cattle grazing in Brazil
T2  - TROPICAL ANIMAL HEALTH AND PRODUCTION
AB  - Palicourea marcgraviiis the most important poisonous plant of cattle in Brazil. It contains monofluoroacetic acid and causes sudden death associated with exercise. Herein, we describe the temporal and spatial distribution of the toxic disease. The survey was based on the epidemiological, clinical, and pathological data of theSetor de Anatomia Patologica(SAP) of theUniversidade Federal Rural do Rio de Janeiro(UFRuralRJ) to report outbreaks of poisoning byP. marcgravii, from 1953 to 2018. Clinical signs were peracute and included labored breathing, loss of balance, muscle tremors, lateral recumbency, and limb paddling. Gross lesions such as congestion of large vessels and edema and pulmonary congestion were observed. Multifocal areas of vacuolar hydropic degeneration of distal contorted tubule cells with nuclear pyknosis were observed in the kidneys. The plant is found in forests, and the poisoning occurs mainly after clearing forests for pasture, in areas of natural forest recovery called "capoeira," which provide a favorable environment for maintainingP. marcgraviigrowth. Outbreaks ofP. marcgraviipoisoning coincided with periods of creation of large deforested pastures in the Southeast and Midwest regions of Brazil, and the poisoning should be considered an additional risk after deforestation. The most effective prophylaxis is fencing off the forest areas that contain these plants.

TI  - Mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) From the Northwestern Brazilian Amazon: Padauari River
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - The mosquito fauna (Culicidae) from remote northern areas of the State of Amazonas were sampled using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Shannon, Malaise, and Suspended traps, together with net sweeping and immature collections. One hundred and seven collections were performed in five localities along the Padauari River, State of Amazonas, Brazil, during June 2010. The 20,557 mosquitoes collected are distributed in 17 genera, representing 117 different species, of which four are new distributional records for the State of Amazonas. Furthermore, there are 10 morphospecies that may represent undescribed new taxa, eight of which are also new records for the State of Amazonas. The genus Culex had the highest number of species and the largest number of individuals. Aedes and Psorophora both represented 10% of the total sample and had the second highest number of species and individuals. The most abundant species was Culex (Melanoconion) gnomatos Sallum, Hutchings & Ferreira, followed by Aedes (Ochlerotatus) fulvus (Wiedemann), Culex (Melanoconion) vaxus Dyar, Culex (Melanoconion) portesi Senevet & Abonnenc, Psorophora (Janthinosoma) amazonica Cerqueira, Culex (Culex) mollis Dyar & Knab, Psorophora (Janthinosoma) albigenu (Peryassu), and Culex (Melanoconion) theobaldi Lutz. The epidemiological and ecological implications of mosquito species found are discussed and are compared with other mosquito inventories from the Amazon region. The results represent the most diverse standardized inventory of mosquitoes along the Padauari River, with the identification of 127 species-level taxa distributed in five localities, within two municipalities (Barcelos and Santa Isabel do Rio Negro).

TI  - Converting small holder vegetable farms to sustainable production in tropical High Andean conditions
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY OF HORTICULTURAL SYSTEMS IN THE 21ST CENTURY
CP  - 26th International Horticultural Congress
AB  - Small holder vegetable farms of the municipality of Cota in the Bogota plateau in Colombia are typically one hectare or less in size. Although the climate allows for year-round production, the farmers live precariously due to a high dependence on external inputs, poor access to different sources of information on production technology and lack of control over market prices. An interactive methodology for conversion to ecological farming practices based on the European prototyping experience was developed with the farmers. Here, a more participatory approach was used in the diagnosis, of restrictions to sustainability, as well as for the implementation of the conversion process. The latter is based on ecological sequence, farmers' needs and capacities, and market demand. Furthermore, upscaling the conversion process was studied by proposing an option for redesigning the landscape within the context of ecological production.
   Because ecological farming is based on observation and inference to understand the relationship between plants and their environment and so prevent future problems, the effects of actions must be looked at in the long term. The farmers were therefore required to go through a serious learning process in order to know how to implement ecologically sound agricultural practices. By combining their farming experience and knowledge of the area with scientific knowledge on soil microbiology, plant nutrition, pest and disease management including enhancement of biological control through the establishment of live fences, a viable methodology for converting farms has emerged. An interesting alternative is now available to the farmers to improve their income by supplying the growing niche for ecologically friendly produce in the local market.

TI  - Chagas Cardiomyopathy in the Context of the Chronic Disease Transition
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background: Patients with Chagas disease have migrated to cities, where obesity, hypertension and other cardiac risk factors are common.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: The study included adult patients evaluated by the cardiology service in a public hospital in Santa Cruz, Bolivia. Data included risk factors for T. cruzi infection, medical history, physical examination, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, and contact 9 months after initial data collection to ascertain mortality. Serology and PCR for Trypanosoma cruzi were performed. Of 394 participants, 251 (64%) had confirmed T. cruzi infection by serology. Among seropositive participants, 109 (43%) had positive results by conventional PCR; of these, 89 (82%) also had positive results by real time PCR. There was a high prevalence of hypertension (64%) and overweight (body mass index [BMI]>25; 67%), with no difference by T. cruzi infection status. Nearly 60% of symptomatic congestive heart failure was attributed to Chagas cardiomyopathy; mortality was also higher for seropositive than seronegative patients (p = 0.05). In multivariable models, longer residence in an endemic province, residence in a rural area and poor housing conditions were associated with T. cruzi infection. Male sex, increasing age and poor housing were independent predictors of Chagas cardiomyopathy severity. Males and participants with BMI <= 25 had significantly higher likelihood of positive PCR results compared to females or overweight participants.
   Conclusions: Chagas cardiomyopathy remains an important cause of congestive heart failure in this hospital population, and should be evaluated in the context of the epidemiological transition that has increased risk of obesity, hypertension and chronic cardiovascular disease.

TI  - Landscape-level vegetation classification and fractional woody and herbaceous vegetation cover estimation over the dryland ecosystems by unmanned aerial vehicle platform
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
AB  - The change of fraction vegetation cover (FVC) is the key ecological index for vegetation dynamics of dryland ecosystem. However, it is difficult to directly map woody vegetation and herbaceous vegetation in the dryland from the satellite images due to the mixture of their distribution at small scale. Emerging UAV remote sensing provides a good opportunity to capture and quantify the distribution of the sparse vegetation in the drylands ecosystem. In this study, we proposed a new method to classify woody vegetation and herbaceous vegetation and calculate their FVC based on the high-resolution orthomosaic generated from UAV images by the machine learning algorithm of classification and regression tree (CART). This proposed method was validated and evaluated by visual interpretation, the detailed ground measurement dataset of 4832 trees and 18,798 shrubs and three popular machine learning algorithms of Support Vector Machine(SVM), Random Forest(RF), Gradient Boosting Decision Tree(GBDT). The overall assessments showed good overall accuracy (0.78), average accuracy (0.76), and the Kappa coefficient (0.64). The FVC of woody vegetation calculated from orthomosaic agreed well with that estimated from ground measurements. Both group of FVC have a stable linear relationship over different spatial scales. The proposed method showed higher efficiency of 166%, 111% and 290% than SVM, RF, GBDT respectively. A new optimized model was developed to reduce the workload of vegetation investigation and to design more efficient sampling strategies. The proposed method was incorporated into an interactive web-based software "UAV-High Resolution imagery Analysis Platform" (UAV-HiRAP, http://www.uav-hirap.org). Our study demonstrates that UAV-HiRAP combined with UAV platform can be a powerful tool to classify woody vegetation and herbaceous vegetation and calculate their FVC for sparse vegetation in the drylands. The new optimization model will inspire researchers to design more effective sampling strategies for future field investigation.

TI  - Entomological Characterization and Natural Infection of Anophelines in an Area of the Atlantic Forest with Autochthonous Malaria Cases in Mountainous Region of Espirito Santo State, Brazil
T2  - NEOTROPICAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - Autochthonous malaria cases in the state of Espirito Santo, Brazil, are distributed in mountainous regions surrounded by the Atlantic Forest. While some aspects of this disease are unclear, detection of possible vector species can help to elucidate epidemiological uncertainties. Entomological and natural infection studies were carried out using anophelines (Diptera: Culicidae) captured in the municipality of Santa Tereza, ES. Monthly captures were made from March 2004 to February 2006. CDC-CO2 traps were used from dusk (6: 00 P. M.) to dawn (6: 00 A. M.) to capture anophelines in the following habitats: near the houses, in open areas (at ground level) and inside, and at the margins of the forest (canopy and ground level). Shannon light traps were also used at the same locations of the CDC-CO2 traps. A total of 2,290 anophelines within 10 species were captured. The relative frequency of Anopheles (Kerteszia) cruzii Dyar & Knab / A. (K.) homunculus Komp was the highest, with the majority captured in CDC-CO2 traps installed in the forest canopy. The main species captured in Shannon traps was A. (Nyssorhynchus) strodei Root. The largest number of anophelines was captured from July to September and from 6: 00 P. M. to 10: 00 P. M. Anopheles (K.) cruzii is the probable vector for malaria transmission inside or near the Atlantic Forest fragments, but the role of other species cannot be ignored, as 53% of the sampled anophelines belonged to the subgenus Nyssorhynchus. The natural infection of A. cruzii, A. parvus (Chagas) and A. galvaoi Causey, Deane & Deane by Plasmodium vivax detected by PCR from DNA extracted from their thoraxes supports this view.

TI  - Comparison of machine learning algorithms for mapping mango plantations based on Gaofen-1 imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE AGRICULTURE
AB  - Mango is a commercial crop on Hainan Island, China, that is cultivated to develop the tropical rural economy. The development of accurate and up-to-date maps of the spatial distribution of mango plantations is necessary for agricultural monitoring and decision management by the local government. Pixel-based and object-oriented image analysis methods for mapping mango plantations were compared using two machine learning algorithms (support vector machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF)) based on Chinese high-resolution Gaofen-1 (GF-1) imagery in parts of Hainan Island. To assess the importance of different features on classification accuracy, a combined layer of four original bands, 32 gray-level co-occurrence (GLCM) texture indices, and 10 vegetation indices were used as input features. Then five different sets of variables (5, 10, 20, and 30 input variables and all 46 variables) were classified with the two machine learning algorithms at object-based level. Results of the feature optimization suggested that homogeneity and variance were very important variables for distinguishing mango plantations patches. The object-based classifiers could significantly improve overall accuracy between 2-7% when compared to pixel-based classifiers. When there were 5 and 10 input variables, SVM showed higher classification accuracy than RF, and when the input variables exceeded 20, RF showed better performances. After the accuracy achieved saturation points, there were only slightly classification accuracy improvements along with the numbers of feature increases for both of SVM and RF classifiers. The results indicated that GF-1 imagery can be successfully applied to mango plantation mapping in tropical regions, which would provide a useful framework for accurate tropical agriculture land management.

TI  - Exploring the Emerging Trends of Spatial Epidemiology: A Scientometric Analysis Based on CiteSpace
T2  - SAGE OPEN
AB  - Infectious diseases are common challenges faced by people around the world, which jeopardize public health, as well as human well-being in various aspects of social and economic development. Although much progress has been made in spatial epidemiology, there is still very little scientific understanding of knowledge domain mapping with scientometric analysis. Based on a total of 4,552 literature records collected from the Web of Science Core Collection (TM), quantitative changes, research frontiers, research hotspots, and collaboration networks were analyzed by CiteSpace. The results show that both total publications and sum of times cited per year exhibit a rapid development trend in recent decades. The USA, England, and France are highly active in the field. The network of documents co-citation analysis is validated with almost same importance of documents, and primary research frontiers are landscape genetics, modeling and spatial analysis, and tropical diseases. The clustering of the keywords co-occurrence analysis network is heterogeneous and highly reliable, and research hotspots are related to phoma stem canker, vector preference, and aerosol chemical component. Scholars in the field of spatial epidemiology are closely connected, and they have been in a stable cooperative network, as well as institutions. Overall, scientometric analysis based on CiteSpace provides a sound tool to better understand the frontiers, hotspots, and emerging trends in the research domain of spatial epidemiology.

TI  - Variety matters: adaptive genetic diversity and parasite load in two mouse opossums from the Brazilian Atlantic forest
T2  - CONSERVATION GENETICS
AB  - The adaptive potential of a species to a changing environment and in disease defence is primarily based on genetic variation. Immune genes, such as genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), may thereby be of particular importance. In marsupials, however, there is very little knowledge about natural levels and functional importance of MHC polymorphism, despite their key role in the mammalian evolution. In a previous study, we discovered remarkable differences in the MHC class II diversity between two species of mouse opossums (Gracilinanus microtarsus, Marmosops incanus) from the Brazilian Atlantic forest, which is one of the most endangered hotspots for biodiversity conservation. Since the main forces in generating MHC diversity are assumed to be pathogens, we investigated in this study gastrointestinal parasite burden and functional associations between the individual MHC constitution and parasite load. We tested two contrasting scenarios, which might explain differences in MHC diversity between species. We predicted that a species with low MHC diversity would either be under relaxed selection pressure by low parasite diversity ('Evolutionary equilibrium' scenario), or there was a recent loss in MHC diversity leading to a lack of resistance alleles and increased parasite burden ('Unbalanced situation' scenario). In both species it became apparent that the MHC class II is functionally important in defence against gastrointestinal helminths, which was shown here for the first time in marsupials. On the population level, parasite diversity did not markedly differ between the two host species. However, we did observe considerable differences in the individual parasite load (parasite prevalence and infection intensity): while M. incanus revealed low MHC DAB diversity and high parasite load, G. microtarsus showed a tenfold higher population wide MHC DAB diversity and lower parasite burden. These results support the second scenario of an unbalanced situation.

TI  - The Dispersal Ecology of Rhodesian Sleeping Sickness Following Its Introduction to a New Area
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Tsetse-transmitted human and animal trypanosomiasis are constraints to both human and animal health in sub-Saharan Africa, and although these diseases have been known for over a century, there is little recent evidence demonstrating how the parasites circulate in natural hosts and ecosystems. The spread of Rhodesian sleeping sickness (caused by Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense) within Uganda over the past 15 years has been linked to the movement of infected, untreated livestock (the predominant reservoir) from endemic areas. However, despite an understanding of the environmental dependencies of sleeping sickness, little research has focused on the environmental factors controlling transmission establishment or the spatially heterogeneous dispersal of disease following a new introduction. In the current study, an annually stratified case-control study of Rhodesian sleeping sickness cases from Serere District, Uganda was used to allow the temporal assessment of correlations between the spatial distribution of sleeping sickness and landscape factors. Significant relationships were detected between Rhodesian sleeping sickness and selected factors, including elevation and the proportion of land which was "seasonally flooding grassland" or "woodlands and dense savannah." Temporal trends in these relationships were detected, illustrating the dispersal of Rhodesian sleeping sickness into more 'suitable' areas over time, with diminishing dependence on the point of introduction in concurrence with an increasing dependence on environmental and landscape factors. These results provide a novel insight into the ecology of Rhodesian sleeping sickness dispersal and may contribute towards the implementation of evidence-based control measures to prevent its further spread.

TI  - Natural <i>Anaplasma phagocytophilum</i> infection of ticks and rodents from a forest area of Jilin Province, China
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Polymerase chain reaction integrated with sequence analysis was carried out to investigate the natural Anaplasma phagocytophilum infection in ticks and rodents from a forest area of Jilin Province, China. Four (4.0%) of 100 Ixodes persulcatus and 2 (0.7%) of 286 Dermacentor silvarum ticks collected by flagging vegetation were positive. Nine (8.8%) of 102 rodents were infected, as well as 2 (2.8%) of 71 I. persulcatus parasitizing on 25 rodents. The nucleotide sequences of 1.442-bp A. phagocytophilum 16S rRNA gene amplified from rodents and ticks were identical to each other and to that previously reported in Heilongjiang Province of China (GenBank accession no. AF205140), but different from those of other countries. The sequences of 357-bp partial citrate synthase gene from the above specimens were homologic, and varied from known A. phagocytophilum agents. These findings add new information on the ecologic features of A. phagocytophilum and indicate the threat of anaplasmosis in the area.

TI  - <i>Periconiella lecythidis</i> sp nov., the causal agent of a zonate leaf spot disease of the Brazilian tree <i>Lecythis pisonis</i>
T2  - MYCOLOGICAL PROGRESS
AB  - A new defoliating disease was observed on 20-year-old trees of Lecythis pisonis in Vicosa, Minas Gerais, Brazil. The disease is characterized by forming one or more large zonate epiphyllous leaf spots with a light brown to white center, followed by two to three zones gradually varying from brown to red-brown. On the corresponding abaxial leaf surface, the spots are lighter with a profuse greenish gray coloration caused by the fungal colonies. In PDA culture, the fungus is characterized by a slow growth of the colonies with brown-violet pigmentation at the reverse. Inoculation tests carried out on healthy plants of L. pisonis confirmed the pathogenicity of this fungus. Periconiella lecythidis sp. nov., the causal agent of the zonate leaf spot disease of L. pisonis is described, illustrated, discussed and compared with the other species of the genus Periconiella. The intricate generic affinity within a complex of morphologically similar hyphomycete genera consisting of Metulocladosporiella, Parapericoniella, Penidiella and Periconiella is discussed in detail.

TI  - GROWTH OF NATIVE TREES IN TWO AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
AB  - Agroforestry systems with eucalyptus prevail in Central and Southeast Brazil, and little information is available about systems using native trees. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the development of seven native tree species grown under two agroforestry systems. The experiment was conducted starting in 2007 in 12-hectare area in the municipality of Sao Carlos, Sao Paulo state, Brazil. The tree species planted in the two systems (a silvopastoral system and an agrisilvicultural system) were: 'capixingui' (Croton floribundus) and 'mutambo' (Guazuma ulmifolia) (tutors), 'jequitiba- branco' (Cariniana estrellensis), 'canafistula' (Peltophorum dubium) and 'ipe felpudo' (Zeyheria tuberculosa) (timber trees), and 'angico-branco' (Anadenanthera colubrina) and 'pau-jacar' (Piptadenia gonoacantha) (N-fixing trees). Data were collected for 48 months. The results show differences among tree development, which was evaluated as growth in height and diameter, as well as sensitivity to insect and disease damage. The overall results show that the agrisilvicultural system allowed better tree development. The species with best performance in the two systems were capixingui, mutambo and canafistula. Ipe-felpudo and jequitiba-branco showed the worst results. The high variability among individuals of the same species indicates the possibility of high production advances with selective breeding of these species.

TI  - Predicting Optical Water Quality Indicators from Remote Sensing Using Machine Learning Algorithms in Tropical Highlands of Ethiopia
T2  - HYDROLOGY
AB  - Water quality degradation of freshwater bodies is a concern worldwide, particularly in Africa, where data are scarce and standard water quality monitoring is expensive. This study explored the use of remote sensing imagery and machine learning (ML) algorithms as an alternative to standard field measuring for monitoring water quality in large and remote areas constrained by logistics and finance. Six machine learning (ML) algorithms integrated with Landsat 8 imagery were evaluated for their accuracy in predicting three optically active water quality indicators observed monthly in the period from August 2016 to April 2022: turbidity (TUR), total dissolved solids (TDS) and Chlorophyll a (Chl-a). The six ML algorithms studied were the artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine regression (SVM), random forest regression (RF), XGBoost regression (XGB), AdaBoost regression (AB), and gradient boosting regression (GB) algorithms. XGB performed best at predicting Chl-a, with an R-2 of 0.78, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) of 0.78, mean absolute relative error (MARE) of 0.082 and root mean squared error (RMSE) of 9.79 mu g/L. RF performed best at predicting TDS (with an R-2 of 0.79, NSE of 0.80, MARE of 0.082, and RMSE of 12.30 mg/L) and TUR (with an R-2 of 0.80, NSE of 0.81, and MARE of 0.072 and RMSE of 7.82 NTU). The main challenges were data size, sampling frequency, and sampling resolution. To overcome the data limitation, we used a K-fold cross validation technique that could obtain the most out of the limited data to build a robust model. Furthermore, we also employed stratified sampling techniques to improve the ML modeling for turbidity. Thus, this study shows the possibility of monitoring water quality in large freshwater bodies with limited observed data using remote sensing integrated with ML algorithms, potentially enhancing decision making.

TI  - Sensing and imaging of plant disease through the lens of science mapping
T2  - TROPICAL PLANT PATHOLOGY
AB  - Increasing efforts have been made to applying digital farming technologies such as sensing and imaging (S&I) and associated data analysis pipelines to plant pathology and disease management. Although several recent reviews have synthesized and discussed S&I advances in phytopathology, there has been no quantitative investigation of research trends, the evolution of research topics, and publication landscapes in this domain using a structured, bibliometric approach. Here, we applied science mapping-implemented in VOSviewer software-to systematically analyze and visualize scholarly output from journal and proceedings publications (n = 582) in the domain of S&I of plant disease. The publication landscape was dominated by first authors from China, the USA, and Germany, whereby Chinese institutions were among the most prolific publishers (in numbers of articles) and the most collaborative institutions (in terms of link strength in the institutional coauthorship network). Only one disciplinary plant pathology journal was represented among the top-10 journals publishing research in the plant disease S&I domain, with the other top journals focused on sensors and physical processes, precision agriculture, and interdisciplinary plant science. Analysis of term co-occurrence in the literature corpus revealed a term map with four major clusters which were interpreted as research themes corresponding to wheat diseases and associated spectral and correlation indices, aspects of plant physiology, analytical approaches, and data acquisition sources. Temporal overlay visualization applied to the term map showed that articles in the latter two thematic clusters tended to have later publication dates, suggesting that domain knowledge in pathogen biology and plant physiology had to be established first before collaborating with engineers and computer scientists in more recently emerging areas such as machine learning and big data analytics. Our findings illuminate research habits, publication trends, and collaboration patterns and provide a baseline for future research on scientific networks in this interdisciplinary domain.

TI  - Mosquito-Host Interactions during and after an Outbreak of Equine Viral Encephalitis in Eastern Panama
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Mosquito blood meals provide information about the feeding habits and host preference of potential arthropod-borne disease vectors. Although mosquito-borne diseases are ubiquitous in the Neotropics, few studies in this region have assessed patterns of mosquito-host interactions, especially during actual disease outbreaks. Based on collections made during and after an outbreak of equine viral encephalitis, we identified the source of 338 blood meals from 10 species of mosquitoes from Aruza Abajo, a location in Darien province in eastern Panama. A PCR based method targeting three distinct mitochondrial targets and subsequent DNA sequencing was used in an effort to delineate vector-host relationships. At Aruza Abajo, large domesticated mammals dominated the assemblage of mosquito blood meals while wild bird and mammal species represented only a small portion of the blood meal pool. Most mosquito species fed on a variety of hosts; foraging index analysis indicates that eight of nine mosquito species utilize hosts at similar proportions while a stochastic model suggests dietary overlap among species was greater than would be expected by chance. The results from our null-model analysis of mosquito diet overlap are consistent with the hypothesis that in landscapes where large domestic animals dominate the local biomass, many mosquito species show little host specificity, and feed upon hosts in proportion to their biomass, which may have implications for the role of livestocking patterns in vector-borne disease ecology.

TI  - Serosurveillance of Eastern Equine Encephalitis Virus in Amphibians and Reptiles from Alabama, USA
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) is among the most medically important arboviruses in North America, and studies suggest a role for amphibians and reptiles in its transmission cycle. Serum samples collected from 351 amphibians and reptiles (27 species) from Alabama, USA, were tested for the presence of antibodies against EEEV. Frogs, turtles, and lizards showed little or no seropositivity, and snakes had high seropositivity rates. Most seropositive species were preferred or abundant hosts of Culex spp. mosquitoes at Tuskegee National Forest, that target ectothermic hosts. The cottonmouth, the most abundant ectotherm sampled, displayed a high prevalence of seropositivity, indicating its possible role as an amplification and/or over-wintering reservoir for EEEV.

TI  - MAXIMIZING NONHUMAN PRIMATE FECAL SAMPLING IN THE REPUBLIC OF CONGO
T2  - JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE DISEASES
AB  - Techniques for detection of pathogens in wildlife feces allow disease surveillance of species that are difficult to locate and capture (e.g., great apes). However, optimal strategies for detection of feces in logistically challenging environments, such as the forests of Central Africa, have not been developed. We modeled fecal gorilla sampling in the Republic of Congo with computer simulations to explore the performance of different fecal sampling designs in large tropical landscapes. We simulated directed reconnaissance walk (recce) and line-transect distance-sampling survey designs and combinations thereof to maximize the number of fecal samples collected, while also estimating relative ape density on a virtual landscape. We analyzed the performance of different sampling designs across different densities and distributions of ape populations, assessing each for accuracy as well as cost and time efficiencies. Past ape density surveys and fecal deposition rates were used to parameterize the simulated fecal sampling designs. Our results showed that a mixed sampling design that combines traditional transect and a directed reconnaissance sampling design maximized the number of fecal samples collected and estimates of species density. Targeted sampling produced strongly biased estimates of population abundance but maximized efficiency. This research will help design the fecal sampling component of a larger study relating great ape density to Ebola fecal antibody prevalence.

TI  - Fire- and distance-dependent recruitment of the Brazil nut in the Peruvian Amazon
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - The low natural regeneration of the Brazil nut (Bertholletia excelsa) in the Madre de Dios region of Peru is a major concern for the conservation and sustainable use of this species which sustains one of the cornerstone non-timber forest product economies in Amazonia. The Brazil nut is a gap-dependent, long-lived pioneer species that has been shown to regenerate more effectively in fallows than in mature forests. Aside from light and nutrient availability, recruitment success of the species might also be influenced by conspecific negative distance-dependent (CNDD) processes as shown for a myriad of other tropical tree species, but to date has not been studied in the Brazil nut. We measured Brazil nut recruitment in forty 150 x 10 m(2) transects (totaling 6 ha), proportionally laid out in mature forest and fallow land. We found a higher likelihood of regeneration in fallows than in mature forest, which was mainly due to more successful transitioning from seedlings to saplings in fallows. Recruitment rates in fallows increased with the number of fire events occurring over the past 12 years, largely owing to the accumulation of resprouting individuals, but this positive correlation was only observed up to three fire events. We observed CNDD recruitment of the Brazil nut in fallows but not in mature forest, suggesting that pests and diseases might also condition Brazil nut recruitment. Our findings suggest that a better management of fallow land and more controlled use of fire in neighboring land uses could be a cost-effective manner to create Brazil nut rich forests through natural regeneration. On the other hand, the absence of high density Brazil nut stands in mature forests in Madre de Dios might mean that the impact of ancient humans there has been more limited than in other Amazonian regions.

TI  - Pollination specialization and time of pollination on a tropical Venezuelan plain: variations in time and space
T2  - BOTANICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY
AB  - Levels of specialization of the pollination systems were evaluated in 155 plant species from the Venezuelan Central Plain. In all, 29 pollination systems were found, resulting from various combinations of nine pollen-vector types or pollinating agent classes. The number of pollen-vector types composing a pollination system ranged from one to five. Ninety-one species were pollinated by only a single pollen-vector type; the frequency of pollination systems fell monotonically with increasing number of constituent pollen-vector types. Some 30-40 per cent of bee-, moth-, beetle- and bat-pollinated species were pollinated by that group of vectors alone. The highest incidence of co-occurrence between pollen-vector types was found for the combinations fly-wasp, butterfly-wasp, butterfly-fly, and to a lesser extent bird-butterfly, bat-bird, bat-moth and butterfly-moth. The average number of pollen-vector types per plant species was significantly higher for trees and shrubs than for lianas and perennial herbs. The distribution of polyphily, oligophily, monophily and anemophily was significantly associated with life form and habitat. The relative frequencies of these types varied least through the year in the forest-savannah ecotone and in the vegetation as a whole, reflecting the combination of life forms. There were significantly fewer night-pollinated than day-pollinated species. Day-pollinated species tended to be polyphilous, and most of the night-pollinated species were monophilous or oligophilous. Time of pollination activity was related to habitat. The relative importance of night pollination among life forms decreased from trees to perennial herbs. Plant species exclusively pollinated during the night reached a peak during the rainy season (May to November) for trees, lianas and perennial herbs. The data as a whole show that the relative frequency of polyphily, oligophily, monophily and anemophily, and the time of pollination activity are influenced by community structure and plant species richness, and may change from season to season.

TI  - Bats diversity in four towns of coastal area in cordoba department-Colombia
T2  - REVISTA MVZ CORDOBA
AB  - Objective. To contribute to knowledge of bat species diversity in four towns of coastal sub region in Cordoba department. Materials and methods. During the months November and December, 2005 was carried out the investigation of bats community in four towns of the coastal area in Cordoba department. By means of rapid ecological evaluation (REE) methodology, areas with representative forest fragments were chosen of the coastal area, with vegetable formation characteristic of tropical dry forest. Captures of bats were made using mist nets during two consecutive nights in each selected place with a sampling effort of 40 hours/net. Results. 15 species of bat divided in 10 genres and 3 families were registered. The most abundant species was Artibeus jamaicensis with 36,6% of captures, followed by Sturnira lilium and Glossophaga soricina 13,8 and 10,9%, respectively. The presence of Desmodus rotundus species (bat vampire) viral vector of bovine rabies was registered. Conclusions. Data indicated that even the high grade of existent human intervention in the coastal sub-region, and in spite of the homogenization of landscape matrix by effects of extensive livestock, the fragments of studied forests presents an important population of bats that are considered tolerant to habitats with disturbances and open areas, especially of Phyllostomidae family that it was the best represented with 12 species.

TI  - <i>Diospyros perigrena</i> bark extract induced apoptosis in filarial parasite <i>Setaria cervi</i> through generation of reactive oxygen species
T2  - PHARMACEUTICAL BIOLOGY
AB  - Context: Lymphatic filariasis is a major neglected tropical disease. Diospyros perigrena Gurke (Ebenaceae) was selected for antifilarial chemotherapy because of unavailability of proper medicine. In India, different parts of this plant were used for the treatment of diabetes, diarrhea, dysentery, cholera, mouth ulcers, and wounds.
   Objective: The present study was undertaken to access antifilarial potential and mechanism of action of n-butanol extract (NBE) of D. perigrena stem bark on Setaria cervi Rudolphi (Onchocercidae).
   Materials and methods: In vitro efficacy and apoptotic mechanism were evaluated by Hoechst, TUNEL, DNA fragmentation assay, pro-and anti-apoptotic gene expression in NBE (250, 125, 62.5, 31.25, and 15.6 mu g/ml)-treated S. cervi after 24 h of incubation. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) up-regulation was also determined by GSH, GST, SOD assays, and super oxide anion level.
   Results: Significant in vitro antifilarial activity of NBE was found 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50): adult = 57.6 mu g/ml, microfilariae (mf) = 56.1 mu g/ml, and lethal dose (LD100) in mf is 187.17 mu g/ml) after 24 h of treatment. NBF-induced apoptosis was proved by Hoechst, TUNEL, RT-PCR, and Western blot method. NBF (250 mu g/ml) decreased the level of GSH (17.8%) and GST (65.4%), increased SOD activity (1.42-fold) and super oxide anion production (1.32-fold) in the treated parasite which culminated into ROS up-regulation.
   Discussion and conclusion: NBE induced apoptosis in different life cycle stages of S. cervi. In future, a detailed study of NBF will give us a novel antifilarial compound which will be used for antifilarial chemotherapy.

TI  - Ecology and Transmission of Buruli Ulcer Disease: A Systematic Review
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Buruli ulcer is a neglected emerging disease that has recently been reported in some countries as the second most frequent mycobacterial disease in humans after tuberculosis. Cases have been reported from at least 32 countries in Africa (mainly west), Australia, Southeast Asia, China, Central and South America, and the Western Pacific. Large lesions often result in scarring, contractual deformities, amputations, and disabilities, and in Africa, most cases of the disease occur in children between the ages of 4-15 years. This environmental mycobacterium, Mycobacterium ulcerans, is found in communities associated with rivers, swamps, wetlands, and human-linked changes in the aquatic environment, particularly those created as a result of environmental disturbance such as deforestation, dam construction, and agriculture. Buruli ulcer disease is often referred to as the "mysterious disease" because the mode of transmission remains unclear, although several hypotheses have been proposed. The above review reveals that various routes of transmission may occur, varying amongst epidemiological setting and geographic region, and that there may be some role for living agents as reservoirs and as vectors of M. ulcerans, in particular aquatic insects, adult mosquitoes or other biting arthropods. We discuss traditional and non-traditional methods for indicting the roles of living agents as biologically significant reservoirs and/or vectors of pathogens, and suggest an intellectual framework for establishing criteria for transmission. The application of these criteria to the transmission of M. ulcerans presents a significant challenge.

TI  - Post-epizootic microbiome associations across communities of neotropical amphibians
T2  - MOLECULAR ECOLOGY
AB  - Microbiome-pathogen interactions are increasingly recognized as an important element of host immunity. While these host-level interactions will have consequences for community disease dynamics, the factors which influence host microbiomes at larger scales are poorly understood. We here describe landscape-scale pathogen-microbiome associations within the context of post-epizootic amphibian chytridiomycosis, a disease caused by the panzootic chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. We undertook a survey of Neotropical amphibians across altitudinal gradients in Ecuador similar to 30 years following the observed amphibian declines and collected skin swab-samples which were metabarcoded using both fungal (ITS-2) and bacterial (r16S) amplicons. The data revealed marked variation in patterns of both B. dendrobatidis infection and microbiome structure that are associated with host life history. Stream breeding amphibians were most likely to be infected with B. dendrobatidis. This increased probability of infection was further associated with increased abundance and diversity of non-Batrachochytrium chytrid fungi in the skin and environmental microbiome. We also show that increased alpha diversity and the relative abundance of fungi are lower in the skin microbiome of adult stream amphibians compared to adult pond-breeding amphibians, an association not seen for bacteria. Finally, stream tadpoles exhibit lower proportions of predicted protective microbial taxa than pond tadpoles, suggesting reduced biotic resistance. Our analyses show that host breeding ecology strongly shapes pathogen-microbiome associations at a landscape scale, a trait that may influence resilience in the face of emerging infectious diseases.

TI  - Multiple determinants of Australian tropical frog biodiversity
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Distribution data on rainforest frogs within 22 subregions of the Australian Wet Tropics were used to analyse biogeographic patterns in assemblage composition and diversity, and to relate these patterns to environmental factors. The ecological correlates of species richness and spatial patterns of assemblage structure suggested that the patterns of species richness fell into three categories, each being influenced by different processes. The species richness of habitat generalists was largely unaffected by rainforest variables and was primarily related to broad habitat diversity and climate. The spatial patterns of species richness of non-microhylid rainforest frogs were the result of processes associated with historical biogeography, especially extinctions and subsequent recolonisations in those subregions most affected by Quaternary fluctuations in rainforest area. This group of frogs has undergone severe population declines in recent years and the declines represent a significant loss in regional biodiversity since it is this group that produces the majority of regional variability in frog diversity. In contrast, the most significant influence on spatial patterns of microhylid species richness may have been in situ speciation in areas of consistent rainfall, driven by altitudinal gradients, isolation and low dispersal ability. These results stress the necessity of using meaningful and objective groups based on functional ecology in order to understand the determinants of biodiversity: it is not sufficient to examine patterns based purely on species richness within a broad taxonomic group.

TI  - Characterization and evaluation of the enzymatic activity of tetanus toxin submitted to cobalt-60 gamma radiation
T2  - JOURNAL OF VENOMOUS ANIMALS AND TOXINS INCLUDING TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background: Tetanus toxin blocks the release of the inhibitory neurotransmitters in the central nervous system and causes tetanus and its main form of prevention is through vaccination. The vaccine is produced by inactivation of tetanus toxin with formaldehyde, which may cause side effects. An alternative way is the use of ionizing radiation for inactivation of the toxin and also to improve the potential immunogenic response and to reduce the post-vaccination side effects. Therefore, the aim of this study was to characterize the tetanus toxin structure after different doses of ionizing radiation of Co-60.
   Methods: Irradiated and native tetanus toxin was characterized by SDS PAGE in reducing and non-reducing conditions and MALD-TOF. Enzymatic activity was measured by FRET substrate. Also, antigenic properties were assessed by ELISA and Western Blot data.
   Results: Characterization analysis revealed gradual modification on the tetanus toxin structure according to doses increase. Also, fragmentation and possible aggregations of the protein fragments were observed in higher doses. In the analysis of peptide preservation by enzymatic digestion and mass spectrometry, there was a slight modification in the identification up to the dose of 4 kGy. At subsequent doses, peptide identification was minimal. The analysis of the enzymatic activity by fluorescence showed 35 % attenuation in the activity even at higher doses. In the antigenic evaluation, anti-tetanus toxin antibodies were detected against the irradiated toxins at the different doses, with a gradual decrease as the dose increased, but remaining at satisfactory levels.
   Conclusion: Ionizing radiation promoted structural changes in the tetanus toxin such as fragmentation and/or aggregation and attenuation of enzymatic activity as the dose increased, but antigenic recognition of the toxin remained at good levels indicating its possible use as an immunogen. However, studies of enzymatic activity of tetanus toxin irradiated with doses above 8 kGy should be further analyzed.

TI  - New Species and Conservation Status of the Genus Group Scotussae (Orthoptera: Acrididae) in the Atlantic Forest
T2  - NEOTROPICAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - Two new brachypterous species of the genus Scotussa, with restricted distributions, are described for one of the most important and greatly threatened biodiversity hotspots, the Atlantic Forest. These species belong to the genus group Scotussae, a diverse group regarding mobility and oviposition habits. It has been mentioned that these characteristics could lead to restrictions in the species distribution. Based on these antecedents and considering the importance of biodiversity conservation within the Atlantic Forest, we performed novel conservation indices for this group. The rapid assessment indices calculated herein are based upon Red List status, endemism, dispersal capacity, and life-history traits that allowed us to identify areas for conservation for this group of grasshoppers. For a better understanding of the conservation status of the group, the results of the indices were compared with protected areas and Key Biodiversity Areas. Moreover, historical biome stability was also considered since it has been associated with different distributional and diversification patterns within the genus group Scotussae. The approach applied indicates that the indices recovered different but complementary information. The Grasshopper Biotic Index (GBI) determined important regions for conservation within the richest region of the group while the GBI/SiteScore located regions with lower diversity values for the group but with high importance regarding endemisms.

TI  - Serological survey for Chagas disease in the rural areas of Manaus, Coari, and Tefe in the Western Brazilian Amazon
T2  - REVISTA DA SOCIEDADE BRASILEIRA DE MEDICINA TROPICAL
AB  - Introduction: Deforestation, uncontrolled forest, human population migration from endemic areas, and the large number of reservoirs and wild vectors naturally infected by Trypanosoma cruzi promote the endemicity of Chagas disease in the Amazon region. Methods: We conducted an initial serological survey (ELISA) in a sample of 1,263 persons; 1,095 (86.7%) were natives of the state of Amazonas, 666 (52.7%) were male, and 948 (75.1%) were over 20 years old. Serum samples that were found to be reactive, indeterminate, or inconclusive by indirect immunofluorescence (IFI) or positive with low titer by IFA were tested by Western blot (WB). Serologically confirmed patients (WB) were evaluated in terms of epidemiological, clinical, ECG, and echocardiography characteristics. Results: Fifteen patients had serologically confirmed T. cruzi infection, and 12 of them were autochthonous to the state of Amazonas, for an overall seroprevalence of 1.2% and 0.9% for the state of Amazonas. Five of the 15 cases were males, and the average age was 47 years old; most were farmers with low education. One patient who was not autochthonous, having originated from Alagoas, showed right bundle branch block, bundle branch block, and anterosuperior left ventricular systolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 54%. Conclusions: The results of this study ratify the importance of monitoring CD cases in Amazonia, particularly in the state of Amazonas.

TI  - Spatial variations in soil micronutrients as influenced by agro ecological conditions in a tropical humid region
T2  - TROPICAL ECOLOGY
AB  - The continuous and indiscriminate use of NPK fertilizers for boosting productivity in the farming sector longer periods resulted in the imbalance of soil nutrients in the long run. This nutrient disparity in soil gradually throw back in crops, animals and human beings, leading to various degenerative and deficiency related diseases now more than ever. This constrained site specific nutrient management for crops, which essentially rely upon evaluation of variability spatially and temporarily. In this study we scrutinized the spatial variation of soil fertility in exhaustive plough lands of Thrissur district, Kerala, India. A total of 600 geo referred soil samples were collected from different agroecological units of the district and examined for selected micronutrients such as Fe, Cu, Mn, Zn and B. Geo-statistical mapping tool (Arc GIS10.2.2) was used to quantify the degree of spatial variability in various soil fertility parameters. The spatial variation of nutrients in the study area was assessed by using semivariogram method in kriging interpolation and spatial dependence was calculated. The best fit model was applied to the kriging interpolation according to the determination coefficient, which is the correlation of measured and predicted values on space and spatial distribution maps of all the micronutrients. Among the variables analyzed, B revealed strong spatial dependence (24%), Zn with weak spatial dependence (78%) with model gaussian and others with moderate spatial dependence. The results from the present study call to develop a strategy for site-specific management for the parameters showing moderate spatial dependence and weak spatial dependence. But for B, showing strong spatial dependence, only uniform management is needed because it was greatly affected by the structural factors such as climate, topography and parent material. Spatial variability of soil properties is essential for precision agriculture because soil parameters with little or no spatial dependence will not be conducive to site-specific management, and will be managed on the average level only.

TI  - Rarity or decline: Key concepts for the Red List of Australian eucalypts
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - The 822 eucalypt species (Angophora, Corymbia, Eucalyptus) within Australia were assessed using IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria. Overall, 193 (23%) eucalypts qualified as threatened and 36 were considered Data Deficient. One hundred and thirty-four threatened species qualified under criterion A2, representing a past and irreversible population decline of > 30%. The remainder were narrow-range species with ongoing threats (mostly mining or urbanisation), or naturally rare. Habitat conversion to crops and pastures was the cause of decline for most threatened eucalypts. Threatened species were concentrated where deforestation and high eucalypt richness coincide, especially south-western Western Australia. Corymbia or Angophora species, and relatively few tropical eucalypts are threatened. Fire, timber harvesting and disease were rarely sufficient threats to eucalypts to warrant a threatened status. Sheep grazing limits regeneration in temperate woodlands, but requires further quantification for individual species. Prior to this study, 89 eucalypts were listed as threatened under Australian environmental law. This assessment recommends that 32 of these species be downgraded to Near Threatened or Least Concern. A further 11 species were identified as Data Deficient, while an additional 147 species were proposed for listing as threatened. This systematic assessment of Australian eucalypts emphasises the importance of decline rather than rarity when compared with previous listings, with broad implications for listing long-lived plants in deforested landscapes.

TI  - Review of rice-fish-farming systems in China - One of the Globally Important Ingenious Agricultural Heritage Systems (GIAHS)
T2  - AQUACULTURE
AB  - Rice-fish-farming systems constitute a unique agro-landscape across the world, especially in tropical and sub-tropical Asia. Rice is a globally important staple food crop, with a wide distribution and constituting diversified varieties. The introduction of fish rearing to rice farming creates an integrated agro-ecological system. China boasts a history of 1700 years in rice-fish-farming practice. It is no longer a sole agro-production practice, but an agro-cultural pattern. Therefore, it has been listed by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) as one of the Globally Important Ingenious Agricultural Heritage Systems (GIAHS). Qingtian County of the Zhejiang province has been selected as a pilot conservation site. The rice-fish-farming systems in China diversify China's agro-landscape and favor the conservation of species variety of both rice and fish. The survival of deep-water rice, an indigenous rice variety, and Oujiang red carp, an indigenous fish variety, are cases in point. Being low external input systems, the rice-fish-farming systems necessitate only small amounts of pesticide and fertilizer. The application of pesticides can be lowered to 50% of that of modem, high-input rice production; sometimes, no pesticide application is required. The natural enemies of rice pests show a prominent rise, making the bio-control of rice diseases and pests highly feasible. The rice-fish-farming system is also of great significance in global food security and global change. It provides food and animal protein for subsistence farmers living in ecologically-fragile mountainous regions. It also reduces economic risks that these farmers potentially face. The nitrogen-fixation role of the system increased the content of organic matter, total nitrogen and total phosphorus in the soil by 15.6-38.5%. It also reduces the emission of CH4 by nearly 30% compared with traditional rice farming. However, the economical development and industrialization in China pose a threat to rice-fish farming and, consequently, the numbers of farmers involved in rice-fish farming are decreasing. This calls for the Chinese government to engage itself in the conservation and development of this system and to innovate the existing technologies. It would also be useful, in the meantime, to exploit and conserve rice-fish farming as eco-tourism resources, so that the income of the mountainous farmers can be increased and this important, indigenous agro-culture be conserved and developed.

TI  - First identification of <i>Rickettsia helvetica</i> in questing ticks from a French Northern Brittany Forest
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Tick-borne rickettsiae are considered to be emerging, but data about their presence in western Europe are scarce. Ixodes ricinus ticks, the most abundant and widespread tick species in western Europe, were collected and tested for the presence of several tick-borne pathogens in western France, a region never previously explored in this context. There was a high tick abundance with a mean of 4 females, 4.5 males, and 23.3 nymphs collected per hour per collector. Out of 622 tested ticks, specific PCR amplification showed the presence of tick symbionts as well as low prevalence of Borrelia burgdorferi (0.8%), Bartonella spp. (0.17%), and Anaplasma phagocytophilum (0.09%). The most prevalent pathogen was Rickettsia helvetica (4.17%). This is the first time that this bacteria has been detected in ticks in this region, and this result raises the possibility that bacteria other than those classically implicated may be involved in rickettsial diseases in western France.

TI  - KNOWLEDGE AND PRACTICES REGARDING MALARIA AND ITS PREVENTION AND THEIR ASSOCIATED SOCIO-DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS AMONG THOSE LIVING ALONG THE THAILAND-MYANMAR BORDER
T2  - SOUTHEAST ASIAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - There are malaria case clusters in Thailand along the Thailand-Myanmar border. In this study, we aimed to compare the knowledge and practices regarding malaria and its prevention and their associated socio-demographic factors between those who entered the forest (forest goers) and those who did not (non-forest goers) among those living in Thailand along the Thailand-Myanmar border in order to inform efforts to reduce malaria clusters in this study population. The study consisted of 2 parts: a questionnaire survey and in-depth interviews. The inclusion criteria for questionnaire survey study subjects were: living in a study village during the study period, being able and willing to participate in the study and being aged > 13 years. Inclusion criteria for in-depth interview subjects were: the same criteria as the questionnaire survey but subjects must be aged >= 18 years. Exclusion criteria for both the questionnaire survey and the in-depth interview subjects were being unable or unwilling to communicate with the researchers. Study subjects for the questionnaire survey were randomly selected from those living in two study villages in Tak Province, Thailand. Study subjects for the in-depth interviews were purposively selectively chosen based on their representation of groups in villages. The 2 parts of the study were conducted during March-April 2019. The minimum number of study subjects calculated to be needed for the questionnaire survey was 369. The minimum number of subjects chosen for in-depth interviews was 30 in order to represent 6 groups of people in the study population: housewives, leaders, the elderly, the youth, forest goers and non-forest goers. A total of 385 subjects were included in the questionnaire survey, 40.8% male, and 30 subjects were included in the in-depth interviews, 56.6% male. The mean (+/- standard deviation) age of questionnaire study subjects was 36.2 (+/- 16.7) (range: 13-95) years and of in-depth interview subjects was 43 (+/- 18) (range: 18-78) years. Among questionnaire subjects, 50.3% were forest-goers and among interview subjects 60.0% were forest-goers. About three-fourth (76.8%) of questionnaire forest-goers knew malaria mosquito biting times versus 90.6% of non-forest-goers (p= 0.001). Almost all (97.4%) of forest-goers believed malaria is curable versus 78.5% of non-forest-goers (p= 0.001). Almost half (45.4%) of forest -goers believed malaria was transmitted by drinking mosquito larvae contaminated drinking water versus 31.4% of non-forest-goers (p=0.003). Of the forest-goers, 22.8% believed malaria mosquitoes bite all day long versus 9.4% of non-forest goers (p < 0.001). Forest-goers stated they did not take any mosquito bite preventive measures 53.7% of the time versus 16.2% of the time among non-forest goers (p < 0.001). Bed nets were used by forest -goers 30.1% of the time and by non-forest-goers 78.5% of the time (p < 0.001). About half (50.5%) of forest-goers had a good knowledge about malaria versus 38.2% of non-forest-goers (p=0.272). The only socio-demographic factor significantly positively associated with better preventive practices was being ethnic Karen (p=0.046). Malaria knowledge level was not significantly associated with preventive practices. Among interview subjects, the reason given for not using bed-or hammock-nets among forest-goers was the inconvenience of carrying them into the forest. Most forest goers used other methods to prevent mosquito bites, such as wearing long sleeve shirts and planting mosquito repellant plants.
   In summary, we found forest-goers had a greater knowledge about malaria but poor practices regarding malaria prevention. We conclude there are other factors besides knowledge that cause forest-goers to have poorer practices. These need to be determined in order to develop interventions to improve preventive practices in the study population. Further studies are needed to determine the cause of the disconnect between knowledge and practices in the study population.

TI  - Ecology and larval population dynamics of the primary malaria vector <i>Nyssorhynchus darlingi</i> in a high transmission setting dominated by fish farming in western Amazonian Brazil
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Vale do Rio Jurua in western Acre, Brazil, is a persistent malaria transmission hotspot partly due to fish farming development that was encouraged to improve local standards of living. Fish ponds can be productive breeding sites for Amazonian malaria vector species, including Nyssorhynchus darlingi, which, combined with high human density and mobility, add to the local malaria burden.This study reports entomological profile of immature and adult Ny. darlingi at three sites in Mancio Lima, Acre, during the rainy and dry season (February to September, 2017). From 63 fishponds, 10,859 larvae were collected, including 5,512 first-instar Anophelinae larvae and 4,927 second, third and fourth-instars, of which 8.5% (n = 420) were Ny. darlingi. This species was most abundant in not-abandoned fishponds and in the presence of emerging aquatic vegetation. Seasonal analysis of immatures in urban landscapes found no significant difference in the numbers of Ny. darlingi, corresponding to equivalent population density during the rainy to dry transition period. However, in the rural landscape, significantly higher numbers of Ny. darlingi larvae were collected in August (IRR = 5.80, p = 0.037) and September (IRR = 6.62, p = 0.023) (dry season), compared to February (rainy season), suggesting important role of fishponds for vector population maintenance during the seasonal transition in this landscape type. Adult sampling detected mainly Ny. darlingi (similar to 93%), with similar outdoor feeding behavior, but different abundance according to landscape profile: urban site 1 showed higher peaks of human biting rate in May (46 bites/person/hour), than February (4) and September (15), while rural site 3 shows similar HBR during the same sampling period (22, 24 and 21, respectively). This study contributes to a better understanding of the larvae biology of the main malaria vector in the Vale do Rio Jurua region and, ultimately will support vector control efforts.

TI  - The use of geotechnologies for the identification of the urban flora in the city of Teresina, Brazil
T2  - URBAN ECOSYSTEMS
AB  - Urban greenness is an element of vital importance for the population quality of life, and forest inventory is considered the most appropriate method for its assessment. Remote sensing has become an attractive alternative for the accomplishment of forest inventory, facilitating urban flora mapping. The present study aimed to identify the main species of trees in Teresina, Piaui, and evaluate the botanical identification accuracy by using high-resolution satellite images (Worldview-2) as compared to on-site inventory. We used the e-Cognition 8.7 software for the mapping, segmentation, and classification of the vegetal species and ERDAS Imagine 9.2 for accuracy verification. The NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) was used to analyze the natural vegetation condition. The outskirts of the city presented higher values of NDVI. An amount of 1,392 individuals from 53 species and 28 families, were identified. Among these, the families Anacardiaceae (20.7%), Fabaceae (19.8%), Meliaceae (9.4%), Myrtaceae (6.9%), Arecaceae (6.1%), and Combretaceae (5.5%) were the most prevalent. Amongst the 53 species identified, the 16 most abundant were chosen for the analysis. The classification had a satisfactory result for the 16 vegetal species with a general classification accuracy of 69.43% and a kappa agreement index of 0,68. The species that obtained the highest accuracy were Ficus benjamin (87,5%), Terminalia cattapa (83,3%), Syzygium malaccense (82,4%), Mangifera indica (76,8%), Caesalpinia ferrea (75,9%), Pachira aquatica (73,9%), and Tabebuia sp (75,9%). The results showed that it is feasible, although challenging, to classify biodiverse vegetation in an urban environment using high-resolution satellite images. Our findings support the use of geotechnologies for inventorying urban forest in tropical cities.

TI  - Essential Oils from Different Myrtaceae Species from Brazilian Atlantic Forest Biome - Chemical Dereplication and Evaluation of Antitrypanosomal Activity
T2  - CHEMISTRY & BIODIVERSITY
AB  - Chagas Disease (CD), caused by flagellate protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, is a Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTD) that affect approximately seven million people worldwide with a restrict therapeutical arsenal. In the present study, the essential oils from 18 Myrtaceae species were extracted, chemically dereplicated, and evaluated in vitro against T. cruzi. From these, eight essential oils were considered promising (IC(50)10) against the protozoan: Eugenia florida, E. acutata, E. widgrenii, Calyptranthes brasilienses, C. widgreniana, Plinia cauliflora, Campomanesia xanthocarpa, and Psidium guajava. Multivariate data analysis pointed out (E)-caryophyllene, alpha-humulene, limonene, caryophyllene oxide, and alpha-copaene playing an important role in the anti-T. cruzi activity. The obtained results demonstrated the potential of essential oils of Myrtaceae species as valuable sources of bioactive compounds against T. cruzi.

TI  - Using an Azure Machine Learning Approach for Flexible Pavement Maintenance
T2  - 2020 16TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL COLLOQUIUM ON SIGNAL PROCESSING & ITS APPLICATIONS (CSPA 2020)
CP  - 16th IEEE International Colloquium on Signal Processing and its Applications (CSPA)
AB  - Machine learning (ML) is one of the intelligent methodologies that has shown promising results in the domains of classification and prediction. In this paper, Azure Machine Learning (AML) systems were applied for flexible pavement maintenance classification problems and solutions. For prediction, four parameters were used as the inputs namely severity, density, road functional, and average daily traffic (ADT) while the output parameters were treatment techniques. This paper provides a critical analysis of classification algorithms: two-class support vector machine, multi-class decision forest, and multi-class neural network. Characteristic significance analysis was carried out to investigate how each classifier utilized the information available in the dataset, focusing on the application of azure machine learning classification (AMLC) to the pavement maintenances results prediction. Overall, the findings showed that predictions using Multi-Class Neural Network (MCNN) were obtaining an accuracy of 0.99. The results indicated that prediction obtained from AML training seemed to be more powerful, with a smaller standard error. Azure ML technique showed high accuracy with satisfactory results and capability of predicting pavement maintenance rigorously.

TI  - Ecology of mosquitoes in areas of the National Park of "Serra da Bocaina", Brazil.: II -: Monthly frequency and climatic factors
T2  - REVISTA DE SAUDE PUBLICA
AB  - Objective To establish the influence of climatic factors on the monthly frequency of mosquito fauna in areas of the National Park of Serra da Bocaina, Brazil.
   Methods Human bait collections were conducted once a month, in diurnal and nocturnal hours, throughout 24 months, from January 1991 to December 1992.
   Results A total of 11,808 adult mosquitoes belonging to 28 different species were collected. Anopheles cruzii, Runchomyia reversa, and Ru. frontosa were the most commonly found species each month. An. cruzii was found mostly,from October to February; Ru. reversa and Ru. frontosa predominated in September An. lutzi, Chagasia fajardoi, Coquillettidia chrysonotum, Aedes serratus, Trichoprosopon simile, Wyeomyia theobaldi, Ru. humboldti, and Ru. theobaldi are the second most prevalent species and they were found mostly throughout the hottest, rainiest and most humid months. Temperature and rainfall have positively influenced the incidence of the majority of the species.
   Conclusions The exuberant and well-preserved tropical forest of Alata Atlantica, rainfalls, and temperatures had a direct and significant contribution to the mosquito fauna in the park. In the months with greater rainfalls, temperatures and humidity, there was an increase in the density and diversity, of mosquito species. The period from September to March was the most favorable for their proliferation. In the colder and drier period, from April to August, about 70% of the species showed a significant decline in number, and they were hardly found during these months.

TI  - Interaction between MHC diversity and constitution, gut microbiota and Astrovirus infections in a neotropical bat
T2  - MOLECULAR ECOLOGY
AB  - Astroviruses (AstVs) infect numerous mammalian species including reservoirs such as bats. Peptides encoded by the genes of the highly polymorphic Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) form the first line of host defence against pathogens. Aside from direct involvement in mounting adaptive immune responses, MHC class II genes are hypothesized to regulate gut commensal diversity and shape the production of immune-modulatory substances by microbes, indirectly affecting host susceptibility. Despite initial empirical evidence for the link between host MHC and the microbiota, associations among these factors remain largely unknown. To fill this gap, we examined MHC allelic diversity and constitution, the gut bacterial community and abundance pattern of a wild population of a neotropical bat (Artibeus jamaicensis) challenged by AstV infections. First, we show an age-dependent relationship between the host MHC class II diversity and constitution and the gut microbiota in AstV-uninfected bats. Crucially, these associations changed in AstV-infected bats. Additionally, we identify changes in the abundance of specific bacterial taxa linked to the presence of certain MHC supertypes and AstV infection. We suggest changes in the microbiota to be either a result of AstV infection or the MHC-mediated modulation of microbial communities. The latter could subsequently affect microbe-mediated immunity and resistance against AstV infection. Our results emphasize that the reciprocal nature of host immune genetics, gut microbial diversity and pathogen infection require attention, which are particularly important given their repercussions for disease susceptibility and severity in wild animal populations with a history of zoonotic spillover and frequent human contact.

TI  - Nasopharyngeal Microbiota Profiles in Rural Venezuelan Children Are Associated With Respiratory and Gastrointestinal Infections
T2  - CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB  - Background. Recent research suggests that the microbiota affects susceptibility to both respiratory tract infections (RTIs) and gastrointestinal infections (GIIs). In order to optimize global treatment options, it is important to characterize microbiota profiles across different niches and geographic/socioeconomic areas where RTI and GII prevalences are high.
   Methods. We performed 16S sequencing of nasopharyngeal swabs from 209 Venezuelan Amerindian children aged 6 weeks-59 months who were participating in a 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) study. Using random forest models, differential abundance testing, and regression analysis, we determined whether specific bacteria were associated with RTIs or GIIs and variation in PCV13 response.
   Results. Microbiota compositions differed between children with or without RTIs (P = .018) or GIIs (P = .001). Several species were associated with the absence of infections. Some of these health-associated bacteria are also observed in developed regions, such as Corynebacterium (log2(fold change [FC]) = 3.30 for RTIs and log2(FC) = 1.71 for GIIs), while others are not commonly observed in developed regions, such as Acinetobacter (log2(FC) = 2.82 and log2(FC) = 5.06, respectively). Klebsiella spp. presence was associated with both RTIs (log2(FC) = 5.48) and GIIs (log2(FC) = 7.20).
   Conclusions. The nasopharyngeal microbiota of rural Venezuelan children included several bacteria that thrive in tropical humid climates. Interestingly, nasopharyngeal microbiota composition not only differed in children with an RTI but also in those with a GII, which suggests a reciprocal interplay between the 2 environments. Knowledge of region-specific microbiota patterns enables tailoring of preventive and therapeutic approaches.

TI  - Host Biology and Anthropogenic Factors Affect Hepadnavirus Infection in a Neotropical Bat
T2  - ECOHEALTH
AB  - The tent-making bat hepatitis B virus (TBHBV) is a hepadnavirus closely related to human hepatitis B virus. The ecology of TBHBV is unclear. We show that it is widespread and highly diversified in Peters' tent-making bats (Uroderma bilobatum) within Panama, while local prevalence varied significantly between sample sites, ranging from 0 to 14.3%. Females showed significantly higher prevalence than males, and pregnant females were more often acutely infected than non-reproductive ones. The distribution of TBHBV in bats was significantly affected by forest cover, with higher infection rates in areas with lower forest cover. Our data indicate that loss of natural habitat may lead to positive feedback on the biotic factors driving infection possibility. These results underline the necessity of multidisciplinary studies for a better understanding of mechanisms in pathogen-host relationships and for predictions in disease ecology.

TI  - Macroeconomic change, competitiveness and timber production: A five-country comparison
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - This study analyzes how long-run macroeconomic fluctuations have affected timber production levels in five tropical oil-producing countries: Gabon. Cameroon, Papua New Guinea (PNG), Venezuela, and Ecuador. The core hypothesis is that oil booms. foreign borrowing, and other major foreign exchange inflows slow down timber harvesting. These inflows cause "Dutch Disease," depressing the price competitiveness of timber exports and other trade-exposed sectors. A qualitative examination of long-run trends in the five countries is combined with simple econometrics. The findings confirm a strong impact of competitiveness on logging. Substantial real currency devaluation can greatly accelerate timber exports. Yet. in middle-income countries with strongly expanding domestic timber markets (Ecuador. Cameroon. Venezuela), home-market demand also rises much with urban incomes and population. When full or partial import protection occurs, this translates into rising domestic production. The relative weight of these two potentially significant factors varies widely, so policies to influence extraction levels need to be tailored accordingly. (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Slag consists mostly of mixed oxides of elements such as silicon, and recycled slag may be used for cultivating. The relationship between slag fertilization and plant growth rate can be expected to change depending on the volume of slag applied. Quantifying the chlorophyll content, an effective indicator of disease as well as nutritional and environmental stresses on plants, will enable optimal slag fertilization and then monitoring chlorophyll content using field measurements would enable the determination of optimal slag fertilization rates. In this study, radish plants (Raphanus sativus L), which belongs to the family Brassicaceae and is popular root vegetable in both tropical and temperate regions, were cultivated with slag fertilization and the potential use of hyperspectral reflectance was evaluated. Some preprocessing techniques were effective for retrieving chlorophyll contents in radish leaves from hyperspectral reflectance and then the regression model based on random forest and continuum-removed reflectance had the highest performance with a root mean square error of 5.141 mu g cm(-2) and RPD values of 1.858 for the test data set.

TI  - Evaluation of Ornamental Tropical Plants for Resistance to White Mold Caused by <i>Sclerotinia sclerotiorum</i>
T2  - HORTSCIENCE
AB  - Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Lib.) de Bary is a fungal pathogen that causes stem rot, crown rot, wilt, and death of many common annual flowering plants. Infested flower beds often suffer significant plant loss each year, and the identification of disease resistant plants would be a useful management tool. Caladium (Caladium xhortulanum Birdsey), canna (Cannaxgeneralis L.H. Bailey), and elephant ear [Colocasia esculenta (L.) Schott] were evaluated for potential resistance to S. sclerotiorum. Plants grown in field conditions in Minnesota in 2012 and 2013 were inoculated through the application of sorghum grains colonized by S. sclerotiorum. The number of plants infected and percent of canopy dieback were recorded weekly for 3 months. The susceptibility of leaves, flowers, and below ground storage organs was also examined through direct inoculation of plant tissue with a mycelial plug of the pathogen in controlled environmental conditions favorable for disease development. Symptoms and progression of the infection were recorded after 24 days. Symptoms of infection on all three species were similar in field and controlled environments. Caladium plants were susceptible to S. sclerotiorum. Petioles, leaves, and corms developed a watery soft rot. Elephant ear was highly resistant to infection. Sclerotinia sclerotiorum infected only wounded or senescent tissue and did not result in significant symptoms under any conditions. Canna had partial resistance to the pathogen. Although canna petals were readily infected, infection of petioles was restricted to small necrotic lesions. Neither infection progressed to the main stem or resulted in plant death. This study indicates that canna and elephant ear have resistance to S. sclerotiorum and could be used in an integrated disease management program for infested landscape beds.

TI  - Rift Valley Fever Virus Circulating among Ruminants, Mosquitoes and Humans in the Central African Republic
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) causes a viral zoonosis, with discontinuous epizootics and sporadic epidemics, essentially in East Africa. Infection with this virus causes severe illness and abortion in sheep, goats, and cattle as well as other domestic animals. Humans can also be exposed through close contact with infectious tissues or by bites from infected mosquitoes, primarily of the Aedes and Culex genuses. Although the cycle of RVFV infection in savannah regions is well documented, its distribution in forest areas in central Africa has been poorly investigated.
   Methodology/Principal Findings
   To evaluate current circulation of RVFV among livestock and humans living in the Central African Republic (CAR), blood samples were collected from sheep, cattle, and goats and from people at risk, such as stock breeders and workers in slaughterhouses and livestock markets. The samples were tested for anti-RVFV immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies. We also sequenced the complete genomes of two local strains, one isolated in 1969 from mosquitoes and one isolated in 1985 from humans living in forested areas. The 1271 animals sampled comprised 727 cattle, 325 sheep, and 219 goats at three sites. The overall seroprevalence of anti-RVFV IgM antibodies was 1.9% and that of IgG antibodies was 8.6%. IgM antibodies were found only during the rainy season, but the frequency of IgG antibodies did not differ significantly by season. No evidence of recent RVFV infection was found in 335 people considered at risk; however, 16.7% had evidence of past infection. Comparison of the nucleotide sequences of the strains isolated in the CAR with those isolated in other African countries showed that they belonged to the East/Central African cluster.
   Conclusion and significance
   This study confirms current circulation of RVFV in CAR. Further studies are needed to determine the potential vectors involved and the virus reservoirs.

TI  - Machine learning and dengue forecasting: Comparing random forests and artificial neural networks for predicting dengue burden at national and sub-national scales in Colombia
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - The robust estimate and forecast capability of random forests (RF) has been widely recognized, however this ensemble machine learning method has not been widely used in mosquito-borne disease forecasting. In this study, two sets of RF models were developed at the national (pooled department-level data) and department level in Colombia to predict weekly dengue cases for 12-weeks ahead. A pooled national model based on artificial neural networks (ANN) was also developed and used as a comparator to the RF models. The various predictors included historic dengue cases, satellite-derived estimates for vegetation, precipitation, and air temperature, as well as population counts, income inequality, and education. Our RF model trained on the pooled national data was more accurate for department-specific weekly dengue cases estimation compared to a local model trained only on the department's data. Additionally, the forecast errors of the national RF model were smaller to those of the national pooled ANN model and were increased with the forecast horizon increasing from one-week-ahead (mean absolute error, MAE: 9.32) to 12-weeks ahead (MAE: 24.56). There was considerable variation in the relative importance of predictors dependent on forecast horizon. The environmental and meteorological predictors were relatively important for short-term dengue forecast horizons while socio-demographic predictors were relevant for longer-term forecast horizons. This study demonstrates the potential of RF in dengue forecasting with a feasible approach of using a national pooled model to forecast at finer spatial scales. Furthermore, including sociodemographic predictors is likely to be helpful in capturing longer-term dengue trends.
   Author summary Dengue virus has the highest disease burden of all mosquito-borne viral diseases, infecting 390 million people annually in 128 countries. Forecasting is an important warning mechanism that can help with proactive planning and response for clinical and public health services. In this study, we compare two different machine learning approaches to dengue forecasting: random forest (RF) and artificial neural networks (ANN). National (pooling across all departments) and local (department-specific) models were compared and used to predict future dengue cases in Colombia. In Colombia, the departments are administrative divisions formed by a grouping of municipalities. The results demonstrated that the counts of future dengue cases were more accurately estimated by RF than by ANN. It was also shown that environmental and meteorological predictors were more important for forecast accuracy for shorter-term forecasts while socio-demographic predictors were more important for longer-term forecasts. Finally, the national pooled model applied to local data was more accurate in dengue forecasting compared to the department-specific model. This research contributes to the field of disease forecasting and highlights different considerations for future forecasting studies.

TI  - Endemic Ecuadorian glassfrog <i>Cochranella mache</i> is Critically Endangered because of habitat loss
T2  - ORYX
AB  - Amphibians are one of the most threatened animal groups. In the Family Centrolenidae c. 50% of the species are declining and threatened with extinction. One of these is the glassfrog Cochranella mache, endemic to seasonal evergreen forests of the West Ecuadorian region and restricted to highly fragmented forest of < 100 km(2) in the Cordillera Mache-Chindul, north-western coastal Ecuador, at 100-640 m. We surveyed this region to elucidate the distribution and conservation status of C. mache. We located it in three new localities and also found a museum specimen from a further new locality. We recommend that the species should be categorized as Critically Endangered because of the continuous and progressive destruction of its increasingly fragmented habitat. Recent surveys of glassfrog species sympatric with C. mache showed low relative abundances compared to surveys in the 1970s and 1980s. Because of the relationship between forest and local climate we suggest that gradual declines of lowland glassfrog populations may be caused by local climate changes produced by forest destruction. In situ conservation is required to halt and mitigate these impacts. Further research on the effects of habitat loss, fragmentation, and associated climate changes on Neotropical amphibians is required.

TI  - Geographic Variation in the Relationship between Human Lyme Disease Incidence and Density of Infected Host-Seeking <i>Ixodes scapularis</i> Nymphs in the Eastern United States
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Prevention and control of Lyme disease is difficult because of the complex biology of the pathogen's (Borrelia burgdorferi) vector (Ixocles scapularis) and multiple reservoir hosts with varying degrees of competence. Cost-effective implementation of tick- and host-targeted control methods requires an understanding of the relationship between pathogen prevalence in nymphs, nymph abundance, and incidence of human cases of Lyme disease. We quantified the relationship between estimated acarological risk and human incidence using county-level human case data and nymphal prevalence data from field-derived estimates in 36 eastern states. The estimated density of infected nymphs (mDIN) was significantly correlated with human incidence (r = 0.69). The relationship was strongest in high-prevalence areas, but it varied by region and state, partly because of the distribution of B. burgdorferi genotypes. More information is needed in several high-prevalence states before DIN can be used for cost-effectiveness analyses.

TI  - The stingless bees (Hymenoptera: Apidae: Meliponini): a review of the current threats to their survival
T2  - APIDOLOGIE
AB  - Pollination by insects is an essential service for the conservation of plant biodiversity, since it increases the rate of fertilization of flowers and therefore increases the quality and quantity of seeds and fruits. In tropical regions, native plants depend heavily on stingless bees as pollinators since before the introduction of the European honey bee Apis mellifera. However, like for many other insect species worldwide, anthropogenic actions represent a true threat to stingless bee populations. In this article, we review the works that evaluated the potential negative impacts of human activities on populations of stingless bees. The studies constitute a strong body of evidence that stingless bee populations are at risk of decline around the world due to threats including habitat loss, agrochemicals, competition for resources, climate change, and the introduction of exotic species, including pathogens.

TI  - Amphibian and reptile declines over 35 years at La Selva, Costa Rica
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
AB  - Amphibians stand at the forefront of a global biodiversity crisis. More than one-third of amphibian species are globally threatened, and over 120 species have likely suffered global extinction since 1980. Most alarmingly, many rapid declines and extinctions are occurring in pristine sites lacking obvious adverse effects of human activities. The causes of these "enigmatic" declines remain highly contested. Still, lack of long-term data on amphibian populations severely limits our understanding of the distribution of amphibian declines, and therefore the ultimate causes of these declines. Here, we identify a systematic community-wide decline in populations of terrestrial amphibians at La Selva Biological Station, a protected old-growth lowland rainforest in lower Central America. We use data collected over 35 years to show that population density of all species of terrestrial amphibians has declined by approximate to 75% since 1970, and we show identical trends for all species of common reptiles. The trends we identify are neither consistent with recent emergence of chytridiomycosis nor the climate-linked epidemic hypothesis, two leading putative causes of enigmatic amphibian declines. Instead, our data suggest that declines are due to climate-driven reductions in the quantity of standing leaf litter, a critical micro-habitat for amphibians and reptiles in this assemblage. Our results raise further concerns about the global persistence of amphibian populations by identifying widespread declines in species and habitats that are not currently recognized as susceptible to such risks.

TI  - Sand Fly Associated Phlebovirus with Evidence of Neutralizing Antibodies in Humans, Kenya
T2  - EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB  - We describe a novel virus, designated Ntepes virus (NPV), isolated from sand flies in Kenya. NPV has the characteristic phlebovirus trisegmented genome architecture and is related to, but distinct from, Gabek Forest phlebovirus. Diverse cell cultures derived from wildlife, livestock, and humans were susceptible to NPV, with pronounced permissiveness in swine and rodent cells. NPV infection of newborn mice caused rapid and fatal illness. Permissiveness for NPV replication in sand fly cells, but not mosquito cells, suggests a vector-specific adaptation. Specific neutralizing antibodies were found in 13.9% (26/187) of human serum samples taken at the site of isolation of NPV as well as a disparate site in northeastern Kenya, suggesting a wide distribution. We identify a novel human-infecting arbovirus and highlight the importance of rural areas in tropical Africa for arbovirus surveillance as well as extending arbovirus surveillance to include hematophagous arthropods other than mosquitoes.

TI  - Persisting arthralgia due to Mayaro virus infection in a traveler from Brazil: Is there a risk for attendants to the 2014 FIFA World Cup?
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL VIROLOGY
AB  - The 2014 FIFA World Cup and the 2016 Olympic Games will attract large groups of visitors to Brazil. These visitors will be at risk for different arboviral infections, some of which not well known outside endemic areas. We report a case of a 52-year-old Dutch woman who presented with persistent arthralgia due to a Mayaro virus (MAW) infection which she contracted in the Amazon basin in Brazil. MAW is a mosquitoborne alphavirus which primarily circulates in humid tropical forests of South America. Infections are rarely reported in travelers and are characterized by an acute febrile illness which is often followed by a prolonged and sometimes incapacitating polyarthralgia. Both travelers and physicians should be aware of the risk of these arboviral infections and the importance of mosquito bite prevention should be stressed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Evaluation and Modelling of Reference Evapotranspiration Using Different Machine Learning Techniques for a Brazilian Tropical Savanna
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
AB  - Meteorological elements can affect the environment and cultures differently and may alter the natural development process contributing significantly to climate change. Meteorological variables of the Brazilian Pantanal were studied and used to determine evapotranspiration with fewer variables. It was found that artificial intelligence can substantially improve environmental modeling when alternative prediction techniques are used, resulting in lower project costs and more reliable results. This work tried to find the best combination by comparing machine learning techniques such as artificial neural networks, random forests, and support vector machines. A new model was created that depends on fewer climatic variables compared to the Penman-Monteith method (the standard method for estimating reference evapotranspiration) and can efficiently describe the reference evapotranspiration. Machine learning techniques are highly efficient for modeling environmental systems since they can process large amounts of data and find the best interactions between the parameters involved. In addition, more than 98% accuracy was obtained using fewer variables compared to the standard method when artificial neural networks are utilized.

TI  - The P323L substitution in the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase (NSP12) confers a selective advantage during infection
T2  - GENOME BIOLOGY
AB  - BackgroundThe mutational landscape of SARS-CoV-2 varies at the dominant viral genome sequence and minor genomic variant population. During the COVID-19 pandemic, an early substitution in the genome was the D614G change in the spike protein, associated with an increase in transmissibility. Genomes with D614G are accompanied by a P323L substitution in the viral polymerase (NSP12). However, P323L is not thought to be under strong selective pressure.ResultsInvestigation of P323L/D614G substitutions in the population shows rapid emergence during the containment phase and early surge phase during the first wave. These substitutions emerge from minor genomic variants which become dominant viral genome sequence. This is investigated in vivo and in vitro using SARS-CoV-2 with P323 and D614 in the dominant genome sequence and L323 and G614 in the minor variant population. During infection, there is rapid selection of L323 into the dominant viral genome sequence but not G614. Reverse genetics is used to create two viruses (either P323 or L323) with the same genetic background. L323 shows greater abundance of viral RNA and proteins and a smaller plaque morphology than P323.ConclusionsThese data suggest that P323L is an important contribution in the emergence of variants with transmission advantages. Sequence analysis of viral populations suggests it may be possible to predict the emergence of a new variant based on tracking the frequency of minor variant genomes. The ability to predict an emerging variant of SARS-CoV-2 in the global landscape may aid in the evaluation of medical countermeasures and non-pharmaceutical interventions.

TI  - ELUCIDATION OF MOLECULAR PHYLOGENY OF <i>RIGIDOPORUS MICROPORUS</i>: A WHITE ROOT ROT DISEASE FUNGUS OF RUBBER (<i>HEVEA BRASILIENSIS</i>) IN MALAYSIA
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL FOREST SCIENCE
AB  - White root rot (WRR) disease which is caused by Rigidoporus microporus is a major agricultural disease. The disease affects tropical fruits, forest trees, ornamental trees as well as rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) trees. Although WRR causes significant economic losses to planters, there is no effective method to control this disease. The understanding on the population genetics of R. microporus isolates could mitigate WRR disease in plant management. Therefore, the objective of this work was to elucidate molecular phylogeny of R. microporus isolated from rubber trees. Twenty seven R. microporus isolates were characterised using internal transcribed spacer (ITS), Beta-tubulin (beta-tubulin) and translation elongation factor-alpha (tef1-alpha) sequences data. Phylogenetic tree analyses of R. microporus isolates were divided into two major groups; the Asian and African groups. However, there was no distinct geographical structuring in the Asian group, suggesting gene flow happened among the populations. Somatic Incompatibility (SI) test and Inter Simple Sequence Repeat (ISSR) marker revealed that the R. microporus in the rubber plantations partially clustered based on geographical regions. The genetic diversity of R. microporus by ISSR revealed four major groups. The findings of the present study provide a baseline data for breeders and plant pathologists to enable them strategise effective and sustainable WRR disease management.

TI  - Vaccination coverage in the context of the emerging Yellow Fever threat in French Guiana
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   French Guiana, a French overseas department located in South America between Brazil and Surinam, is the only European territory geographically located in the Amazonian forest complex and is considered endemic for yellow fever (YF).
   In the context of the emergent threat of YF in Latin America, we conducted a large household cross-sectional survey from June to October 2017 to estimate vaccination coverage in the population and to determine associations with sociodemographic and geographical characteristics.
   Methodology/Principal findings
   In total, 1,415 households and 2,697 individuals were included from the 22 municipalities of French Guiana. YF vaccination coverage was estimated at 95.0% (95% CI: 93.4-96.2) in the entire territory but was spatially heterogeneous, with the lowest levels estimated in the western part of the territory along the Surinamese cross-border region, particularly in children under 16 years who were not enrolled in school, immigrant adults and disadvantaged populations with low socioeconomic indexes.
   Conclusions/Significance
   Despite the good vaccination coverage against YF in the general population of French Guiana resulting from the compulsory nature of YF vaccination for residents and travelers, there is an urgent need to improve vaccination coverage in vulnerable populations living in the northwestern part of the territory to limit the risk of transmission in the context of the emerging YF threat in South America.
   Despite the relative rarity of YF and the significant number of infectious and tropical diseases in French Guiana, clinicians should adopt a high index of suspicion for YF, particularly in vulnerable and at-risk populations.

TI  - Analysis of support vector machine and maximum likelihood classifiers in land cover classification using Sentinel-2 images
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE INDIAN NATIONAL SCIENCE ACADEMY
AB  - Remote sensing data has been widely applied to classify the land cover more frequently and on a near real-time basis for updating as it is more economic, less time consuming compared to ground based survey. Accurate classification of the land use/cover classes such as water body, cropland, built-up area, scrub land, fallow land, forest etc., is one of the biggest challenges in natural resource inventory, management and monitoring. As accuracy of remote sensing data classification is affected by many parameters which include type of data, presence of heterogeneous landscapes in study area, classification approaches etc., as satellite imagery is complex in nature. Many classifiers have been developed and tested on remotely sensed data for better classification. Classification of remote sensing data is mainly divided into two categories such as supervised and unsupervised. In supervised classification, the decision boundaries in feature space are determined by training the samples. Two supervised classifiers namely maximum likelihood (ML) classifier, which is a parametric classifier that assumes data to be normally distributed, and support vector machine classifier (SVM) which is a non-parametric classifier are used in classification. In the present study, the accuracy of these two classifiers is studied on five different data sets of Sentinel-2 satellite image of different years and sessions to accommodate intra and inter annual variations of the datasets. Sentinel-2 satellite images covering part of Nagpur, located in Maharashtra, India were used for the classification. Classifier accuracy has been calculated using overall accuracy and kappa statistics based on ground truth information. The result obtained were carefully examined by comparing classification accuracies and then by visual analysis. The result shows that SVM classifiers gives better overall accuracy and kappa coefficients and its average value for intra and inter annual classification outputs were 91.78% and 0.89 in that order which is far better than ML classifier which gave 87.07% and 0.83 respectively. The experimental results obtained from the present study, it is clear that SVM classifier produced better accuracy than ML classifier in classifying Sentinel-2 optical image and have significant potential in classifying various land cover classes in the heterogeneous land use/land cover conditions of the tropical regime.

TI  - Abundance of hantavirus hosts in a landscape with black-tailed prairie dog colonies in northwestern Mexico
T2  - MAMMALIAN BIOLOGY
AB  - In order to assess the influence of habitat type on the abundance and distribution of hantavirus reservoir hosts and on the prevalence of hantavirus antibodies, we compared communities of small mammals among three dominant habitats in northwestern Mexico (grassland with prairie dogs colonies, grassland without prairie dogs colonies and mesquite shrubland). Grassland habitats had a very low abundance of hantavirus reservoir hosts (Peromyscus leucopus and P. maniculatus), whereas mesquite shrubland harbored a significantly higher abundance of reservoir hosts. Seropositive hosts were found in mesquite and grassland without prairie dogs (32% overall seroprevalence), but due to the small sample size of hantavirus hosts in grasslands, we could not compare seroprevalence among habitats. Areas with higher abundance of hantavirus hosts can increase the risk of human infections in other systems; therefore, mesquite shrubland may be the habitat that represents the highest risks for human exposure to hantavirus in this area. Given that the black-tailed prairie dog prevents the expansion of mesquite shrubland into grassland habitats, their colonies may indirectly prevent hantavirus host dispersion and expansion throughout this landscape. Future investigations are needed to further understand potential effects of prairie dog colonies on hantavirus epidemiology. (C) 2015 Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Saugetierkunde.

TI  - Altitudinal migration and the future of an iconic Hawaiian honeycreeper in response to climate change and management
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS
AB  - Altitudinal movement by tropical birds to track seasonally variable resources can move them from protected areas to areas of increased vulnerability. In Hawai?i, historical reports suggest that many Hawaiian honeycreepers such as the Iiwi (Drepanis coccinea) once undertook seasonal migrations, but the existence of such movements today is unclear. Because Hawaiian honeycreepers are highly susceptible to avian malaria, currently minimal in high-elevation forests, understanding the degree to which honeycreepers visit lower elevation forests may be critical to predict the current impact of malaria on population dynamics and how susceptible bird populations may respond to climate change and mitigation scenarios. Using radio telemetry data, we demonstrate for the first time that a large fraction of breeding adult and juvenile Iiwi originating from an upper-elevation (1,920m) population at Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge exhibit post-breeding movements well below the upper elevational limit for mosquitoes. Bloom data suggest seasonal variation in floral resources is the primary driver of seasonal movement for Iiwi. To understand the demographic implications of such movement, we developed a spatial individual-based model calibrated using previously published and original data. ?Iiwi dynamics were simulated backward in time, to estimate population levels in the absence of avian malaria, and forward in time, to assess the impact of climate warming as well as two potential mitigation actions. Even in disease-free refuge' populations, we found that breeding densities failed to reach the estimated carrying capacity, suggesting the existence of a seasonal migration load as a result of travel to disease-prevalent areas. We predict that Iiwi may be on the verge of extinction in 2100, with the total number of pairs reaching only +/- 0.2-12.3% of the estimated pre-malaria density, based on an optimistic climate change scenario. The probability of extinction of Iiwi populations, as measured by population estimates for 2100, is strongly related to their estimated migration propensity. Long-term conservation strategies likely will require a multi-pronged response including a reduction of malaria threats, habitat restoration and continued landscape-level access to seasonally variable nectar resources.

TI  - Exploring the Capability of ALOS PALSAR L-Band Fully Polarimetric Data for Land Cover Classification in Tropical Environments
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Among different applications using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, land cover classification of rain forest areas has been investigated. Previous results showed that L-band is more appropriate for such applications. However, SAR images have limited discriminability for mapping large sets of classes compared with optical imagery. The objective of this study was to carry out an analysis about the discriminative capability of an L-band fully polarimetric SAR complex image, compared to the possible subsets of polarizations in amplitude/intensity, for mapping land cover classes in Amazon regions. Two case studies using ALOS PALSAR L-band fully polarimetric images over Brazilian Amazon regions were considered. Several thematic classes, organized into scenarios, were considered for each case study. These scenarios represent distinct classification tasks with variated complexities. Performing a simultaneous analysis of different scenarios is a distinct way to assess the discriminative capability offered by a particular image. A methodology to organize thematic classes into scenarios is proposed in this study. The maximum likelihood classifier (MLC), with specific distributions for SAR data, and support vector machine were considered in this study. The iterated conditional modes algorithm was adopted to incorporate the contextual information in both methods. Considering a kappa coefficient equal to 0.8 as an acceptable minimum, the experiments show that none subset of polarization or fully polarimetric image allows performing discrimination between forest and regeneration types; single-polarized HV data provide acceptable results when the classification problem deals with the discrimination of a few classes; depending on the classification scenario, the dual-polarized HH+HV image produces similar results when compared to multipolarized (i.e., HH+HV+VV) data; in turn, if the MLC method is adopted, multipolarized data may produce close or statistically indifferent classification results compared to those produced with the use of fully polarimetric data.

TI  - When and what time? On the seasonal and daily patterns of mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) in an Atlantic Forest remnant from Southern Brazil
T2  - AUSTRAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - Surveys to discover the habitats of mosquito species (Diptera: Culicidae) are useful for understanding their distribution, seasonality activity patterns, ecological interactions and the risk they pose for disease transmission. Therefore, in this study, we conducted a 1 year survey of mosquito species and analysed the seasonality and daily rhythms of four species found in a forest fragment from Southern Brazil. Collections were performed during the morning, afternoon, and evening, from October 2012 to September 2013. The most abundant species were Psorophora ferox, Aedes crinifer and Coquillettidia venezuelensis. Ae. crinifer was collected during all seasons, exhibiting diurnal and nocturnal activity in all seasons, except summer. Cq. venezuelensis was collected only in spring and summer and was primarily nocturnal. Haemagogus leucocelaenus, which transmits the Yellow Fever virus, was collected in spring, summer, and autumn; this species was primarily diurnal and was more active in the afternoon. Ps. ferox was collected in spring, summer and autumn and was primarily diurnal. Despite the low abundance of mosquito species at our study site, we consider that the knowledge about Culicidae fauna was improved, mainly regarding their biology. We provide new data about mosquito species in a specific area in Southern Brazil, which was once known to record deaths of non-human primates, a phenomenon that may be directly related to the presence of wild yellow fever vector mosquitoes.

TI  - American trypanosomiasis, or Chagas disease, in Panama: a chronological synopsis of ecological and epidemiological research
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
AB  - American trypanosomiasis, or Chagas disease, is a growing public health problem in Panama, and further forest degradation due to human population growth is expected to worsen the situation. Most people infected with the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi are silently ill, and their life expectancy is severely compromised, which contributes to further deterioration of living conditions in endemic regions. Here, we review the outcomes of nearly 100 years of ecological and epidemiological investigation about Chagas disease in Panama, in an attempt to highlight progress, identify needs, and re-orient future efforts. Rhodnius pallescens and Triatoma dimidiata are both primary vectors of T. cruzi in Panama, but R. pallescens seems more efficient in human-altered forest ecosystems due to a greater degree of association with Attalea butyracea. In contrast, T. dimidiata transmits T. cruzi efficiently under more sylvatic conditions (e.g. settlements inside old-growth or secondary forest patches), where its populations reach considerable numbers irrespective of the absence of A. butyracea. A trend of increasing forest degradation, suburbanization, and development of tourism in Panama favoring the establishment of A. butyracea and other palm tree species (Acrocomia sp.) suggests that a colonist species like R. pallescens will continue to play a more prominent role in the transmission of T. cruzi than a forest specialist like T. dimidiata. However, studies about the taxonomic status and ecology of these vectors are still needed in Panama to address their transmission potential fully. The implementation of an active surveillance system and education programs could greatly minimize the risk of Chagas disease transmission in Panama, preventing fatal infections in children from endemic areas.

TI  - The influence of sugarcane pre-harvest fire on hantavirus prevalence in Neotropical small mammals
T2  - ECOSPHERE
AB  - The use of pre-harvest fire in sugarcane fields surprisingly results in an increase in the abundance of Neotropical Sigmodontinae rodents, which might carry hantavirus. By contrast, fire suspension induces a decline in rodents in the first 5 years. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of sugarcane harvest regimes on hantavirus prevalence in wild rodents. Field collections were carried out on a sugarcane production area in Northeast Sao Paulo, which is responsible for 30% of the ethanol production in Brazil. A few years after pre-harvest fire suspension, a high prevalence of hantavirus was found in small rodents at lower population density, but apparently higher population growth rate. Differences in life cycle between the rodents and their predators may explain such density patterns, as small rodents can breed twice or even three times each year, whereas their predators usually breed only once a year. Similarly, the temporal dynamics of the predator-prey relationship suggests that hantavirus prevalence is related to small rodent's population growth and not density. Only Akodon montensis, Calomys tener, and Necromys lasiurus contained immunoglobulin G antibodies against the recombinant nucleoprotein of Araraquara orthohantavirus, a genotype of Andes orthohantavirus, with no interspecific variation in seroprevalence among these species. However, males presented higher prevalence rate than females, possibly due to a male-biased dispersal pattern and a higher frequency of antagonistic interactions. Governance measures to mitigate the role of small wild rodents on the emergence of hantavirus in agricultural landscapes dominated by sugarcane plantations should include the use of wildlife-friendly management techniques (e.g., to mitigate the mortality of the predators of small rodents), human capacity building concerning wildlife-related conflicts, and multifunctionality of agricultural landscapes. Future studies should prioritize the possible relationship between microhabitat structure and hantavirus prevalence in small rodents in agricultural landscapes dominated by sugarcane fields.

TI  - Natural Populations from the <i>Phytophthora palustris</i> Complex Show a High Diversity and Abundance of ssRNA and dsRNA Viruses
T2  - JOURNAL OF FUNGI
AB  - We explored the virome of the "Phytophthora palustris complex", a group of aquatic specialists geographically limited to Southeast and East Asia, the native origin of many destructive invasive forest Phytophthora spp. Based on high-throughput sequencing (RNAseq) of 112 isolates of "P. palustris" collected from rivers, mangroves, and ponds, and natural forests in subtropical and tropical areas in Indonesia, Taiwan, and Japan, 52 putative viruses were identified, which, to varying degrees, were phylogenetically related to the families Botybirnaviridae, Narnaviridae, Tombusviridae, and Totiviridae, and the order Bunyavirales. The prevalence of all viruses in their hosts was investigated and confirmed by RT-PCR. The rich virus composition, high abundance, and distribution discovered in our study indicate that viruses are naturally infecting taxa from the "P. palustris complex" in their natural niche, and that they are predominant members of the host cellular environment. Certain Indonesian localities are the viruses' hotspots and particular "P. palustris" isolates show complex multiviral infections. This study defines the first bi-segmented bunya-like virus together with the first tombus-like and botybirna-like viruses in the genus Phytophthora and provides insights into the spread and evolution of RNA viruses in the natural populations of an oomycete species.

TI  - Decadal Change in the Population of <i>Dendrogyra cylindrus</i> (Scleractinia: Meandrinidae) in Old Providence and St. Catalina Islands, Colombian Caribbean
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
AB  - The IUCN considers the stony coral Dendrogyra cylindrus as vulnerable. However, there is insufficient information on its population structure and dynamics, conservation status, or extinction risk and population decreases have been inferred from observations of habitat degradation. In 2002 and 2012, surveys using manta tows, circular plots and satellite images were performed in Old Providence and Santa Catalina Islands (Seaflower Biosphere Reserve) to determine changes in the condition and structure of a local population of D. cylindrus and its habitat. Size-frequency histograms were asymmetric and leptokurtic, showing positive distribution induced by colony fragmentation, which is indicative of reef degradation. Signs of degradation were more evident in 2012, when partial mortality of living tissue in the parent colony yielded 96.6% of the asexually produced fragments. Most of the fragments were from larger colonies (>= 115 cm), which exhibited the highest partial and total mortality (>50%). Three of the four benthic habitats used by the species in 2002 were seen in 2012, but with reduced areas. The results suggest that the reduction of living tissue, the dominance of colonies produced asexually, and reduced size of fragments limit population growth and species viability in an unfavorable and changing habitat within this marine protected area (MPA) of the southwestern Caribbean. In the west of the reef complex of Old Providence, a synergy of multiple stressors could cause the habitat degradation and the fragmentation of colonies, limiting the potential recovery of the species and therefore the ability to create a healthy, genetically diverse and resilient population. Thus, these stressors must be minimized to prevent local extinction. Monitoring the population trends and recording sexual recruitment continues to be vital to understand the larvae's habitat selection and determine whether these habitats are suitable for the survival of coral recruits. Other stressors to be monitored include anchor damage, diseases and bleaching. We recommend the MPA management program to include specific plans of conservation, recovery and restoration for coral reef builders species like D. cylindrus.

TI  - Synanthropy of Sarcophagidae (Diptera) in La Pintada, Antioquia-Colombia
T2  - REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL
AB  - Recently, populations of flies have increased in numbers given the elevated levels of organic matter waste produced by anthropic activities and domestication of animals. Such increase represents a worldwide health concern, since flies can be vectors of human diseases. The great variety of feeding and developmental habits of flies of the family Sarcophagidae taking place on animal corpses, feces and decomposed organic matter make them potential vectors of pathogens. Herein, we evaluated the synanthropic index (SI), as well as other ecological aspects of this family, through simultaneous monthly samplings in three areas with different degrees of human disturbance (urban, rural and forest). Each area had four van Someren Rydon traps, each one with a different bait (i.e., human feces, chicken viscera, fish and decomposing onion). Traps were active during 48 hours each month, and specimen collection was made every 12 hours. A total of 7 446 Sarcophagidae individuals were collected (1 275 males and 6 171 females), belonging to 27 species and nine genera. Tricharaea (Sarcophagula) canuta (SI=+96.67), Oxysarcodexia taitensis (SI=+93.85), Peckia (Peckia) chrysostoma (SI=+90.00) and Tricharaea (Sarcophagula) occidua (SI=+88.76) exhibited the highest values of synanthropy index, revealing a strong preference for human settlements. The most abundant species were Oxysarcodexia conclausa (21.80%), Ravinia effrenata (18.67%), Oxysarcodexia bakeri (11.45%) and Oxysarcodexia taitensis (10.20%), all of which exhibited preference for urban environments. Additionally, we are reporting seven new records of Sarcophagid flies for Colombia: Oxysarcodexia angrensis, Oxysarcodexia bakeri, Oxysarcodexia diana, Oxysarcodexia similata, Oxysarcodexia timida, Peckia (Peckia) pexata and Titanogrypa (Cucullomyia) placida.

TI  - HURRICANE FREQUENCY AND LANDFALL DISTRIBUTION FOR COASTAL WETLANDS OF THE GULF COAST, USA
T2  - WETLANDS
AB  - The regularity and severity of tropical storms are major determinants controlling ecosystem structure And Succession for coastal ecosystems. Hurricane landfall rates vary greatly with high and low frequency for given coastal stretches of the southeastern United States. Site-specific meteorological data of hurricane wind speeds and direction. however, are only available for select Populated cities of relatively sparse distribution and inland from the coast. A spatial simulation model of hurricane circulation, HURASIM. was applied to reconstruct chronologies of hurricane wind speeds and vectors for northern Gulf coast locations derived from historical tracking data of North Atlantic tropical storms dating back to 1851. Contrasts of storm frequencies showed that tropical storm incidence is nearly double for Florida coastal ecosystems than the westernmost stretches of Texas coastline. Finer-scale spatial simulations for the north-central Gulf coast exhibited sub-regional differences in storm strength and frequency with coastal position and latitude. The overall pattern of storm incidence in the Gulf basin indicates that the disturbance regime of coastal areas varies greatly along the coast, inland from the coast, and temporally over the period of record. Field and modeling Studies of coastal ecosystems will benefit from this retrospective analysis of hurricane incidence and intensity both on a local or regional basis.

TI  - Habitat-based larval interventions: A new perspective for malaria control
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Interest in environmental management of mosquito larval habitats has been rekindled due to deterioration of malaria in tropical Africa. Environmental management programs were typically implemented as "all-out" campaigns by treating all potential breeding habitats. In contrast, targeted environmental management is based on a sound understanding of the heterogeneity in mosquito productivity. However, deficiencies in field methodology for measuring productivity hamper our progress in understanding of mosquito productivity. To address these issues, we develop a framework of habitat-based interventions by adoption of a landscape approach to elucidate mechanisms underlying mosquito productivity. The importance of vigorously quantitative estimation of the productivity is highlighted. Spatial models are proposed to examine the interrelationship between mosquito productivity and oviposition of gravid mosquitoes. In our view. environmental management approaches must take into account variability in productivity, in efforts to improve feasibility, cost-effectiveness, and sustainability of such approaches, particularly when implemented along with other malaria control measures.

TI  - Environmental and socioeconomic risk factors associated with visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis: a systematic review
T2  - PARASITOLOGY RESEARCH
AB  - We performed a systematic review of the literature published since 1900 about leishmaniasis a neglected vector-borne disease, focused on environmental and social risk factors for visceral (VL) and cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) to better understand their impact on the incidence of disease. The search terms were "leishmaniasis" AND "risk factors" using Google Scholar, PudMed, and Scielo. We reviewed 177 articles, 95 studies for VL, 75 for CL, and 7 on both forms. We identified 14 categories of risk factors which were divided into three groups: socioeconomic (7), environmental (5), and climate (2) variables. Socioeconomic factors were also associated with disease incidence in vulnerable human populations of arid and tropical developing regions. Environmental and climate factors showed significant associations with the incidence of VL and CL in all the studies that considered them. Proximity to natural vegetation remnants increased disease risk in both the New and Old World while the climate conditions favorable for disease transmission differed among regions. We propose a common conceptual framework for both clinical forms that highlights networks of interaction among risk factors. In both clinical forms, the interplay of these factors played a major role in disease incidence. Although there are similarities in environmental and socioeconomic conditions that mediate the transmission cycle of tropical, arid, and Mediterranean regions, the behavior of vector and reservoirs in each region is different. Special attention should be given to the possibility of vector adaptation to urban environments in developing countries where populations with low socioeconomic status are particularly vulnerable to the disease.

TI  - Cross-sectional Study of the Burden of Vector-Borne and Soil-Transmitted Polyparasitism in Rural Communities of Coast Province, Kenya
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background: In coastal Kenya, infection of human populations by a variety of parasites often results in co-infection or polyparasitism. These parasitic infections, separately and in conjunction, are a major cause of chronic clinical and sub-clinical human disease and exert a long-term toll on economic welfare of affected populations. Risk factors for these infections are often shared and overlap in space, resulting in interrelated patterns of transmission that need to be considered at different spatial scales. Integration of novel quantitative tools and qualitative approaches is needed to analyze transmission dynamics and design effective interventions.
   Methodology: Our study was focused on detecting spatial and demographic patterns of single-and co-infection in six villages in coastal Kenya. Individual and household level data were acquired using cross-sectional, socio-economic, and entomological surveys. Generalized additive models (GAMs and GAMMs) were applied to determine risk factors for infection and co-infections. Spatial analysis techniques were used to detect local clusters of single and multiple infections.
   Principal findings: Of the 5,713 tested individuals, more than 50% were infected with at least one parasite and nearly 20% showed co-infections. Infections with Schistosoma haematobium (26.0%) and hookworm (21.4%) were most common, as was co-infection by both (6.3%). Single and co-infections shared similar environmental and socio-demographic risk factors. The prevalence of single and multiple infections was heterogeneous among and within communities. Clusters of single and co-infections were detected in each village, often spatially overlapped, and were associated with lower SES and household crowding.
   Conclusion: Parasitic infections and co-infections are widespread in coastal Kenya, and their distributions are heterogeneous across landscapes, but inter-related. We highlighted how shared risk factors are associated with high prevalence of single infections and can result in spatial clustering of co-infections. Spatial heterogeneity and synergistic risk factors for polyparasitism need to be considered when designing surveillance and intervention strategies.

TI  - An unsettling explanation for the failure of skatole-baited ovitraps to capture <i>Culex</i> mosquitoes
T2  - INSECT SCIENCE
AB  - Culex mosquitoes are primarily found in temperate and tropical regions worldwide where they play a crucial role as main vectors of filarial worms and arboviruses. In Recife, a northeast city in Brazil, high densities of Culex quinquefasciatus are often found in association with human populated areas. In marked contrast to another part of the city, field tests conducted in the neighborhood of Sitio dos Pintos showed that trapping of mosquitoes in skatole-baited ovitraps did not differ significantly from captures in control (water) traps. Thus, classical and molecular taxonomic approaches were used to analyze the Culex species circulating in Sitio dos Pintos. Results obtained from both approaches agreed on the cocirculation of Culex quinquefasciatus and Culex nigripalpus in three different areas of this neighborhood. What was initially considered as an unexpected failure of this lure turned out to be a more unsettling problem, that is, the first report in Recife of Culex nigripalpus, a vector of Venezuelan equine encephalitisvirus and West Nile virus. Unplanned urbanization processes close to remnants of the Atlantic forest, such as observed in Sitio dos Pintos, may have contributed to the introduction of Cx. nigripalpus in urban areas.

TI  - Discrimination of <i>Uranotaenia</i> species (Diptera: Culicidae) from Madagascar based on morphology and wing morphometric traits
T2  - ZOOTAXA
AB  - The genus Uranotaenia (Diptera: Culicidae) has been well documented in Madagascar where it includes 73 species, 89.4% being endemic. However, one problem is that most species are morphologically similar in the adult stage. Here, 713 Uranotaenia specimens collected in the tropical forests of Anorana and Maromizaha between 2008 and 2014 were examined. Using the dichotomous keys for the Uranotaenia fauna of Madagascar published in 2004, three species were identified: Uranotaenia neireti (220), Ur alboabdominalis (110) and Ur. mayottensis (28). The other specimens (355) were not identifiable and were classified as Uranotaenia sp1. Using wing morphometry, the four taxa were classified into four morphogroups. Within the Uranotaenia sp1 group, specimens from the Anorana forest and those from the Maromizaha forest overlapped. This result suggests that wing morphometric traits could be a good marker to distinguish Uranotaenia species in Madagascar.

TI  - Contributions of the combination of optical and RADAR satellite images in the study of vector-borne diseases: the case of malaria at the border between French Guiana and Brazil
T2  - CONFINS-REVUE FRANCO-BRESILIENNE DE GEOGRAPHIE-REVISTA FRANCO-BRASILEIRA DE GEOGRAFIA
AB  - The distribution of mosquito vectors of malaria is controlled by various factors such as climate, land cover and land use, or human activities. In the Amazon region, endemic foci of malaria persist, particularly on the border between French Guiana and Amapa State in Brazil. This area, long by 300 km, presents many difficulties in collecting informations necessary for the health management of the local populations. In this type of geographical context, with few, isolated and cross-border data, a methodology based on the exploitation of remote sensing images is particularly appropriate. Remote sensing data have wide spatial coverage, and a large range of spatial resolutions. Here we present an approach combining high resolution and very high spatial resolution optical and SAR satellite data. Our method makes it possible to map the different types of land cover in the tropical border context French Guiana - Brazil, characterized by a persistent cloud cover. The results show that the complementarity of optical and RADAR sensors allows the production of multi-scale mapping of land use/land cover (LULC) independently from cloud cover. In particular, we produced LULC classifications to generate spatialized indicators and characterize the relationship between suitable habitats for malaria vectors and environmental factors. Through a discussion on the application of composite LULC classifications for the assessment of malaria exposure risk at various scales, this case study illustrates the interest of satellite remote sensing approaches to characterize landscape elements and land cover, which can account for the distribution of vector populations in connection with arboviruses transmission.

TI  - Parasitic exploitation as an engine of diversity
T2  - BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS
AB  - Parasitic exploitation occurs within and between a wide variety of taxa in a plethora of diverse contexts. Theoretical and empirical analyses indicate that parasitic exploitation can generate substantial genetic and phenotypic polymorphism within species. Under some circumstances, parasitic exploitation may also be an important factor causing reproductive isolation and promoting speciation. Here we review research relevant to the relationship between parasitic exploitation, within species-polymorphism, and speciation in some of the major arenas in which such exploitation has been studied. This includes research on the vertebrate major histocompatibility loci, plant pathogen interactions, the evolution of sexual reproduction, intragenomic conflict, sexual conflict, kin mimicry and social parasitism, tropical forest diversity and the evolution of language. We conclude by discussing some of the issues raised by comparing the effect of parasitic exploitation on polymorphism and speciation in different contexts.

TI  - Knowledge Production on Congenital Chagas Disease across Time, Borders and Disciplines: A Comprehensive Scoping Review
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE
AB  - Congenital transmission is a key route of Trypanosoma cruzi infection in Latin America and globally, contributing significantly to the burden of Chagas disease. The interruption of transmission from mother to child has recently become a focus issue. However, the research landscape on congenital Chagas disease remains largely unexplored. The purpose of this scoping review is to assess the production of knowledge on congenital Chagas disease (CCD), aiming to identify research trends and potential gaps. Our initial hypothesis was that the CCD literature overly represents the medical sciences and that there is a need for socio-cultural research on the subject. We conducted a systematic search of publications focusing on congenital Chagas disease in six languages (English, Spanish, Portuguese, French, German and Italian). This comprehensive literature search identified 876 studies that met the inclusion criteria, out of a total of 8893 sources. The relevant literature was analyzed by language, year of publication, discipline, source type and research location. The main outcome of this study has been to prove our hypothesis that there is a scarcity of knowledge produced within the non-biomedical sciences on CCD. This underscores the need for further exploration into the social and structural issues surrounding this disease. Visually clear data concerning congenital Chagas disease produced by this study can contribute to hone in future research efforts and support funding applications. Additionally, this article provides a reference list that other researchers can consult for their own studies.

TI  - Support vector machine based modeling of evapotranspiration using hydro-climatic variables in a sub-tropical environment
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
AB  - Existing models and methods report crop coefficient (K-c) as a function of time but do not consider the variations due to surface conditions, wetting methods, meteorological conditions, and other biophysical factors. These limitations result in erroneous crop evapotranspiration (ETc) estimates, especially for nonstandard conditions (e.g. plastic mulch). We present Support Vector Machine (SVM), a data-driven model based on statistical learning theory, for predicting generic K-c and ETc using a uniquely large dataset (10 seasons) from lysimeters for multiple crop-seasons combination under the plastic mulch conditions. The data used in this study were obtained from six years of lysimeter-based measurements (Shukla et al., 2006, 2012, 2014a, 2014b; Shukla and Knowles, 2011) for two distinctly different crop types (vine and erect) under two contrasting irrigation methods, drip and sub-irrigation. The SVM-based models predicted bell pepper (erect crop; r(2) =0.71) and watermelon (vine crop; r(2) =0.82) K-c as a function of time, water table depth, and number of rainfall events. The time since transplant represents the plant growth and, therefore, transpiration. The water table depth and rainfall events capture the effect of surface soil moisture on evaporation. The crop type-specific model is robust since it works for two different irrigation methods and growing seasons (spring and fall). The SVM model was superior to the Artificial Neural Network and Relevance Vector Machine models, two data-driven models used in hydrology. The errors in predicting ETc from the SVM model were only 2.6% and 11.2% for watermelon and bell pepper, respectively, highlighting the model accuracy. For both crops, the SVM predicted K-c values were not statistically different from the actual K-c values. In contrast, the FAO-56 values were significantly lower than the actual K-c values for both bell pepper (p = 0.016) and watermelon (p = 0.025). When evaluated in the context of watershed-scale budgets, the SVM model improved the accuracy in ETc estimates by 49.3 mm over the FAO-56 method, and this improvement represents 70% (70.7 mm) of the observed surface flow. Improved accuracy of the SVM model makes it useful in deriving local K-c using readily available hydro-climatic data for applications ranging from field-scale water management to watershed-scale modeling. The proposed model can be used to develop region-specific K-c to improve ETc estimates. Future efforts should be made to explore the development of similar models for open-field crops.

TI  - Effects of Scale on Modeling West Nile Virus Disease Risk
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Modeling vector-borne diseases is best conducted when heterogeneity among interacting biotic and abiotic processes is captured. However, the successful integration of these complex processes is difficult, hindered by a lack of understanding of how these relationships influence disease transmission across varying scales. West Nile virus (WNV) is the most important mosquito-borne disease in the United States. Vectored by Culex mosquitoes and maintained in the environment by avian hosts, the virus can spill over into humans and horses, sometimes causing severe neuroinvasive illness. Several modeling studies have evaluated drivers of WNV disease risk, but nearly all have done so at broad scales and have reported mixed results of the effects of common explanatory variables. As a result, fine-scale relationships with common explanatory variables, particularly climatic, socioeconomic, and human demographic, remain uncertain across varying spatial extents. Using an interdisciplinary approach and an ongoing 12-year study of the Chicago region, this study evaluated the factors explaining WNV disease risk at high spatiotemporal resolution, comparing the human WNV model and covariate performance across three increasing spatial extents: ultrafine, local, and county scales. Our results demonstrate that as spatial extent increased, model performance increased. In addition, only six of the 23 assessed covariates were included in best-fit models of at least two scales. These results suggest that the mechanisms driving WNV ecology are scale-dependent and covariate importance increases as extent decreases. These tools may be particularly helpful for public health, mosquito, and disease control personnel in predicting and preventing disease within local and fine-scale jurisdictions, before spillover occurs.

TI  - Modeling intra-mosquito dynamics of Zika virus and its dose-dependence confirms the low epidemic potential of <i>Aedes albopictus</i>
T2  - PLOS PATHOGENS
AB  - Author summary
   Zika virus (ZIKV) has emerged worldwide and triggered large outbreaks in human populations. While the yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti is considered the primary vector of ZIKV, the Asian tiger mosquito Aedes albopictus has been shown experimentally to transmit the virus and has been involved in a few autochthonous transmission in France in 2019. Here, we provide a comprehensive study on the ability of Ae. albopictus mosquitoes to transmit ZIKV by considering the within-host dynamics of ZIKV infection in humans and its impact on both mosquito infection probability and time to mosquito infectiousness. These empirical data were then leveraged by in silico simulations to embed them into their epidemiological context. Our study reveals a low but existing epidemic potential of Ae. albopictus for ZIKV, whatever their tropical or temperate origins. We identified mosquito density as a predictor for ZIKV outbreak occurrence when vectored by Ae. albopictus. Our findings help to explain the absence of large scale ZIKV epidemics in territories occupied by Ae. albopictus but call for active surveillance and eradication programs to maintain the risk of emergence to a low level.
   Originating from African forests, Zika virus (ZIKV) has now emerged worldwide in urbanized areas, mainly transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. Although Aedes albopictus can transmit ZIKV experimentally and was suspected to be a ZIKV vector in Central Africa, the potential of this species to sustain virus transmission was yet to be uncovered until the end of 2019, when several autochthonous transmissions of the virus vectored by Ae. albopictus occurred in France. Aside from these few locally acquired ZIKV infections, most territories colonized by Ae. albopictus have been spared so far. The risk level of ZIKV emergence in these areas remains however an open question. To assess Ae. albopictus' vector potential for ZIKV and identify key virus outbreak predictors, we built a complete framework using the complementary combination of (i) dose-dependent experimental Ae. albopictus exposure to ZIKV followed by time-dependent assessment of infection and systemic infection rates, (ii) modeling of intra-human ZIKV viremia dynamics, and (iii) in silico epidemiological simulations using an Agent-Based Model. The highest risk of transmission occurred during the pre-symptomatic stage of the disease, at the peak of viremia. At this dose, mosquito infection probability was estimated to be 20%, and 21 days were required to reach the median systemic infection rates. Mosquito population origin, either temperate or tropical, had no impact on infection rates or intra-host virus dynamic. Despite these unfavorable characteristics for transmission, Ae. albopictus was still able to trigger and yield large outbreaks in a simulated environment in the presence of sufficiently high mosquito biting rates. Our results reveal a low but existing epidemic potential of Ae. albopictus for ZIKV, that might explain the absence of large scale ZIKV epidemics so far in territories occupied only by Ae. albopictus. They nevertheless support active surveillance and eradication programs in these territories to maintain the risk of emergence to a low level.

TI  - Geographic population structure of the African malaria vector <i>Anopheles gambiae</i> suggests a role for the forest-savannah biome transition as a barrier to gene flow
T2  - EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS
AB  - The primary Afrotropical malaria mosquito vector Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto has a complex population structure. In west Africa, this species is split into two molecular forms and displays local and regional variation in chromosomal arrangements and behaviors. To investigate patterns of macrogeographic population substructure, 25 An. gambiae samples from 12 African countries were genotyped at 13 microsatellite loci. This analysis detected the presence of additional population structuring, with the M-form being subdivided into distinct west, central, and southern African genetic clusters. These clusters are coincident with the central African rainforest belt and northern and southern savannah biomes, which suggests restrictions to gene flow associated with the transition between these biomes. By contrast, geographically patterned population substructure appears much weaker within the S-form.

TI  - Anthrax in western and Central African great apes
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY
AB  - During the period of December 2004 to January 2005, Bacillus anthracis killed three wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) and one gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) in a tropical forest in Cameroon. While this is the second anthrax outbreak in wild chimpanzees, this is the first case of anthrax in gorillas ever reported. The number of great apes in Central Africa is dramatically declining and the populations are seriously threatened by diseases, mainly Ebola. Nevertheless, a considerable number of deaths cannot be attributed to Ebola virus and remained unexplained. Our results show that diseases other than Ebola may also threaten wild great apes, and indicate that the role of anthrax in great ape mortality may have been underestimated. These results suggest that risk identification, assessment, and management for the survival of the last great apes should be performed with an open mind, since various pathogens with distinct characteristics in epidemiology and pathogenicity may impact the populations. An animal mortality monitoring network covering the entire African tropical forest, with the dual aims of preventing both great ape extinction and human disease outbreaks, will create necessary baseline data for such risk assessments and management plans.

TI  - Diversity of the diet of Glossina palpalis palpalis in the forest zone of Cote d'Ivoire:: Relation to the prevalence of African human trypanosomiasis
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE & INTERNATIONAL HEALTH
AB  - The feeding habits of Glossina palpalis palpalis, the main vector of human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) were retrospectively analysed using data collected between 1984 and 1994 in five areas in the forest belt in the mid-west of Cote d'Ivoire. The authors compare the feeding habits of the vector in these different foci. This analysis is aimed at determining if there is any relationship between the feeding pattern of tsetse-flies and the prevalence rates of HAT. The feeding pattern was measured using two indices: the conventional index of Shannon and Weaver (Ish) and a new one, the zoophily/anthropophily index (Za). The latter is an estimate of the ratio of the percentage of animal blood meals divided by the percentage of human blood meals. There was no correlation between apparent density and prevalence rate. A high Ish and a high Za were observed in the foci of Vavoua, Zoukougbeu and Sinfra where prevalence rates of HAT were high. Conversely, a low Ish and a low Za were observed in the hypoendemic areas of Daniafla and Gagnoa. Both indices are highly but not significantly correlated with prevalence rates. The Za index seemed to be more strongly correlated to the disease rate as compared to the Ish index. The epidemiological significance of these observations is discussed.

TI  - The UCD advanced canopy-atmosphere-soil algorithm: Comparisons with observations from different climate and vegetation regimes
T2  - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
AB  - The University of California, Davis (UCD), Advanced Canopy-Atmosphere-Soil Algorithm (ACASA) is presented and its output is compared with a comprehensive set of observations at six diverse sites. ACASA is a multi-layer canopy-surface-layer model that solves the steady-state Reynolds-averaged fluid flow equations to the third-order. These equations include an explicit representation of the steady-state, horizontally homogeneous, diabatic set of vector and scalar fluxes and flux transports. ACASA includes a fourth-order, near-exact technique to calculate leaf, stem, and soil surface temperatures and surface energy fluxes at various levels within the canopy. Plant physiological response to micro-environmental conditions is also included using Ball-Berry/von Caemmerer-Farquhar formulations. Observed energy fluxes and microenvironmental conditions from a grass held in the Netherlands, deciduous and coniferous forests in Canada, tropical pasture and forest in Brazil, and an ancient temperate rainforest in the USA are compared with simulated values.
   Results indicate that simulated and observed estimates of monthly to annual means of all surface fluxes agree within 95% confidence thresholds for all six sites. Observed and simulated hourly estimates of net radiation are also in excellent agreement for all sites considered. Observed and simulated hourly sensible- and latent-heat flux estimates are in very good statistical agreement in most cases. Differences that exist between ACASA and observed sensible-and latent-heat flux estimates are of the same magnitudes as observational uncertainties. Estimates of observed and simulated hourly values of canopy and ground heat storage are within 95% statistical confidence limits of agreement with observations in most cases. Simulated and measured values of daytime intra-canopy mean wind speed, temperature, and specific humidity agree with 95% confidence within both a tropical and temperate rainforest at all levels. Results also indicate that, in general, ACASA produces flux estimates closer to observations with significantly less scatter than does the Biosphere-Atmosphere Transfer Scheme. Sensitivity tests show that reducing the vertical resolution, linearizing surface temperature calculations, and/or simplifying the treatment of surface-layer turbulence each altered mean sensible- and latent-heat flux estimates by amounts that are statistically significant in many cases. Results show that simplifying the model alters flux predictions in manners not simply related to vegetation character, and that using ACASA at its full complexity for all vegetation regimes is warranted. Increasing the vertical resolution beyond 20 layers improved flux predictions at tropical locations but had little impact elsewhere.

TI  - Saving rodents, losing primates-Why we need tailored bushmeat management strategies
T2  - PEOPLE AND NATURE
AB  - 1. Efforts to curb the unsustainable wildlife trade in tropical forests conceptualize bushmeat as a generic resource, exploited by a homogeneous group. However, bushmeat is composed of miscellaneous species differing in risks of zoonotic disease transmissions, sensitivity to hunting and abundance. If people choose these species for varying reasons, mitigation approaches that neglect specific drivers would likely target abundant species, e.g. rodents. Meanwhile, rare species of greater conservation relevance, like many primates, would be overlooked. Additionally, if reasons vary between user groups, their responsiveness to interventions may differ too.
   2. We assessed this possibility for three common strategies to mitigate bushmeat use, which are: development-based-reducing reliance on bushmeat; educational-increasing environmental and school education; and cultural-promoting environmentally friendly habits.
   3. We interviewed 348 hunters, 202 traders and 985 consumers of bushmeat around Tai National Park, Cote d'Ivoire, and tested if factors related to the above strategies affected selection for primates, duikers and rodents.
   4. Our analyses revealed that people chose taxa for very different reasons. Users with shared characteristics favoured similar taxa; hunters economically reliant on bushmeat income targeted primates and duikers, while hunters and consumers nutritionally reliant on wildlife protein preferred rodents. Different groups used the same taxa for varying reasons. For example, hunting of primates was associated with economic needs, while their consumption appeared a matter of status. Meanwhile, cultural habits, like religion, specifically affected consumption and taboos inhibited the use of primates; environmental awareness was linked to lower utilization of most taxa within most user groups.
   5. Our results demonstrate that educational-, cultural-, and development-based strategies may address different needs and taxa. Consumers may present a key target group, as they rejected rare species for multiple cultural and educational reasons. Notably, the widespread effect of environmental awareness could facilitate large-scale demand-reduction approaches. Nevertheless, there is no one-size-fits-all solution and campaigns need to be tailored to specific taxa and user groups. Ultimately, clear target definitions, prior in-depth research, community-driven solutions and tools from marketing and psychology may help to design novel strategies that encompass the diversity of bushmeat species and its users.

TI  - Evaluation of sainfoin accessions exposed to powdery mildew disease at four locations in Iran
T2  - TROPICAL GRASSLANDS-FORRAJES TROPICALES
AB  - In order to evaluate resistance of sainfoin (Onobrychis viciifolia) to powdery mildew, seeds of 19 accessions were collected from different parts of Iran and sown at 4 locations, i.e. Kheirabad, Khoramabad, Semirom and Tabriz, in 2014. Accessions were evaluated for powdery mildew severity index (DSI), forage dry matter yield (DM), dry matter digestibility (DMD) and crude protein (CP) and water soluble carbohydrate (WSC) concentrations over 4 years. Based on Duncan's test, accessions 15353 and 3001 showed disease severity index lower than 25% and were nominated as resistant to powdery mildew. Accessions Oshnavieh and Polycross were considered semi-resistant due to their DSI ranging from 25 to 50%. Other accessions were considered susceptible because their DSI was higher than 50%. The resistant accessions (15353 and 3001) with average yields of 3,341 and 3,304 kg DM/ha were ranked as having high DM production, in addition to displaying high DMD plus high CP and WSC concentrations. Severity of powdery mildew infection was linked negatively with all 3 quality traits, i.e. DMD and CP and WSC concentrations. According to Eberhart/Russell regression results, stability of accessions 3001 and 15353 for DSI and DM yield was confirmed across 4 locations. We recommend the use of accessions 3001 and 15353 in future breeding programs to increase resistance to powdery mildew, while at least maintaining yield and quality attributes. Evaluation of other sources of sainfoin germplasm should continue to identify further resistant accessions.

TI  - Management of insecticide resistance in the major Aedes vectors of arboviruses: Advances and challenges
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   The landscape of mosquito-borne disease risk has changed dramatically in recent decades, due to the emergence and reemergence of urban transmission cycles driven by invasive Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus. Insecticide resistance is already widespread in the yellow fever mosquito, Ae. Aegypti; is emerging in the Asian tiger mosquito Ae. Albopictus; and is now threatening the global fight against human arboviral diseases such as dengue, yellow fever, chikungunya, and Zika. Because the panel of insecticides available for public health is limited, it is of primary importance to preserve the efficacy of existing and upcoming active ingredients. Timely implementation of insecticide resistance management (IRM) is crucial to maintain the arsenal of effective public health insecticides and sustain arbovirus vector control.
   Methodology and principal findings
   This Review is one of a series being generated by the Worldwide Insecticide resistance Network (WIN) and aims at defining the principles and concepts underlying IRM, identifying the main factors affecting the evolution of resistance, and evaluating the value of existing tools for resistance monitoring. Based on the lessons taken from resistance strategies used for other vector species and agricultural pests, we propose a framework for the implementation of IRM strategies for Aedes mosquito vectors.
   Conclusions and significance
   Although IRM should be a fixture of all vector control programs, it is currently often absent from the strategic plans to control mosquito-borne diseases, especially arboviruses. Experiences from other public health disease vectors and agricultural pests underscore the need for urgent action in implementing IRM for invasive Aedes mosquitoes. Based on a plan developed for malaria vectors, here we propose some key activities to establish a global plan for IRM in Aedes spp.

TI  - <i>TRYPANOSOMA CRUZI</i> AND <i>LEISHMANIA</i> SP INFECTION IN WILDLIFE FROM URBAN RAINFOREST FRAGMENTS IN NORTHEAST BRAZIL
T2  - JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE DISEASES
AB  - Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania sp. are important protozoan parasites for humans and animals in the Americas, causing Chagas disease and cutaneous or visceral leishmaniasis, respectively. These vector-borne diseases affect permanent and transient populations in developing tropical countries that exhibit favorable conditions for the perpetuation of the parasite cycle. Our objective was to investigate the occurrence of infection with these parasites in wild animals from urban rainforest fragments in the city of Salvador, the largest city in the northeast region of Brazil. Sixty-five wild animals were captured, clinically examined, and sampled for parasite detection by PCR and culture. Ten different mammalian genera were identified, being 58% (38/65) marsupials. The prevalence of T. cruzi and Leishmania sp. infections was 13% and 43%, respectively. Both parasites were detected by PCR in 11% (7/65), three of which were also double infected as determined by culture. Among the 28 animals found infected with at least one parasite (43%, 28/65), 68% (19/28) were marsupials, two specimens were Callithrix sp. (7%), and one was Trinomys sp. (3%). Most infected animals (89%) had no clinical signs of disease. We found that healthy free-living animals from urban rainforest fragments harbored pathogenic trypanosomatids and should be included in epidemiology studies of diseases in big cities in tropical countries, as these cities grow and engulf rainforest remnants.

TI  - A New Approach Based on Balancing Composite Motion Optimization and Deep Neural Networks for Spatial Prediction of Landslides at Tropical Cyclone Areas
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
AB  - Landslides are a significant geological hazard that annually cause extensive damage and loss of life worldwide. Therefore, it is crucial to have reliable prediction models for landslide susceptibility in order to identify high-risk areas and implement proactive measures to prevent or mitigate their impacts. The purpose of this study is to propose and evaluate a novel approach called BCMO-DeepNeuralNets for spatial prediction of the areas most susceptible to landslides. The study focuses on a tropical cyclone area in three districts of central Vietnam, namely Nam Tra My, Bac Tra My, and Phuoc Son. Accordingly, ten input factors were considered: slope, aspect, elevation, relief amplitude, land use, soil type, road distance, geology, fault distance, and rainfall. The proposed BCMO-DeepNeuralNets method leverages the power of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to develop a deep-learning model capable of inferring landslide susceptibility indices. To optimize this model, the study employs the Balancing Composite Motions Optimization (BCMO) technique. Additionally, Logistic Regression (LR) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) are used as benchmark models to confirm the efficacy of the proposed approach. To evaluate the prediction performance of the models, popular metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), accuracy (Acc), and Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) are employed. The results show that the BCMO-DeepNeuralNets model exhibits high prediction performance, with an MSE of 0.038, Acc of 93.4%, and AUC of 0.971. This model outperforms the benchmark models, LR and SVM. Consequently, BCMO-DeepNeuralNets emerges as a new tool with significant potential for landslide susceptibility mapping. The landslide susceptibility map generated by this research aids in the identification of landslide-prone areas, providing a more accurate understanding of associated risks. As a result, it can be instrumental in policy and decision-making processes, enabling the implementation of appropriate measures to mitigate the impact of landslides in the study area.

TI  - The cost of tsetse control using 'Tiny Targets' in the sleeping sickness endemic forest area of Bonon in Cote d'Ivoire: Implications for comparing costs across different settings
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   Work to control the gambiense form of human African trypanosomiasis (gHAT), or sleeping sickness, is now directed towards ending transmission of the parasite by 2030. In order to supplement gHAT case-finding and treatment, since 2011 tsetse control has been implemented using Tiny Targets in a number of gHAT foci. As this intervention is extended to new foci, it is vital to understand the costs involved. Costs have already been analysed for the foci of Arua in Uganda and Mandoul in Chad. This paper examines the costs of controlling Glossina palpalis palpalis in the focus of Bonon in Cote d'Ivoire from 2016 to 2017.
   Methodology/Principal findings
   Some 2000 targets were placed throughout the main gHAT transmission area of 130 km(2) at a density of 14.9 per km(2). The average annual cost was USD 0.5 per person protected, USD 31.6 per target deployed of which 12% was the cost of the target itself, or USD 471.2 per km(2) protected. Broken down by activity, 54% was for deployment and maintenance of targets, 34% for tsetse surveys/monitoring and 12% for sensitising populations.
   Conclusions/Significance
   The cost of tsetse control per km(2) of the gHAT focus protected in Bonon was more expensive than in Chad or Uganda, while the cost per km(2) treated, that is the area where the targets were actually deployed, was cheaper. Per person protected, the Bonon cost fell between the two, with Uganda cheaper and Chad more expensive. In Bonon, targets were deployed throughout the protected area, because G. p. palpalis was present everywhere, whereas in Chad and Uganda G. fuscipes fuscipes was found only the riverine fringing vegetation. Thus, differences between gHAT foci, in terms of tsetse ecology and human geography, impact on the cost-effectiveness of tsetse control. It also demonstrates the need to take into account both the area treated and protected alongside other impact indicators, such as the cost per person protected.
   Author summary
   Sleeping sickness is a fatal disease in Africa caused by trypanosomes transmitted by the bite of infected tsetse flies. The World Health Organization has set the absence of new infections as a goal for 2030. To achieve this, screening and treatment of patients is supplemented by tsetse control. Tiny Targets are small insecticide-impregnated panels of blue cloth and black netting which attract and kill tsetse. To maintain the momentum in these last stages of eliminating the disease, it is important to understand the costs of vector control. This paper presents the results of two years' cost monitoring in Bonon, an area covering 130 km(2), home to 120,000 people. Since 2016, similar to 2,000 Tiny Targets have been deployed annually at a cost of USD 471 per km(2) per year. Bonon is a degraded forested area and a relatively high number of targets was required as tsetse are present throughout. Nevertheless, the cost comes to only USD 0.5 per person protected per year. Compared to operations using Tiny Targets in Uganda and Chad, the cost was higher per km(2) protected, reflecting the need to place targets throughout the area, but low per person protected compared to Chad, highlighting the need to use a range of comparators.

TI  - Advances in the discovery and development of trematocidal drugs
T2  - EXPERT OPINION ON DRUG DISCOVERY
AB  - More than 10% of the world's population are at risk of schistosomiasis and food-borne trematodiasis and an estimated 250 million individuals are infected with the causative agents, namely trematode worms. Yet, schistosomiasis and food-borne trematodiasis are so-called neglected tropical diseases because they affect the poorest people of the world. There are only two drugs available for the treatment and control of schistosomiasis and food-borne trematodiasis, praziquantel and triclabendazole. Discovered in the 1970s and 1980s, these drugs show a good safety profile, are efficacious after administration of single oral doses and have become inexpensive. Because the neglected tropical diseases affect the global poor, there is little incentive for the Western pharmaceutical manufacturers to invest in the development of new trematocidal drugs. Fortunately, we are witnessing a sea change in the neglected tropical disease drug development landscape that should facilitate the discovery, development and deployment of new drugs. This review begins with the pressing need for novel treatment options for major trematode infections. The literature on possible drug targets is then summarised and recent advances in biological screening are put forward. The progress made in trematocidal drug development, particularly the artemisinins, is also reviewed. Finally, postmarketing issues of trematocidal drugs are discussed and the authors conclude that innovative environments for the discovery and development of novel trematocidal drugs have emerged.

TI  - Field ecology of sylvatic <i>Rhodnius</i> populations (Heteroptera, Triatominae):: risk factors for palm tree infestation in western Ecuador
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE & INTERNATIONAL HEALTH
AB  - Most Rhodnius species (Triatominae) are primarily associated with palm trees. They maintain enzootic Trypanosoma cruzi transmission and are responsible for human infection (causing Chagas disease) through the Neotropics. Assessing whether individual palm traits (ecological and/or botanical) may increase the risk of palm infestation by triatomines is relevant in areas where bugs invade houses flying from peridomestic palms. We developed a novel fieldwork approach with that objective, and applied it to study infestation by sylvatic Rhodnius ecuadoriensis in 110 tagua palms (Phytelephas aequatorialis). Palm infestation (23% overall) was non-randomly distributed in our sample. Palms located in anthropic landscapes were frequently infested (> 27%, n = 92), whereas no bugs were collected from palms surveyed within forest remnants (n = 18; P = 0.01). The presence of abundant decaying vegetable matter (P = 0.001) and (to a lesser extent) epiphytic plants (P = 0.049) on palm crowns and stems increased the probability of infestation and was positively correlated with the apparent density of bug colonies (R-2 = 0.68). A trend towards higher infestation rates in male palms (34%vs. 18%) could relate to female palm management (removal of infrutescences and vegetable debris) in areas where palm seeds are harvested. An outline of 'risk palm ecotopes' and environmental management-based strategies for the control of peridomestic, palm tree-living vector populations are proposed.

TI  - Economic, environmental, and natural resource benefits of plastic shelters in vegetable production in a humid tropical environment
T2  - JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
AB  - This paper reports the effectiveness of plastic shelters in overcoming soil-related and biotic constraints to vegetable production in Belize, Central America, where rainy-season tomatoes and sweet peppers are almost totally destroyed by geminiviruses. Use of pesticides is rampant, while rapid decline in soil productivity induces farmers to abandon previously used lands acid clear new lands from virgin forests. We postulated that plants growing in the open-field environment are infected early by the soil-borne pathogens deposited on the plants from clouds of fine soil particles arising from the soil splash during high-intensity rainfall. The products of fungal and bacterial decay attract white flies (the vector for geminiviruses) and plants already weakened by the infection succumb easily to the viruses. A production system in which plant and soil surfaces are protected from direct rainfall using plastic shelters, was designed and field tested with tomatoes and sweet peppers. On average, plastic shelters increased tomato and sweet pepper yields by 169% and 96%, respectively, without any use of pesticides. Weed growth under the shelter was negligible, and plants maintained greenness and production well into the fourth month after transplanting. In contrast, open-field plots were infested with weeds, and plants were completely destroyed by the middle of the third month. The number of white flies visiting the plastic-shelter plants was only about 28% of that in the open-field. We conclude that total protection of soil and plant surfaces from rainfall is the most effective plant protection measure. The proposed system uses small land area on a continuous basis, provides stable production, requires little or no plant protection chemicals, and raises Farmer income.

TI  - Interactions between parasitic helminths and gut microbiota in wild tropical primates from intact and fragmented habitats
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - The mammalian gastrointestinal tract harbours a highly complex ecosystem composed of a variety of micro- (bacteria, fungi, viruses, protozoans) and macro-organisms (helminths). Although most microbiota research focuses on the variation of single gut components, the crosstalk between components is still poorly characterized, especially in hosts living under natural conditions. We investigated the gut micro-biodiversity (bacteria, fungi and helminths) of 158 individuals of two wild non-human primates, the Udzungwa red colobus (Procolobus gordonorum) and the yellow baboon (Papio cynocephalus). These species have contrasting diets and lifestyles, but live sympatrically in both human-impacted and pristine forests in the Udzungwa Mountains of Tanzania. Using non-invasive faecal pellets, helminths were identified using standard microscopy while bacteria and fungi were characterized by sequencing the V1-V3 variable region of the 16S rRNA gene for bacteria and the ITS1-ITS2 fragment for fungi. Our results show that both diversity and composition of bacteria and fungi are associated with variation in helminth presence. Although interactions differed by habitat type, in both primates we found that Strongyloides was negatively associated and Trichuris was positively associated with bacterial and fungal richness. To our knowledge, this is one of the few studies demonstrating an interaction between helminth and gut microbiota communities in wild non-human primates.

TI  - Influence of <i>Chrysoporthe deuterocubensis</i> Canker Disease on the Physical and Mechanical Properties of <i>Eucalyptus urograndis</i>
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Eucalyptus hybrid has been planted rigorously in wet tropical regions including Malaysia. Recently, there was a report on the occurrence of stem canker on these trees. However, the extent of the infections by this stem canker is unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of stem canker disease, Chrysoporthe deuterocubensis, on the physical and mechanical properties of 11-year-old E. urophylla x E. grandis or also known as E. urograndis. The samples were taken from infected and healthy trees that were segregated into different classes based on the severity of the attack, i.e., healthy (class 1), moderately infected (class 2), severely infected (class 3) and very severely infected (class 4). A total of 1440 samples from four infection classes were used in this study. The physical and mechanical properties were determined according to the standard test procedures specified by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 13061:2014 (Parts 1 to 4, 13, 14 and 17) and British Standard (BS 373: 1957). From the result, a significant effect by the infection classes was observed on physical and mechanical properties of E. urograndis. All infected wood experienced less shrinkage compared to that of a healthy one, particularly the volumetric (Vol(sh)) and radial shrinkage (R-sh). Wood from class 2 and class 3 was less affected by the infection while the majority of wood from class 4 had significantly lower density and poorer strength. Based on the strength data, wood from infection class 2 can be considered to be used for non-structural applications such as furniture, interior finishing, window frames and doors since reduction in mechanical properties was observed. Wood from class 3 would need further investigation to examine its suitability for structural applications.

TI  - Predictive spatial models for risk of West Nile virus exposure in eastern and western Colorado
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - In the absence of a vaccine for use in humans against West Nile virus (WNV), mosquito control and personal protection against mosquito bites are the only measures available to prevent disease. Improved spatial targeting is desirable for costly mosquito and WNV surveillance and control schemes. We used a multivariate regression modeling approach to develop spatial models predicting high risk of exposure to WNV in western and eastern Colorado based on associations between Geographic Information System-derived environmental data and zip code of residence for 3,659 human WNV disease cases from 2002 to 2006. Models were robust, with user accuracies for correct classification of high risk areas of 67-80%. The importance of selecting a suitable model development area in an ecologically and climatically diverse environment was shown by models based on data from the eastern plains landscape performing poorly in the mountainous western part of Colorado and vice versa.

TI  - Highly Variable Densities and a Decline in Critically Endangered Golden-Crowned Sifaka (<i>Propithecus tattersalli</i>) Abundance from 2008-2018
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY
AB  - Animal abundance is determined by a number of factors, including vegetation structure, food availability and quality, human activities, predation risk, and disease. Vegetation structure, food availability, and human activity often are used to guide conservation efforts, such as protected area zoning and reforestation, especially for primates. We sought to determine whether Critically Endangered golden-crowned sifaka (Propithecus tattersalli) densities could be predicted across a heterogeneous landscape as a function of vegetation structure, food availability, and human activity. We conducted walking transect surveys across the sifakas' entire global range in Loky-Manambato Protected Area of Madagascar from 2016-2018, expanding upon a study conducted in 2006/2008. Potential predictors of sifaka density included metrics of vegetation structure (e.g., tree density, forest type), food availability (e.g., food tree basal area, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)), and human activity (e.g., tree cutting, livestock grazing). Low-intensity tree cutting and wet season NDVI were the best, positive predictors of sifaka densities. Sifaka densities within study units across their restricted range (880 km(2)) were highly variable (range: 6.8-78.1 sifakas/km(2)), emphasizing the importance of large-scale study designs across all suitable land cover types for assessing a species' abundance, regardless of its area of occupancy. We estimated that 10,222-12,631 sifakas remain. Based on previous surveys, this indicates that populations either remained stable over the past 20 years or have declined by 30-43% in the past 10 years; we argue that a decline is most likely based on our updating of forest cover estimates for both of the prior studies. We also found that wet season NDVI is a positive predictor of sifaka densities, which will aid managers in prioritizing conservation actions in this region using widely available remotely sensed data.

TI  - Ecology of mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) in areas of Serra da Bocaina National Park, Brazil.: I -: Habitat distribution
T2  - REVISTA DE SAUDE PUBLICA
AB  - Objective
   To assess the mosquito fauna in Serra da Bocaina National Park (PNSB), by collecting information through a general survey, and investigating the population behavior in habitats within the park with different vegetation.
   Methods
   Human bait collections conduct once a month for both the forest and households, in diurnal and nocturnal periods, three time a day, throughout 24 months, from January 1991 to December 1992.
   Results
   A total of 11,808 adult mosquitoes belonging to 28 species were collected. Runchomyia reversa and Anopheles cruzii were the most abundant, reaching 52.2% and 17.9% of the total collected specimens, respectively. In the dense forest, Ru. reversa comprised 59.4$ of the total, followed by Ru. frontosa with 10.5%, and An. cruzii with 9.9%. In the high altitude fields and in gallery forest, An. cruzii was the most abundant (48.1%) followed by Ru. reversa (28.1%). Inside households An. cruzii was also the most prominent species, representing 73.7% of the total for that location. Conquillettidia chrysonotum was the only species mainly seen in the household surroundings, where irs distribution was: 14.9% (indoors), 19.4% (close to th house), and 65.7% (outdoors). An. cruzii and Ru. reversa were found throughout the whole year and captured every month.
   Conclusions
   Mosquitoes in PNSB present an assynanthropic behavior, for Cq. chrysonotum which lives preferentially in the household environment. Though An. cruzii is an assynantropic species it may approaches live near households and even invades and infest them for the blood meals. The occurrence of Aedes serratus in the household vicinity emphasizes its epidemiological important as a potential vector of arboviruses. Sabethini are all exclusively sylvatic species.

TI  - Emerging Forest Diseases: A Case Study of Greenheart (<i>Chlorocardium</i> spp., Lauraceae) and the Newly Described Fungus, <i>Xylaria karyophthora</i>
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Greenheart (Chlorocardium spp., Lauraceae) is one of Guyana's most economically important timber species. It is a large evergreen canopy tree with desirable wood characteristics and no previously recorded pathogens. Recently, however, the fungal species Xylaria karyophthora was described from morbid Greenheart seeds found throughout central Guyana. For years, forestry stakeholders have postulated that the future of Greenheart in Guyana is threatened due to overharvesting. However, X. karyophthora may represent a new immediate threat to the Greenheart industry. The exact time of emergence of this fungus is unclear, although our examination of historical records indicates that it was sometime before 2000. In this review, we discuss the history of key silvicultural and mycological research in relation to Greenheart in Guyana and the threats to its production.

TI  - ROLE OF LANDSCAPE ELEMENTS ON RECENT DISTRIBUTIONAL EXPANSION OF EUROPEAN STARLINGS (<i>STURNUS</i> <i>VULGARIS</i>) IN AGROECOSYSTEMS OF THE PAMPAS, ARGENTINA
T2  - WILSON JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY
AB  - Previous studies of European Starlings in Argentina have focused on identifying biological aspects correlated with establishment of new populations in urban and suburban areas. Starlings have recently invaded rural areas in the Pampas. To understand the factors involved in the recent expansion of European Starlings into these rural habitats, we investigated how expansion patterns were associated with season, proportion of crop fields, distance to woodlots, and distance to small and big urban centers in agroecoystems of the Pampas. We surveyed 392 fields during 2011-2013 to collect data on presence of starlings and landscape features. We found that the range of European Starlings has expanded by a total area of similar to 65,000 km(2) since 2005, at a linear range expansion rate of 22.2 km per year. Generalized linear mixed model analysis revealed that presence of European Starlings was significantly related with reduced distances to nearest small urban area. Our findings indicate that range expansion of European Starlings into rural areas of Argentina may follow a neighborhood diffusion pattern, by which well-established populations act as sources of individuals that disperse short distances into nearby favorable areas. In absence of human control, this species is expected to continue its spread and population increase.

TI  - EVIDENCE IMPLICATING NYMPHAL IXODES PACIFICUS (ACARI, IXODIDAE) IN THE EPIDEMIOLOGY OF LYME-DISEASE IN CALIFORNIA
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - To clarify the role of nymphal versus adult western black-legged ticks (Ixodes pacificus) in the epidemiology of Lyme disease, the seasonal distribution, abundance, and spirochetal infection rates in these stages, and the seasonal occurrence of ticks biting humans and of incident cases of Lyme disease were determined in northern California. Although their seasonal activity periods overlapped for about one-third of the year, nymphs and adults predominated in different seasons, the former from late spring to summer and the latter from fall to early spring. At one site, four (4%) of 100 adults from low vegetation bordering a hardwood forest and 44 (13.6%) of 324 nymphs from leaf litter in the forest were found to contain Borrelia burgdorferi. Biting-collection records revealed that nymphs attach to people more commonly than recognized previously; I. pacificus nymphs comprised 12.5% of 967 ticks of various species and stages and 42% of all nymphs submitted for identification. Attachments by nymphs occurred primarily between April and August, which coincided with the seasonal occurrence of most incident cases of Lyme disease. Collectively, these findings strongly implicate the nymphal stage of I. pacificus as the primary vector of B. burgdorferi to humans in this region.

TI  - Prevalence of simian malaria among macaques in Malaysia (2000-2021): A systematic review
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   The aim of Malaysia to eliminate malaria nationwide by 2020 seems need to be prolonged. Whilst Malaysia has successfully eliminated human malaria transmission, simian malaria parasites such as Plasmodium knowlesi, P. cynomolgi, P. inui and P. cynomolgi are the emerging cause of malaria in humans. The epidemiological study of simian malaria in primates provides useful information in identifying the risk of human-macaques Plasmodium infection.
   Methodology/Principal findings This study was performed to gather all available data in terms of simian malaria epidemiology study among macaques in Malaysia over the last two decades. This systematic review was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines to select appropriate articles as references. Data searches were performed through international databases such as Google Scholar, PubMed, CrossRef, Scopus, Web of Science and Science Direct for original articles published from 2000 until 2021. The review identified seven simian malaria epidemiology studies in Malaysia over the 20-year study period. Most studies were conducted in Peninsular Malaysia (5/7; 71%) followed by East Malaysia (2/7; 29%). All studies showed positive detection of Plasmodium parasites in macaques. The most prevalent Plasmodium species in macaques was P. inui (49.27%) and the least prevalent was P. fieldi (4.76%). The prevalence of simian malaria was higher in East Malaysia compared to Peninsular Malaysia. The mono, dual and triple infection types were the most common among macaques.
   Conclusion/Significance
   The non-human primates like macaques are the reservoir of simian plasmodium in Malaysia. Hence, the study of host epidemiology is an important insight to public health management as there is a high occurrence of simian malaria in Malaysia. The right measurement can be taken as well to prevent the transmission of simian malaria from macaques to humans.
   Author summary
   Macaques are the most abundant primates in south east Asia including Malaysia. Due to deforestation, macaques came closer to human settlements searching for food. Macaques like the long-tailed and pig-tailed harbouring several Plasmodium species that can cause zoonotic malaria in humans. Close contact of human and macaques cause zoonotic transmission of simian malaria. The simian plasmodium such as P. knowlesi, P. inui and P. cynomolgi have been found infecting humans in Malaysia; mainly in East Malaysia (Borneo). Zoonotic malaria poses great risk to public health as prolonged in treatment often lead to fatal outcomes. Hence the knowledge of prevalence and diversity is important to access, this can therefore enlighten the authorities to plan a control strategy that will minimize the zoonotic transmission between non-human primate host to human. This systematic review has summarised all publish data of macaques-plasmodium infection from the year 2000-2021 by using PRISMA guidelines. Our result showed that P. inui (49.27%) is the most prevalent Plasmodium species found in macaques, followed by P. cynomolgi (33.05%) and P. knowlesi (26.86%). Simian plasmodium prevalent was also found higher in East Malaysia (97.0%) compared to Peninsular Malaysia (45.18%). The significant increase of simian malaria incidences in human have jeopardized the national malaria elimination programme. Hence, this study provides a compact insight into the plasmodium epidemiology of macaques in Malaysia.

TI  - Genetic diversity of Alkhurma hemorrhagic fever virus in Western Asia
T2  - INFECTION GENETICS AND EVOLUTION
AB  - Alkhurma hemorrhagic fever, caused by Alkhurma hemorrhagic fever virus (ALKV), is an arboviral infection which is further expanding in tropical and subtropical regions of the Western Asia. A number of Alkhurma hemorrhagic fever virus (ALKV) strains have been isolated from clinical cases representing Saudi Arabia and Egypt; however, the phylogenetic relationship of these particular isolates to those reported previously elsewhere in the world remains elusive. Based on the analysis of the envelope (E), and non-structural gene (NS3 and NS5), the phylogenetic and PASC analysis revealed the circulation of three sub-lineages (I-III) suggesting a continuous evolution. Also, the comparative genome analysis revealed the envelope gene to be a reliable genetic marker to elucidate the molecular epidemiology and genetic diversity of discrete strains of ALKV.

TI  - Soil quality estimation using environmental covariates and predictive models: an example from tropical soils of Nigeria
T2  - ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES
AB  - Background: Information addressing soil quality in developing countries often depends on results from small experimental plots, which are later extrapolated to vast areas of agricultural land. This approach often results in misinformation to end-users of land for sustainable soil nutrient management. The objective of this study was to estimate the spatial variability of soil quality index (SQI) at regional scale with predictive models using soil-environmental covariates.
   Methods: A total of 110 composite soil samples (0-30 cm depth) were collected by stratified random sampling schemes at 2-5 km intervals across the Cross River State, Nigeria, and selected soil physical and chemical properties were determined. We employed environmental covariates derived from a digital elevation model (DEM) and Sentinel-2 imageries for our modelling regime. We measured soil quality using two approaches [total data set (TDS) and minimum data set (MDS)]. Two scoring functions were also applied, linear (L) and non-linear (NL), yielding four indices (MDS_L, MDS_NL,TDS_L, and TDS_NL). Eleven soil quality indicators were used as TDS and were further screened for MDS using principal component analysis (PCA). Random forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR), regression kriging (RK), Cubist regression, and geographically weighted regression (GWR) were applied to predict SQI in unsampled locations.
   Results: The computed SQI via MDS_L was classified into five classes: <= 0.38, 0.38-0.48, 0.48-0.58, 0.58-0.68, and >= 0.68, representing very low (class V), low (class IV), moderate (class III), high (class II) and very high (class I) soil quality, respectively. GWR model was robust in predicting soil quality (R-2 =0.21, CCC= 0.39, RMSE =0.15), while RF was a model with inferior performance (R-2 =0.02, CCC= 0.32, RMSE = 0.15). Soil quality was high in the southern region and low in the northern region. High soil quality class (>49%) and moderate soil quality class (>14%) dominate the study area in all predicted models used.
   Conclusions: Structural stability index, sand content, soil oganic carbon content, and mean weight diameter of aggregates were the parameters used in establishing regional soil quality indices, while land surface water index, Sentinel-2 near-infrared band, plane curvature, and clay index were the most important variables affecting soil quality variability. The MDS_L and GWR are effective and useful models to identify the key soil properties for assessing soil quality, which can provide guidance for site-specific management of soils developed on diverse parent materials.

TI  - Human Risk of Infection with <i>Borrelia burgdorferi</i>, the Lyme Disease Agent, in Eastern United States
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - The geographic pattern of human risk for infection with Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto, the tick-borne pathogen that causes Lyme disease, was mapped for the eastern United States. The map is based on standardized field sampling in 304 sites of the density of Ixodes scapularis host-seeking nymphs infected with B. burgdorferi, which is closely associated with human infection risk. Risk factors for the presence and density of infected nymphs were used to model a continuous 8 km x 8 km resolution predictive surface of human risk, including confidence intervals for each pixel. Discontinuous Lyme disease risk foci were identified in the Northeast and upper Midwest, with a transitional zone including sites with uninfected I. scapularis populations. Given frequent under- and over-diagnoses of Lyme disease, this map could act as a tool to guide surveillance, control, and prevention efforts and act as a baseline for studies tracking the spread of infection.

TI  - From Lab to Field: The Influence of Urban Landscapes on the Invasive Potential of <i>Wolbachia</i> in Brazilian <i>Aedes aegypti</i> Mosquitoes
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   The symbiotic bacterium Wolbachia is currently being trialled as a biocontrol agent in several countries to reduce dengue transmission. Wolbachia can invade and spread to infect all individuals within wild mosquito populations, but requires a high rate of maternal transmission, strong cytoplasmic incompatibility and low fitness costs in the host in order to do so. Additionally, extensive differences in climate, field-release protocols, urbanization level and human density amongst the sites where this bacterium has been deployed have limited comparison and analysis of Wolbachia's invasive potential.
   Methodology/Principal Findings
   We examined key phenotypic effects of the wMel Wolbachia strain in laboratory Aedes aegypti mosquitoes with a Brazilian genetic background to characterize its invasive potential. We show that the wMel strain causes strong cytoplasmic incompatibility, a high rate of maternal transmission and has no evident detrimental effect on host fecundity or fertility. Next, to understand the effects of different urban landscapes on the likelihood of mosquito survival, we performed mark-release-recapture experiments using Wolbachia-uninfected Brazilian mosquitoes in two areas of Rio de Janeiro where Wolbachia will be deployed in the future. We characterized the mosquito populations in relation to the socio-demographic conditions at these sites, and at three other future release areas. We then constructed mathematical models using both the laboratory and field data, and used these to describe the influence of urban environmental conditions on the likelihood that the Wolbachia infection frequency could reach 100% following mosquito release. We predict successful invasion at all five field sites, however the conditions by which this occurs vary greatly between sites, and are strongly influenced by the size of the local mosquito population.
   Conclusions/Significance
   Through analysis of laboratory, field and mathematical data, we show that the wMel strain of Wolbachia possesses the characteristics required to spread effectively in different urban socio-demographic environments in Rio de Janeiro, including those where mosquito releases from the Eliminate Dengue Program will take place.

TI  - Implementation of bamboo and monkey-pot traps for the sampling cavity-breeding mosquitoes in Darien, Panama
T2  - ACTA TROPICA
AB  - Despite the importance of Aedes, Haemagogus and Sabethes in the transmission of yellow fever virus (YFV) and the public health impacts of recent YFV epidemics in the Americas, relatively little has been reported on the biology and ecology of these vectors. Many Aedes, Haemagogus and Sabethes spp. in the American tropics inhabit and develop in the forest canopy and are difficult to sample with conventional entomological surveillance methods. We tested the utility of two previously developed phytotelmata-style oviposition traps (bamboo Guadua angustifolia) and (monkey-pot Lecythis minor), for collecting immature forms of these mosquitoes in a forest near the community of Aruza Abajo, Darien Province, Panama. Our results showed distribution of mosquito species emerging from the two types of traps was found to be significantly different (X-2 = 210.23; df = 14; P < 0.001), with significantly greater numbers of Sabethes (Peytonulus) aurescens (Lutz) and Sabethes (Peytonulus) undosus (Coquillett) emerging from the bamboo traps. More females of Sabethes (Sabethes) cyaneus (Fabricius) were captured in the monkey-pot traps, although the difference was not significant. No differences were observed in the average time to emergence for the two traps. These results suggest that various phytotelmata-style traps, including monkey-pot and bamboo, could be used to improve entomological surveillance of YFV vectors in the American tropic.

TI  - Horse Flies (Diptera: Tabanidae) in Mangrove Forests and Estuarine Floodplains on Marajo Island, Brazil
T2  - NEOTROPICAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - Tabanids constitute an important group of hematophagous insects that can transmit zoonoses, but with studies on the ecological distribution of species still neglected in the Amazon. We evaluated the role of mangrove forests and estuarine floodplains located inside and outside a conservation unit (UC) on the coast of Marajo Island, Amazon River estuary, on the diversity and distribution of tabanids. Specifically, we studied whether the community of mangrove and estuarine floodplain tabanids located inside and outside the UC differ in abundance, richness, and species composition. We collected tabanids using a Malaise trap at 40 sampling points, resulting in 637 specimens distributed in 13 species and one morphotype, representing approximately 37% of the tabanid fauna ever recorded for the Marajo Island. There was no significant difference in the richness and composition of tabanids between the phytophysiognomies, but the abundance was significantly different, with greater abundance in the mangrove. The areas inside and around the UC had an influence on the tabanids, with the areas inside the UC having the highest number of specimens and species, also influencing the species composition. Two species are new records for the Marajo Island, bringing the number of species recorded to 38. Our results suggest that, along the Amazonian coast, mangroves and estuarine floodplains maintain part of the diversity of tabanids known for the Brazilian Amazon. Our data also indicate that the region's UC provides potentially important habitats for the maintenance of local tabanid populations.

TI  - Rapid introgression of non-native alleles following hybridization between a native <i>Anolis</i> lizard species and a cryptic invader across an urban landscape
T2  - MOLECULAR ECOLOGY
AB  - Invasive species can impact native populations through competition, predation, habitat alteration, and disease transmission, but also genetically through hybridization. Potential outcomes of hybridization span the continuum from extinction to hybrid speciation and can be further complicated by anthropogenic habitat disturbance. Hybridization between the native green anole lizard (Anolis carolinensis) and a morphologically similar invader (A. porcatus) in south Florida provides an ideal opportunity to study interspecific admixture across a heterogeneous landscape. We used reduced-representation sequencing to describe introgression in this hybrid system and to test for a relationship between urbanization and non-native ancestry. Our findings indicate that hybridization between green anole lineages was probably a limited, historic event, producing a hybrid population characterized by a diverse continuum of ancestry proportions. Genomic cline analyses revealed rapid introgression and disproportionate representation of non-native alleles at many loci and no evidence for reproductive isolation between parental species. Three loci were associated with urban habitat characteristics; urbanization and non-native ancestry were positively correlated, although this relationship did not remain significant when accounting for spatial nonindependence. Ultimately, our study demonstrates the persistence of non-native genetic material even in the absence of ongoing immigration, indicating that selection favouring non-native alleles can override the demographic limitation of low propagule pressure. We also note that not all outcomes of admixture between native and non-native species should be considered intrinsically negative. Hybridization with ecologically robust invaders can lead to adaptive introgression, which may facilitate the long-term survival of native populations otherwise unable to adapt to anthropogenically mediated global change.

TI  - Mosquito repellents for malaria prevention
T2  - COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS
AB  - Background
   Malaria is an important cause of illness and death across endemic regions. Considerable success against malaria has been achieved within the past decade mainly through long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs). However, elimination of the disease is proving difficult as current control methods do not protect against mosquitoes biting outdoors and when people are active. Repellents may provide a personal protection solution during these times.
   Objectives
   To assess the impact of topical repellents, insecticide-treated clothing, and spatial repellents on malaria transmission.
   Search methods
   We searched the following databases up to 26 June 2017: the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; the Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), published in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE; Embase; US AFPMB; CAB Abstracts; and LILACS. We also searched trial registration platforms and conference proceedings; and contacted organizations and companies for ongoing and unpublished trials.
   Selection criteria
   We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster-randomized controlled trials of topical repellents proven to repel mosquitoes; permethrin-treated clothing; and spatial repellents such as mosquito coils. We included trials that investigated the use of repellents with or without LLINs, referred to as insecticide-treated nets.
   Data collection and analysis
   Two review authors independently reviewed trials for inclusion, extracted the data, and assessed the risk of bias. A third review author resolved any discrepancies. We analysed data by conducting meta-analysis and stratified by whether the trials had included LLINs. We combined results from cRCTs with individually RCTs by adjusting for clustering and presented results using forest plots. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence.
   Main results
   Eight cRCTs and two RCTs met the inclusion criteria. Six trials investigated topical repellents, two trials investigated insecticide-treated clothing, and two trials investigated spatial repellents.
   Topical repellents
   Six RCTS, five of them cluster-randomized, investigated topical repellents involving residents of malaria-endemic regions. Four trials used topical repellents in combination with nets, but two trials undertaken in displaced populations used topical repellents alone. It is unclear if topical repellents can prevent clinical malaria (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.4 to 1.07, very low certainty evidence) or malaria infection (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.12, low-certainty evidence) caused by P fakiparum. It is also unclear if there is any protection against clinical cases of P vivax (RR 1.32, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.76, low-certainty evidence) or incidence of infections (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.41, low-certainty evidence). Subgroup analysis of trials including insecticide-treated nets did not show a protective effect of topical repellents against malaria. Only two studies did not include insecticide-treated nets, and they measured different outcomes; one reported a protective effect against clinical cases of P falciparum (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.71); but the other study measured no protective effect against malaria infection incidence caused by either P falciparum or P vivax.
   Insecticide-treated clothing
   Insecticide-treated clothing were investigated in trials conducted in refugee camps in Pakistan and amongst military based in the Colombian Amazon. Neither study provided participants with insecticide-treated nets. In the absence of nets, treated clothing may reduce the incidence of clinical malaria caused by P falciparum by approximately 50% (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.83, low-certainty evidence) and P vivax (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.01, low-certainty evidence).
   Spatial repellents
   Two cluster-randomized RCTs investigated mosquito coils for malaria prevention. We do not know the effect of spatial repellents on malaria prevention (RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.03 to 1.72, very low certainty evidence). There was large heterogeneity between studies and one study had high risk of bias.
   Authors' conclusions
   There is insufficient evidence to conclude topical or spatial repellents can prevent malaria. There is a need for better designed trials to generate higher certainty of evidence before well-informed recommendations can be made. Adherence to daily compliance remains a major limitation. Insecticide-treated clothing may reduce risk of malaria infection in the absence of insecticide-treated nets; further studies on insecticide-treated clothing in the general population should be done to broaden the applicability of the results.

TI  - Impact of meteorological anomalies in the 2003 summer on Gross Primary Productivity in East Asia
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
AB  - Northern Eurasia experienced anomalous weather conditions in the 2003 summer. We examined how forest ecosystems responded to the meteorological anomalies during the period using the dataset collected at flux monitoring sites in Asia, including a boreal forest in Mongolia, temperate forests in China and Japan, and a sub-tropical forest in China, as well as the dataset from satellite remote sensing. From July to August 2003, an active rain band stayed in the mid-latitude in East Asia for an unusually long period. Under the influence of the rain band, the Gross Primary Production (GPP), of temperate forests was 20-30% lower in the 2003 summer than in other years due to significant reduction in the Photosynthetic Photon Flux Density (PPFD). The GPP of a cool-temperate forest in the north of the rain band was slightly enhanced by the higher PPFD; however, the GPP of a sub-tropical forest located in the south of the rain band was reduced by drought stress due to extremely hot and dry conditions. The correlation coefficients for the year-to-year changes in the PPFD and GPP during mid-summer were calculated, and the spatial distribution was examined. The spatial pattern of the PPFD was calculated by satellite data, and that of the GPP was estimated by a regression-type model, which was trained and tested by ground observation data. The correlation was positive in the mid- and high-latitudes since light was an essential factor of the summer GPP. On the other hand, a negative correlation appeared in the lower latitudes, suggesting that the water limitation was much more important than the PPFD in the region. Our study illustrated that the integration of flux data from wide areas by combining satellite remote sensing data can help us gain an understanding of the ecosystem responses to large-scale meteorological phenomena.

TI  - SVM Selective Fusion (SELF) for Multi-Source Classification of Structurally Complex Tropical Rainforest
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Accuracy of land cover classification is generally improved by inputting multi-sensory and GIS data since complex vegetation type identification benefits from synergism of complementary information. However, multi-source fusion can also deteriorate accuracy when some classes do not benefit from all sources. On the basis of this premise, we introduce a Selective Fusion (SELF) scheme based on Support Vector Machines (SVM) which use a single source for source-specific classes and fuse all sources for classes considered as "in difficulty". Our method yields better overall accuracy and Kappa than the classical systematic approach since it takes advantage of the accuracy achieved by SVM and its ability to weight numerous and heterogeneous sources without the drawback of being sensible to irrelevant data for source-specific classes. This operational method can be used efficiently to enhance accuracy when analyzing the wealth of information available from remote sensing products.

TI  - Epidemiology of podoconiosis in Ethiopia: a systematic review and meta-analysis protocol
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Introduction
   Podoconiosis is a non-filarial swelling of the lower extremity endemic in tropical regions, North America and India. The aetiology and pathophysiology of the disease remain unknown. We propose conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the burden and risk factors of podoconiosis in Ethiopia reported in studies from 2009 to 2019.
   Methods and analysis
   We will search the following electronic databases: PubMed (MEDLINE), EMBASE, Hinari, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, ISI (Web of Science) and Google Scholar. Medical subject headings will be used to extensively search relevant literature on electronic databases using related keywords such as epidemiology or prevalence, magnitude or burden, podoconiosis, and Ethiopia. Grey literature and manual search will also be performed to retrieve unindexed research articles. Two reviewers will screen all retrieved articles, conduct data extraction and then critically appraise all identified studies. We will analyse data using STATA V.14 statistical software. We will demonstrate pooled estimates of podoconiosis and associated factors with effect size and 95% CI. The presence of heterogeneity among studies will be examined by forest plot as well as the I-2 heterogeneity test. Potential causes of heterogeneity will be explored by carrying out sensitivity and subgroup analyses. The presence of publication bias will also be examined by observing funnel plots and objectively by Egger's regression test. If the funnel plot is asymmetric and/or Egger's test was found to be statistically significant (p<0.05), the trim and fill (Duval and Tweedie's) analysis will be performed.
   Ethics and dissemination
   The study will use publicly available data and will not identify the authors of the publication by name. In light of these and as has been indicated, research ethics clearance is not required for evidence syntheses in such reviews. The results of this study will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and presented at national and international conferences.

TI  - Comparative Assessment of Various Machine Learning-Based Bias Correction Methods for Numerical Weather Prediction Model Forecasts of Extreme Air Temperatures in Urban Areas
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
AB  - Forecasts of maximum and minimum air temperatures are essential to mitigate the damage of extreme weather events such as heat waves and tropical nights. The Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model has been widely used for forecasting air temperature, but generally it has a systematic bias due to its coarse grid resolution and lack of parametrizations. This study used random forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR), artificial neural network (ANN) and a multi-model ensemble (MME) to correct the Local Data Assimilation and Prediction System (LDAPS; a local NWP model over Korea) model outputs of next-day maximum and minimum air temperatures ( Tmaxt+1 and Tmint+1) in Seoul, South Korea. A total of 14 LDAPS model forecast data, the daily maximum and minimum air temperatures of in-situ observations, and five auxiliary data were used as input variables. The results showed that the LDAPS model had an R-2 of 0.69, a bias of -0.85 degrees C and an RMSE of 2.08 degrees C for Tmaxt+1 forecast, whereas the proposed models resulted in the improvement with R-2 from 0.75 to 0.78, bias from -0.16 to -0.07 degrees C and RMSE from 1.55 to 1.66 degrees C by hindcast validation. For forecasting Tmint+1, the LDAPS model had an R-2 of 0.77, a bias of 0.51 degrees C and an RMSE of 1.43 degrees C by hindcast, while the bias correction models showed R-2 values ranging from 0.86 to 0.87, biases from -0.03 to 0.03 degrees C, and RMSEs from 0.98 to 1.02 degrees C. The MME model had better generalization performance than the three single machine learning models by hindcast validation and leave-one-station-out cross-validation.

TI  - Effects of soil types and fertility management practices on soil silicon availability and banana silicon uptake
T2  - SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT NUTRITION
AB  - Although silicon (Si) is one of soil abundant constituents and one of the key elements enhancing plant disease resistance, banana uptake of Si is limited by soil Si availability. It remains unclear what factors regulates soil Si availability and whether banana Si uptake increases with increasing soil Si availability in home garden soils. To test whether soil Si availability and banana leaf SiO2 contents are affected by soil types or fertility management practices, we measured (1) banana leaf SiO2 contents along the gradient of livestock inputs in Andisols of Tanzania and (2) water extractable Si, phosphate-buffer extractable Si, and banana leaf SiO2 in the home garden soils with different degree of volcanic ash admixing and with/without leguminous trees in Indonesia (East Java and East Kalimantan). Livestock dung application increased banana leaf SiO2 contents in the Tanzanian home gardens. Water extractable Si increased with increasing soil pH, but soil phosphate-buffer extractable Si and banana leaf SiO2 contents were strongly regulated by oxalate-extractable Si and andic properties in the Indonesian home gardens. Effects of companion trees (agroforestry) increased banana leaf SiO2 only in two of three Andisols (Java). These results suggest that banana leaf SiO2 contents could be primarily regulated by admixing degree of volcanic parent materials rich in weatherable minerals, but that banana leaf SiO2 contents could also be increased by inputs of livestock dung rich in Si (Tanzania) and agroforestry (Indoensia).

TI  - Detection of banana plants and their major diseases through aerial images and machine learning methods: A case study in DR Congo and Republic of Benin
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Front-line remote sensing tools, coupled with machine learning (ML), have a significant role in crop monitoring and disease surveillance. Crop type classification and a disease early warning system are some of these remote sensing applications that provide precise, timely, and cost-effective information at different spatial, temporal, and spectral resolutions. To our knowledge, most disease surveillance systems focus on a single-sensor based solutions and lagging the integration of multiple information sources. Moreover, monitoring larger landscapes using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are challenging, and, therefore combining high resolution satellite imagery data with advanced machine learning (ML) models through the use of mobile apps could help detect and classify banana plants and provide more information on its overall health status. In this study, we classified banana under mixed-complex African landscapes through pixel-based classifications and ML models derived from multi-level satellite images (Sentinel 2, PlanetScope and WorldView-2) and UAV (MicaSense RedEdge) platforms. Our pixel-based classification from random forest (RF) model using combined features of vegetation indices (VIs) and principal component analysis (PCA) showed up to 97% overall accuracy (OA) with less than 10% omission and commission errors (OE and CE) and Kappa coefficient of 0.96 in high resolution multispectral images. We used UAV-RGB aerial images from DR Congo and Republic of Benin fields to develop a mixed-model system combining object detection model (RetinaNet) and a custom classifier for simultaneous banana localization and disease classification. Their accuracies were tested using different performance metrics. Our UAV-RGB mixed-model revealed that the developed object detection and classification model successfully classified healthy and diseased plants with 99.4%, 92.8%, 93.3% and 90.8% accuracy for the four classes: banana bunchy top disease (BBTD), Xanthomonas Wilt of Banana (BXW), healthy banana cluster and individual banana plants, respectively. These approaches of aerial image-based ML models have high potential to provide a decision support system for major banana diseases in Africa.

TI  - A STUDY OF ONCHOCERCIASIS WITH SEVERE SKIN AND EYE LESIONS IN A HYPERENDEMIC ZONE IN THE FOREST OF SOUTHWESTERN CAMEROON - CLINICAL, PARASITOLOGICAL, AND ENTOMOLOGIC FINDINGS
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Prior to the initiation of an onchocerciasis control program based on the mass administration of ivermectin in the rain forest of southwestern Cameroon, a preliminary baseline study of the area was conducted. The results of this study showed that onchocerciasis was hyperendemic in the area. Skin symptoms and signs were observed including pruritus (67.4% of the population examined), onchocerca nodules (51.6%), skin depigmentation (18.5%), and hanging groins (5.7%). Except for pruritus, the prevalence of these symptoms increased with age. Of the eyes examined, 44.9% had microfilariae in the anterior chamber, 33.5% had choroidoretinitis, 28.0% had punctate keratitis, 8.3% had papillary abnormalities, and 3.6% had sclerosing keratitis. Vision in 10.5% of the eyes examined was classified as blind or very poor (visual acuity = 0-0.10), in 15.7% as poor (visual acuity = 0.11-0.39), and in 73.8% as good (visual acuity = 0.4-1.00). Unlike previous reports that have linked serious ocular damage mainly to savanna onchocerciasis, the present study showed that forest onchocerciasis also caused significant ocular pathology, including blindness. Parasitologically, positive skin snips were recorded for 92.7% of the persons examined, with both sexes being equally infected. The parasite load, expressed as the geometric mean number of microfilariae per skin snip, was 53.6, and was much higher in males than in females. The fly vector, Simulium squamosum, had a high infection rate of 7.5% infective females in Bakumba and 6.8% infective females in Ngbandi, the two fly-catching points. The transmission potential was 266 infective larvae per person per month in Bakumba and 189 in Ngbandi.

TI  - Species Diversity and Abundance of <i>Anopheles</i> (<i>Nyssorhynchus</i>) (Diptera: Culicidae) in Cachoeiras de Macacu Municipality, Rio de Janeiro State: An Area of the Atlantic Forest Receptive and Vulnerable to Malaria
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - The present study evaluated the diversity of Anopheles Meigen, 1818 belonging to the subgenus Nyssorhynchus Blanchard, 1902 in four areas of Cachoeiras de Macacu municipality, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The immature collections were carried out during a rainy period and a post-rainy season. During the two periods, 3,932 specimens of Anopheles (Nyssorhynchus) were collected: 562 in the rainy period (14.29%) and 3,370 in the post-rainy period (85.70%). Among 3,932 specimens collected during both periods, 489 were identified, 50 (8.89%) in the rainy period and 439 (13.02%) in the post-rainy period. Nine Anopheles species were recorded: Anopheles albitarsis Lynch Arribalzaga, 1878 s.l. (76.86%), An. braziliensis (Chagas, 1907) (17%); An. evansae (Brethes, 1926) (8, 48%); An. triannulatus (Neiva & Pinto, 1922) s.l. (8.23%); An. oswaldoi (Peryassu, 1922) (6.43%); An. strodei Root, 1926 (5.40%); An. argyritarsis Robineau-Desvoidy, 1827 (1.54%); An. rangeli Gabaldon et al., 1940 (1.28%); and An. aquasalis Curry, 1932 (0.51%). Among them, An. albitarsis was dominant and abundant in 93.75% of the collection points. Our results show a diverse Anopheles fauna in the municipality of Cachoeiras de Macacu, with a strong association of occurrence between An. rangeli and An. oswaldoi; An. rangeli and An. evansae; An. evansae and An. oswaldoi; and An. albitarsis s.l. and An. braziliensis during the rainy period. However, there was a weak correlation in the post-rainy period, except between An. rangeli and An. oswaldoi and between An. triannulatus and An. aquasalis, which displayed a moderate linear correlation. Our results suggest that following a potential reintroduction of malaria Cachoeiras de Macacu, local transmission of Plasmodium Marchiafava & Celli, 1885 may be enhanced by the presence of nine Nyssorhynchus species (all potential malaria vectors).

TI  - <i>In vitro</i> interaction between <i>Phlebiopsis</i> sp and <i>Ganoderma philippii</i> isolates
T2  - FOREST PATHOLOGY
AB  - Ganoderma philippii causes root-rot disease in a wide range of commercial perennial woody crops such as rubber and tropical acacias. In terms of productivity loss, the disease is considered as the most economically damaging disease of Acacia mangium. Many strategies to manage root rot have been developed and applied, including application of biological control which has focused on species and strains of the ascomycete genus Trichoderma. This research aimed to test the potential of a wood-rotting basidiomycete as a biocontrol agent for root rot caused by Ganoderma philippii. This basidiomycete was isolated from a Eucalyptus pellita stump in a coppicing trial in Riau province, central Sumatra. DNA sequence analysis indicated that this isolate is most likely a Phlebiopsis sp. In vitro tests and microscopic morphological description of mycelial interactions between the Phlebiopsis and G.philippii isolates showed a mycoparasitic reaction. This result offered an alternative potential fungal isolate for root-rot management in Indonesia as Phlebiopsis gigantea is already successfully used as a biocontrol agent for managing root rot caused by Heterobasidion annosum throughout pine forests in Europe and North America.

TI  - Epidemiological Characteristics and Spatial Analysis of Tick-Borne Encephalitis in Jilin Province, China
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is a viral infectious disease and has become a reemerging public health threat in recent years in northeastern China. However, no studies has characterized the epidemiologic features and explored the spatial dynamics and environmental factors of TBE cases in Jilin Province. In this study, we have described the epidemiological features of 846 reported human TBE cases from 2006 to 2016 in Jilin Province. There was an obvious single peak pattern of TBE cases from May to July in Jilin Province. More than 60% of TBE cases occurred in farmers, and the people in 50- to 59-year-old group had the high incidence of the disease. The results of Getis-Ord Gi* statistics demonstrated that the human TBE cases were more clustered in the northeastern border including Dunhua and Yanji cities and Antu and Wangqing counties, and southern areas including Huinan, Jingyu, Jiangyuan, and Liuhe counties in Jilin Province. We demonstrated that the temporal dynamics of TBE in Jilin was significantly associated with the dynamics of meteorological factors especially after 2009. The results from the auto-logistic regression analysis showed that the percentage coverage of forest, temperature, and autoregressive term were significantly associated with the occurrence of human TBE cases in Jilin Province. Our findings will provide a scientific evidence for the targeted prevention and control programs.

TI  - A review of nutrient, water and organic matter dynamics of tropical acacias on mineral soils for improved management in Southeast Asia
T2  - AUSTRALIAN FORESTRY
AB  - More than 3 000 000ha of tropical acacias have been established in recent decades, mostly grown on short rotations of 4-7years, by a range of growers, from smallholders in Vietnam with less than 5ha to large industrial growers in Sumatra managing hundreds of thousands of hectares. While the acacia estate is declining in some areas due to disease susceptibility, it is still expanding in other areas, and acacias would probably be the preferred species in many areas if the disease issues can be overcome. To date, many of the silvicultural management practices have largely been based on operational trial and error rather than backed by scientific evidence. To ensure sustained production, a deeper understanding of the mechanism for the response of acacias to management and environment is required. The objective of this paper is to review recent advances in our knowledge of the nutrient, water and organic matter dynamics of acacia plantations on mineral soils in Southeast Asia. We show that water availability is a key factor influencing productivity in many locations, but also that there are options for new approaches to management, including regional and site selection (or choice to plant or not on any given plot of land), and an understanding of nutritional requirements will help managers to adopt best practices in their plantations. While many plantations show significant responses to nutrients, particularly phosphorus (P, e.g. up to 200% stem volume increase at age one year); initial large responses to P fertiliser are reported to diminish over time, such that the response tends to be non-significant at many sites by harvest age. Only small quantities are recommended at establishment (equivalent to around 10 kg P ha(-1)) to maximise productivity. Large quantities of site nutrient pools are held in harvesting debris or slash. Slash should be considered a valuable resource for sustaining productivity into the future, and its role in relation to fertiliser application needs further study.

TI  - Agent-based models of malaria transmission: a systematic review
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
AB  - Background: Much of the extensive research regarding transmission of malaria is underpinned by mathematical modelling. Compartmental models, which focus on interactions and transitions between population strata, have been a mainstay of such modelling for more than a century. However, modellers are increasingly adopting agent-based approaches, which model hosts, vectors and/or their interactions on an individual level. One reason for the increasing popularity of such models is their potential to provide enhanced realism by allowing system-level behaviours to emerge as a consequence of accumulated individual-level interactions, as occurs in real populations.
   Methods: A systematic review of 90 articles published between 1998 and May 2018 was performed, characterizing agent-based models (ABMs) relevant to malaria transmission. The review provides an overview of approaches used to date, determines the advantages of these approaches, and proposes ideas for progressing the field.
   Results: The rationale for ABM use over other modelling approaches centres around three points: the need to accurately represent increased stochasticity in low-transmission settings; the benefits of high-resolution spatial simulations; and heterogeneities in drug and vaccine efficacies due to individual patient characteristics. The success of these approaches provides avenues for further exploration of agent-based techniques for modelling malaria transmission. Potential extensions include varying elimination strategies across spatial landscapes, extending the size of spatial models, incorporating human movement dynamics, and developing increasingly comprehensive parameter estimation and optimization techniques.
   Conclusion: Collectively, the literature covers an extensive array of topics, including the full spectrum of transmission and intervention regimes. Bringing these elements together under a common framework may enhance knowledge of, and guide policies towards, malaria elimination. However, because of the diversity of available models, endorsing a standardized approach to ABM implementation may not be possible. Instead it is recommended that model frameworks be contextually appropriate and sufficiently described. One key recommendation is to develop enhanced parameter estimation and optimization techniques. Extensions of current techniques will provide the robust results required to enhance current elimination efforts.

TI  - Evaluation of SVM, ELM and four tree-based ensemble models for predicting daily reference evapotranspiration using limited meteorological data in different climates of China
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
AB  - Accurate estimation of reference evapotranspiration (ET0) is of great importance for the regional water resources planning and irrigation scheduling design. The FAO-56 Penman-Monteith model is recommended as the reference model to predict ET0, but its application is commonly restricted by lack of complete meteorological data at many worldwide locations. This study evaluated the potential of machine learning models, particularly four relatively simple tree-based assemble algorithms (Le. random forest (RF), M5 model tree (M5Tree), gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)), for estimating daily ET0 with limited meteorological data using a K-fold cross-validation method. For assessment of the tree-based models in terms of prediction accuracy, stability and computational costs, these models were further compared with their corresponding support vector machine (SVM) and extreme learning machine (ELM) models. Four input combinations of daily maximum and maximum temperature (T-max and T-min), relative humidity (H-r), wind speed (U-2), global and extra-terrestrial solar radiation (R-s and R-a) with T-max, T-min and R-a as the base dataset were considered using meteorological data during 1961-2010 from eight representative weather stations in different climates of China. The results showed that, when lack of complete meteorological data, the machine learning models using T-max, T-min, H-r, U-2 and R-a obtained satisfactory ET0 estimates in the temperate continental, mountain plateau and temperate monsoon zones of China (RMSE < 0.5 mm d(-1)). However, models with three input parameters of T-max, T-min and R-s were superior for daily ET0 prediction in the tropical and subtropical zones. The ELM and SVM models offered the best combination of prediction accuracy and stability. The simple tree-based XGBoost and GBDT models showed comparable accuracy and stability to the SVM and ELM models, but exhibited much less computational costs. Considering the complexity level, prediction accuracy, stability and computational costs of the studied models, the XGBoost and GBDT models have been recommended for daily ET0 estimation in different climatic zones of China and maybe elsewhere with similar climates around the world.

TI  - Visceral Leishmaniasis and Land Use and Cover in the Carajas Integration Region, Eastern Amazon, Brazil
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE
AB  - Human visceral leishmaniasis is a major public health problem in the Amazon. Thus, we analyzed the spatial distribution of this disease and its relationship with epidemiological, socioeconomic, and environmental variables in the Carajas Integration Region, Para state, from 2011 to 2020. Epidemiological data for this ecological study were obtained from the State Public Health Secretariat, environmental data were obtained from the National Space Research Institute, and socioeconomic data were obtained from the Brazilian Geography and Statistics Institute. ArcGIS 10.5.1 software was used for classifying land use and cover and for the Kernel and Moran spatial analyses. It was observed in 685 confirmed cases that the epidemiological profile followed the national pattern of the disease occurrence, with a high prevalence in children who were not school-aged. The disease had a non-homogeneous distribution with clusters related to different human activities, such as urbanization, ranching, and mining. A spatial dependence between the disease prevalence and socioeconomic indicators was observed. The municipalities presented gradients of case densities associated with a direct relationship between areas with cases and deforestation. The disease is developing due to risk factors such as establishment and maintenance related to the non-sustainable development model implemented in the region, pointing to the need for its revision.

TI  - Epidemiological risk in an endemic area of sleeping sickness in Cote d'Ivoire
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE & INTERNATIONAL HEALTH
AB  - An epidemiological risk indicator based on purely entomological factors can be used to identify regions which are at higher risk of transmission within the endemic forest zones of Ivory Coast, and can serve to po:nt out biotopes to be treated to make antivector campaigns more effective. In the forests of Ivory Coast, so-called socially open environments which are populated by a great number of ethnic groups who are highly mobile and whose camps are spread over a large area, are particularly vulnerable to epidemics of the disease. Transmission always occurs near water: at rivers, water holes, plantations. By contrast, socially closed societies consisting of a single ethnic group settled in a village are at much lower risk. It seems that human behaviour plays as much a role in transmission dynamics as environmental changes which may be more or less favourable to the vector.

TI  - Comparison of Machine Learning Techniques in Inferring Phytoplankton Size Classes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - The size of phytoplankton not only influences its physiology, metabolic rates and marine food web, but also serves as an indicator of phytoplankton functional roles in ecological and biogeochemical processes. Therefore, some algorithms have been developed to infer the synoptic distribution of phytoplankton cell size, denoted as phytoplankton size classes (PSCs), in surface ocean waters, by the means of remotely sensed variables. This study, using the NASA bio-Optical Marine Algorithm Data set (NOMAD) high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) database, and satellite match-ups, aimed to compare the effectiveness of modeling techniques, including partial least square (PLS), artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machine (SVM) and random forests (RF), and feature selection techniques, including genetic algorithm (GA), successive projection algorithm (SPA) and recursive feature elimination based on support vector machine (SVM-RFE), for inferring PSCs from remote sensing data. Results showed that: (1) SVM-RFE worked better in selecting sensitive features; (2) RF performed better than PLS, ANN and SVM in calibrating PSCs retrieval models; (3) machine learning techniques produced better performance than the chlorophyll-a based three-component method; (4) sea surface temperature, wind stress, and spectral curvature derived from the remote sensing reflectance at 490, 510, and 555 nm were among the most sensitive features to PSCs; and (5) the combination of SVM-RFE feature selection techniques and random forests regression was recommended for inferring PSCs. This study demonstrated the effectiveness of machine learning techniques in selecting sensitive features and calibrating models for PSCs estimations with remote sensing.

TI  - Gene Flow, Subspecies Composition, and Dengue Virus-2 Susceptibility among <i>Aedes aegypti</i> Collections in Senegal
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background: Aedes aegypti, the "yellow fever mosquito'', is the primary vector to humans of the four serotypes of dengue viruses (DENV1-4) and yellow fever virus (YFV) and is a known vector of Chikungunya virus. There are two recognized subspecies of Ae. aegypti sensu latu (s.l.): the presumed ancestral form, Ae. aegypti formosus (Aaf), a primarily sylvan mosquito in sub-Saharan Africa, and Ae. aegypti aegypti (Aaf), found globally in tropical and subtropical regions typically in association with humans. The designation of Ae. aegypti s.l. subspecies arose from observations made in East Africa in the late 1950s that the frequency of pale "forms'' of Ae. aegypti was higher in populations in and around human dwellings than in those of the nearby bush. But few studies have been made of Ae. aegypti s.l. in West Africa. To address this deficiency we have been studying the population genetics, subspecies composition and vector competence for DENV-2 of Ae. aegypti s.l. in Senegal.
   Methods and Findings: A population genetic analysis of gene flow was conducted among 1,040 Aedes aegypti s.l. from 19 collections distributed across the five phytogeographic regions of Senegal. Adults lacking pale scales on their first abdominal tergite were classified as Aedes aegypti formosus (Aaf) following the original description of the subspecies and the remainder were classified as Aedes aegypti aegypti (Aaa). There was a clear northwest-southeast cline in the abundance of Aaa and Aaf. Collections from the northern Sahelian region contained only Aaa while southern Forest gallery collections contained only Aaf. The two subspecies occurred in sympatry in four collections north of the Gambia in the central Savannah region and Aaa was a minor component of two collections from the Forest gallery area. Mosquitoes from 11 collections were orally challenged with DENV-2 virus. In agreement with the early literature, Aaf had significantly lower vector competence than Aaa. Among pure Aaa collections, the disseminated infection rate (DIR) was 73.9% with a midgut infection barrier (MIB) rate of 6.8%, and a midgut escape barrier (MEB) rate of 19.3%, while among pure Aaf collections, DIR = 34.2%, MIB rate = 7.4%, and MEB rate = 58.4%. Allele and genotype frequencies were analyzed at 11 nuclear single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci using allele specific PCR and melting curve analysis. In agreement with a published isozyme gene flow study in Senegal, only a small and statistically insignificant percentage of the variance in allele frequencies was associated with subspecies.
   Conclusions: These results add to our understanding of the global phylogeny of Aedes aegypti s.l., suggesting that West African Aaa and Aaf are monophyletic and that Aaa evolved in West Africa from an Aaf ancestor.

TI  - The biology of xylem fluid-feeding insect vectors of <i>Xylella fastidiosa</i> and their relation to disease epidemiology
T2  - ANNUAL REVIEW OF ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - Xylophagous leafhopppers are common and abundant insects of tropical and subtropical environments and play important ecological roles in these ecosystems. The feeding biology of these insects is unique in terms of their high feeding rates and a digestive physiology that allows them to assimilate amino acids, organic acids, and sugars at approximately 99% efficiency. For those species well studied, fluctuations in plant xylem chemistry and tension appear to determine the diurnal and seasonal use of their host plants. Relatively few species of xylem fluid-feeding leafhoppers are considered important pests in commercial agriculture, as they transmit the bacterial plant pathogen Xylella fastidiosa. X.fastidiosa induces diseases of grapevines, citrus, coffee, almond, alfalfa, stone fruits, landscape ornamentals, and native hardwoods for which there is no cure. Two Xylella diseases, citrus variegated chlorosis (CVC) and Pierce's disease (PD) of grapevines, have emerged as important issues within the past decade. In Brazil, CVC became important in the early 1990s and has now expanded throughout many citrus-growing areas of South America and threatens to spread to North America. The recent establishment of the exotic glassy-winged sharpshooter (Homalodisca coagulata) in California now threatens much of the United States' wine grape, table grape, and almond production. The spread of H. coagulata throughout southern California and the spread of CVC northward from Argentina through Brazil exemplifies the biological risks from exotic species. The occurrence and epidemiology of leafhopper-vectored Xylella diseases are discussed.

TI  - Teak (<i>Tectona grandis</i> L.) tree growth, stem quality and health in coppiced plantations in Java, Indonesia
T2  - NEW FORESTS
AB  - Coppicing is an alternative reforestation tool for teak in the tropics, substantially reducing regeneration time/costs and associated demands for labor and seed when available. Growth rates of coppiced material are rapid in most situations, but stem/wood quality is a frequent concern. We compared coppiced teak plantations to paired seed-origin plantations, at ages 3, 8, and 13 years, on Forest State Corporation managed land located in Java, Indonesia. Teak trees were evaluated for height, diameter, lower-bole straightness, and presence of disease in both plantation types and at three ages. Mean height and diameter of trees in coppiced plantations were both significantly greater than that in their paired seed-origin plantations at all three ages. Furthermore, heights and diameters in coppiced plantations were higher than expected based on established growth tables for Java. Coppiced plantations were less symptomatic of disease than seed-origin plantations, which promises better wood production and quality. Lower-bole stems in coppiced plantations developed less straight than those in seed-origin plantations, but these deviations faded with time and will likely become insignificant within a 60-year rotation. Based on these results from existing coppiced plantations in Java, coppiced plantations can make a major contribution to teak production in Indonesia.

TI  - Cytokine Networks Dysregulation during HTLV-1 Infection and Associated Diseases
T2  - VIRUSES-BASEL
AB  - Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is the causative agent of a neural chronic inflammation, called HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) and of a malignant lymphoproliferation, called the adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL). The mechanisms through which the HTLV-1 induces these diseases are still unclear, but they might rely on immune alterations. HAM/TSP is associated with an impaired production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as IFN-, TNF-, CXCL9, or CXCL10. ATLL is associated with high levels of IL-10 and TGF-. These immunosuppressive cytokines could promote a protumoral micro-environment. Moreover, HTLV-1 infection impairs the IFN-I production and signaling, and favors the IL-2, IL-4, and IL-6 expression. This contributes both to immune escape and to infected cells proliferation. Here, we review the landscape of cytokine dysregulations induced by HTLV-1 infection and the role of these cytokines in the HTLV-1-associated diseases progression.

TI  - Seed dispersal by ungulates in the point calimere wildlife sanctuary: A scientific and perspective analysis
T2  - SAUDI JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB  - Exotic woody weed plants are a very serious threat to seed dispersed by ungulate in the tropical forest of Asia. The ungulates in Point Calimere Wildlife Sanctuary (PCWS) are a significant role in native indigenous seed dispersal. The exotic woody weed tree Prosopis juliflora prevalence distributed in the PCWS and they might potentially alter the native medicinal plant species. In the present investigation, we have assessed the seed dispersal by ungulates in PCWS from January to March 2017. Four different ungulate species were selected to understand their seed dispersal rate of different plant species in selected sanctuary. This investigation was planned to confirm the seed dispersal by ungulates of blackbuck, spotted deer, wild boar and feral horse. Among the four different ungulates tested, the maximum numbers of pellets collected from blackbuck and no seed found in their pellets. The low quantities of pellets were collected from wild boar and this study has recorded medium-sized ungulates which dispersed variety of plant. However, the dispersal of the seed of medicinal plants were not considerably high and relatively moderate percentage of seeds dispersal occurred in medium-sized ungulates like wild boar and spotted deer. P. juliflora had 100% seed germination rate were observed from the faecal samples of wild boar and feral horse. The control seed achieved maximum seedling rate than the ungulates seeds.

TI  - Mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) From the Southwestern Brazilian Amazon: Liberdade and Gregorio Rivers
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - The mosquito community from remote locations toward the southern border of the Brazilian State of Amazonas, in four localities along the Liberdade and Gregorio Rivers, was sampled using CDC and Malaise traps, complemented with net sweeping and immature collections. During May 2011, 190 collections yielded 13,012 mosquitoes, from 15 genera and 112 different species, together with 10 morphospecies, which may represent new undescribed taxa. Among the species collected, there are two new geographical distribution records for the State of Amazonas. Culex, the most abundant genus, also had the highest number of species. Both Aedes and Uranotaenia had the second highest number of species, although they were the second and seventh most abundant, respectively. The most abundant species were Aedes (Ochlerotatus) fulvus (Wiedemann), Aedes (Ochlerotatus) nubilus (Theobald), Culex (Culex) mollis Dyar & Knab, Nyssorhynchus (Nyssorhynchus) oswaldoi sensu lato, Culex (Melanoconion) pedroi Sirivanakarn & Belkin, and Culex (Melanoconion) gnomatos Sallum, Hutchings & Ferreira. The epidemiological implications of mosquito species are discussed and compared with other mosquito inventories from the Amazon region. These results represent the first standardized mosquito inventories of the Liberdade and Gregorio Rivers, with the identification of 112 species and 10 morphospecies, within the municipalities of Ipixuna and Eirunepe, from which we have only few records in the published literature.

TI  - Risk Factors for Scrub Typhus, Murine Typhus, and Spotted Fever Seropositivity in Urban Areas, Rural Plains, and Peri-Forest Hill Villages in South India: A Cross-Sectional Study
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Scrub typhus and spotted fever group rickettsioses are thought to be common causes of febrile illness in India, whereas they rarely test for murine typhus. This cross-sectional study explored the risk factors associated with scrub typhus, tick-borne spotted fever, and murine typhus seropositivity in three different geographical settings, urban, rural, and hill villages in Tamil Nadu, South India. We enrolled 1,353 participants living in 48 clusters. The study included a questionnaire survey and blood sampling. Blood was tested for Orientia tsutsugamushi (scrub typhus), Rickettsia typhi (murine typhus), and spotted fever group Rickettsia IgG using ELISA. The seroprevalence of scrub typhus, spotted fever, and murine typhus were 20.4%, 10.4%, and 5.4%, respectively. Scrub typhus had the highest prevalence in rural areas (28.1%), and spotted fever was most common in peri-forested areas (14.9%). Murine typhus was more common in rural (8.7%) than urban areas (5.4%) and absent in peri-forested hill areas. Agricultural workers had a higher relative risk for scrub typhus, especially in urban areas. For murine typhus, proximity to a waterbody and owning a dog were found to be major risk factors. The main risk factors for spotted fever were agricultural work and living in proximity to a forest. Urban, rural plains, and hill settings display distinct epidemiological pattern of Orientia and rickettsial infections. Although scrub typhus and spotted fever were associated with known risk factors in this study, the findings suggest a different ecology of murine typhus transmission compared with other studies conducted in Asia.

TI  - Confronting the Emerging Threat to Public Health in Northern Australia of Neglected Indigenous Arboviruses
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE
AB  - In excess of 75 arboviruses have been identified in Australia, some of which are now well established as causative agents of debilitating diseases. These include Ross River virus, Barmah Forest virus, and Murray Valley encephalitis virus, each of which may be detected by both antibody-based recognition and molecular typing. However, for most of the remaining arboviruses that may be associated with pathology in humans, routine tests are not available to diagnose infection. A number of these so-called 'neglected' or 'orphan' arboviruses that are indigenous to Australia might have been infecting humans at a regular rate for decades. Some of them may be associated with undifferentiated febrile illness-fever, the cause of which is not obvious-for which around half of all cases each year remain undiagnosed. This is of particular relevance to Northern Australia, given the Commonwealth Government's transformative vision for the midterm future of massive infrastructure investment in this region. An expansion of the industrial and business development of this previously underpopulated region is predicted. This is set to bring into intimate proximity infection-naive human hosts, native reservoir animals, and vector mosquitoes, thereby creating a perfect storm for increased prevalence of infection with neglected Australian arboviruses. Moreover, the escalating rate and effects of climate change that are increasingly observed in the tropical north of the country are likely to lead to elevated numbers of arbovirus-transmitting mosquitoes. As a commensurate response, continuing assiduous attention to vector monitoring and control is required. In this overall context, improved epidemiological surveillance and diagnostic screening, including establishing novel, rapid pan-viral tests to facilitate early diagnosis and appropriate treatment of febrile primary care patients, should be considered a public health priority. Investment in a rigorous identification program would reduce the possibility of significant outbreaks of these indigenous arboviruses at a time when population growth accelerates in Northern Australia.

AB  - Methane flux (FCH4) measurements using the eddy covariance technique have increased over the past decade. FCH4 measurements commonly include data gaps, as is the case with CO2 and energy fluxes. However, gap-filling FCH4 data are more challenging than other fluxes due to its unique characteristics including multidriver dependency, variabilities across multiple timescales, nonstationarity, spatial heterogeneity of flux footprints, and lagged influence of biophysical drivers. Some researchers have applied a marginal distribution sampling (MDS) algorithm, a standard gap-filling method for other fluxes, to FCH4 datasets, and others have applied artificial neural networks (ANN) to resolve the challenging characteristics of FCH4. However, there is still no consensus regarding FCH4 gap-filling methods due to limited comparative research. We are not aware of the applications of machine learning (ML) algorithms beyond ANN to FCH4 datasets. Here, we compare the performance of MDS and three ML algorithms (ANN, random forest [RF], and support vector machine [SVM]) using multiple combinations of ancillary variables. In addition, we applied principal component analysis (PCA) as an input to the algorithms to address multidriver dependency of FCH4 and reduce the internal complexity of the algorithmic structures. We applied this approach to five benchmark FCH4 datasets from both natural and managed systems located in temperate and tropical wetlands and rice paddies. Results indicate that PCA improved the performance of MDS compared to traditional inputs. ML algorithms performed better when using all available biophysical variables compared to using PCA-derived inputs. Overall, RF was found to outperform other techniques for all sites. We found gap-filling uncertainty is much larger than measurement uncertainty in accumulated CH4 budget. Therefore, the approach used for FCH4 gap filling can have important implications for characterizing annual ecosystem-scale methane budgets, the accuracy of which is important for evaluating natural and managed systems and their interactions with global change processes.

TI  - Aedes Mosquito Infestation in Socioeconomically Contrasting Neighborhoods of Panama City
T2  - ECOHEALTH
AB  - The global expansion and proliferation of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus represents a growing public health threat due to their capacity to transmit a variety of arboviruses to humans, including dengue, chikungunya, and Zika. Particularly important in urban regions, where these species have evolved to breed in man-made containers and feed nearly exclusively on human hosts, the threat of vector-borne disease has risen in recent decades due to the growth of cities, progression of climate change, and increase in globalization. While the dynamics of Aedes populations in urban settings have been well studied in relation to ecological features of the landscape, relatively less is known about the relationship between neighborhood socioeconomic status and Aedes infestation. Here, we compare infestation levels of both A. aegypti and A. albopictus in four socioeconomically contrasting neighborhoods of urban Panama City, Panama. Our results indicate that infestation levels for both Aedes species vary between neighborhoods of contrasting socioeconomic status, being higher in neighborhoods having lower percentage of residents with bachelor degrees and lower monthly household income. Additionally, we find that proximity between socioeconomically contrasting neighborhoods can predict infestation levels by species, with A. aegypti increasing and A. albopictus decreasing with proximity between neighborhoods. These findings hold key implications for the control and prevention of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika in Panama, a region with ongoing arbovirus outbreaks and high economic inequity.

TI  - Stable and Local Reservoirs of <i>Mycobacterium ulcerans</i> Inferred from the Nonrandom Distribution of Bacterial Genotypes, Benin
T2  - EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB  - Mycobacterium ulcerans is the causative agent of Buruli ulcer, a neglected tropical disease found in rural areas of West and Central Africa. Despite the ongoing efforts to tackle Buruli ulcer epidemics, the environmental reservoir of its pathogen remains elusive, underscoring the need for new approaches to improving disease prevention and management. In our study, we implemented a local-scale spatial clustering model and deciphered the genetic diversity of the bacteria in a small area of Benin where Buruli ulcer is endemic. Using 179 strain samples from West Africa, we conducted a phylogeographic analysis combining whole-genome sequencing with spatial scan statistics. The 8 distinct genotypes we identified were by no means randomly spread over the studied area. Instead, they were divided into 3 different geographic clusters, associated with landscape characteristics. Our results highlight the ability of M. ulcerans to evolve independently and differentially depending on location in a specific ecologic reservoir.

TI  - Arable Weeds at the Edges of Kettle Holes as Overwintering Habitat for Phytopathogenic Fungi
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
AB  - Weeds in agricultural landscapes can serve as alternate hosts for phytopathogenic fungi and promote the spatial and long-term distribution of these fungi. Especially, semi-natural habitats such as kettle holes are considered as a source of fungal pathogens because they are a permanent habitat for various weed species in arable lands. In our study, we investigated the suitability of nine different weed species and families at the edges of 18 kettle holes in two consecutive autumn/winter seasons as alternate hosts for Fusarium and Alternaria. We detected a fungal infestation with both genera on every weed species investigated with significantly higher abundances of these fungi in the second, notably wetter season. Eight weed species were described as non-host plants for Fusarium and Alternaria in agricultural landscapes in Brandenburg, Germany for the first time. In both autumn/winter periods, weeds harbored more Alternaria than Fusarium. The study revealed a high Fusarium species diversity in weeds and a community structure of up to 12 Fusarium species at the edges of kettle holes. Grasses showed the highest diversity and often the highest fungal abundances compared to herbaceous plants. Therefore, these habitats in arable lands can act as ecosystem disservice and promote the spread of fungal diseases in the surrounding crop fields.

TI  - SPATIAL PATTERN-ANALYSIS OF WITCHES-BROOM DISEASE OF CACAO AT A LANDSCAPE SCALE IN RONDONIA, BRAZIL
T2  - TROPICAL AGRICULTURE
AB  - Approximately 60 000 ha of cacao [Theobroma cacao (L.)] are planted in the state of Rondonia, Brazil. The losses in this important cash crop due to witches' broom [Crinipellis perniciosa (Stahel) Singer], an endemic fungal disease, are estimated at U.S. $12 million annually. A thorough understanding of witches' broom epidemiology is essential for the development of more effective disease control procedures and higher cacao yields. The spatial pattern of witches' broom was examined at a scale intermediate to the field and regional scales (landscape scale) to evaluate spatial interaction between fields for a municipality in Rondonia. The spatial pattern of disease intensity levels between fields was evaluated using join count statistics, in combination with a distance-based measure of local spatial autocorrelation, G(i)(d). Most of the municipality exhibited no positive spatial autocorrelation, indicating that plantations exhibiting the highest disease intensity levels were not clustered. The random nature of the spatial pattern was hypothesized to be the result of a combination of the architecture of the individual lots, disease control (phytosanitary pruning), and the separation of plantations by distances greater than can be traversed by viable inocula.

TI  - Phlebotominae (Diptera: Psycodidae) fauna in the Chaco region and Cutaneous Leishmaniasis transmission patterns in Argentina
T2  - MEMORIAS DO INSTITUTO OSWALDO CRUZ
AB  - Argentina, the incidence of American Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (ACL) has shown a steady increase over the last few decades. In the Chaco biogeographical region, specifically, several outbreaks of ACL were recently reported in addition to the usual time-space scattering of ACL cases. However, little is known about the sandfly composition in the eastern, humid Chaco (HC) region or the western, dry Chaco (DC) region. Therefore, phlebotomine captures were performed throughout this region and an analysis of the distribution of reported ACL cases was conducted in order to assess the vector diversity in ACL endemic and epidemic scenarios in the Chaco region. The results support the hypothesis of two distinct patterns: (1) the DC, where Lutzomyia migonei was the most prevalent species, had isolated ACL cases and a zoonotic cycle; (2) the HC, where Lutzomyia neivai was the most prevalent species, had an increase in ACL incidence and outbreaks and an anthropozoonotic cycle. The epidemic risk in the Chaco region may be associated with the current climate trends, landscape modification, connection with other ACL foci, and Lu. neivai predominance and abundance. Therefore, changes in sandfly population diversity and density in the Chaco region are an indicator of emergent epidemic risk in sentinel capture sites.

TI  - Prevalence of blood and skin trypanosomes in domestic and wild fauna from two sleeping sickness foci in Southern Cameroon
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Although studies on African Trypanosomiases revealed a variety of trypanosome species in the blood of various animal taxa, animal reservoirs of Trypanosoma brucei gambiense and anatomical niches such as skin have been overlooked in most epidemiological settings. This study aims to update epidemiological data on trypanosome infections in animals from human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) foci of Cameroon. Blood and skin snips were collected from 291 domestic and wild animals. DNA was extracted from blood and skin snips and molecular approaches were used to identify different trypanosomes species. Immunohistochemical analyses were used to confirm trypanosome infections in skin snips. PCR revealed 137 animals (47.1%) with at least one trypanosome species in the blood and/or in the skin. Of these 137 animals, 90 (65.7%) and 32 (23.4%) had trypanosome infections respectively in the blood and skin. Fifteen (10.9%) animals had trypanosome infections in both blood and skin snip. Animals from the Campo HAT focus (55.0%) were significantly (X-2 = 17.6; P < 0.0001) more infected than those (29.7%) from Bipindi. Trypanosomes of the subgenus Trypanozoon were present in 27.8% of animals while T. vivax, T. congolense forest type and savannah type were detected in 16.5%, 10.3% and 1.4% of animals respectively. Trypanosoma b. gambiense infections were detected in the blood of 7.6% (22/291) of animals. No T. b. gambiense infection was detected in skin. This study highlights the presence of several trypanosome species in the blood and skin of various wild and domestic animals. Skin appeared as an anatomical reservoir for trypanosomes in animals. Despite methodological limitations, pigs, sheep, goats and wild animals were confirmed as potential reservoirs of T. b. gambiense. These animal reservoirs must be considered for the designing of control strategies that will lead to sustainable elimination of HAT.
   Author summaryHuman African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) is a neglected tropical disease affecting some sub-Saharan Africa countries. Although HAT elimination can be considered as achieved in some foci, the interruption of its transmission by 2030 remains a challenge. Animal reservoir and skin-dwelling trypanosomes have emerged as factors that can compromise sustainable elimination of HAT. It is in this light that T. b. gambiense infections and different trypanosome species were identified in blood and skin of domestic and wild animals from two HAT foci of the forest region of Cameroon. For this study, blood and skin snip samples were collected from domestic and wild animals. Molecular tools were used to identify different trypanosome species. Several trypanosome species including trypanosomes of the subgenus Trypanozoon, T. vivax and T. congolense were detected in the blood and skin of several animal taxa. Immuno-histochemical tools confirmed trypanosome infections in the skin. Pigs, sheep, goats and wild animals were confirmed as potential animal reservoirs of T. b. gambiense. Results of this study highlighted the necessity of considering animal reservoirs as well as skin-dwelling trypanosomes in the designing of new control strategies that will lead to the interruption of HAT transmission by 2030.

TI  - Growth, yield and system performance simulation of a sugarcane-eucalyptus interface in a sub-tropical region of Brazil
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - The sugarcane (Sacharum officinarum) monocropping has had a great socio-economic and environmental impact in Brazil, and agroforestry (AFs) has been considered as an alternative to its sustainable production. However, there is a lack of field experiments results under such conditions. Therefore, yield measurement across transect in the tree-crop interface in on-farm conditions, as well as the use of simulation models, may allow the evaluation of biophysical interactions between trees and crops and system productivity. In this work, plant growth and yield in a sugarcane-eucalyptus (Eucalyptus grandis) on-farm interface were evaluated. The experimental site had a Chromic Ferralsol soil and it is located in a sub-tropical region of Brazil. Availability of solar radiation for the crop along the transect was estimated and its effect on sugarcane dry matter production was evaluated. Using such relations, two sugarcane-eucalyptus AFs cycles were simulated to estimate system productivity. The field results showed that the trees presented a higher growth in the AFs, while the crop growth and yield were inversely proportional to their distance from the trees. The eucalyptus wood volume increased from 0.15 to 0.29 m(3) per tree from monocropping to AFs. The sugarcane dry matter decreased from 35.1 to 8.70 t ha(-1) from the furthest to the closest position from tree along the transect. Simulations suggested that light was the main cause of the crop yield reduction, but the importance of competition for water and nutrients increased inversely according to tree distance. However, both simulated AFs provided land equivalent ratio (LER) similar to one (1). Field measurements and simulations indicate that agroforestry systems are a sound alternative for sugarcane cultivation in the studied region. Combination of on-farm studies and simulation models provided conditions to understand tree-crop interactions and to extrapolate field results so that the performance of a new system could be estimated.

TI  - Africa's Nomadic Pastoralists and Their Animals Are an Invisible Frontier in Pandemic Surveillance
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - The effects of COVID-19 have gone undocumented in nomadic pastoralist communities across Africa, which are largely invisible to health surveillance systems despite the fact that they are of key significance in the setting of emerging infectious disease. We expose these landscapes as a "blind spot" in global health surveillance, elaborate on the ways in which current health surveillance infrastructure is ill-equipped to capture pastoralist populations and the animals with which they coexist, and highlight the consequential risks of inadequate surveillance among pastoralists and their livestock to global health. As a platform for further dialogue, we present concrete solutions to address this gap.

TI  - Systematic Revision of Sub-Saharan African Dormice (Rodentia: Gliridae: <i>Graphiurus</i>) Part II: Description of a New Species of <i>Graphiurus</i> from the Central Congo Basin, Including Morphological and Ecological Niche Comparisons with <i>G</i>. <i>crassicaudatus</i> and <i>G</i>. <i>lorraineus</i>
T2  - BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY
AB  - A new species of Graphiurus, G. walterverheyeni, is described. It is represented by two young adults, a female (holotype) and male (paratype), obtained from two sites in the central Congo Basin, Democratic Republic of the Congo. The new species is the possible morphological and phylogenetic counterpart of G. crassicaudatus, endemic to West Africa. Although the new species resembles G. crassicaudatus in texture and coloration of pelage, along with certain derived cranial features, G. walterverheyni, n. sp., is separated not only by its much smaller body size as evidenced by the significant contrasts in external, cranial, and dental metrics between the two species, but also by proportional differences.
   The South Central faunal region of equatorial Africa (Grubb, 1978, 1982, 2001; Colyn, 1991; Colyn and Van Rompaey, 1994; Happold, 1996), and the Salonga-Lukenie-Sankuru landscape (Congo Basin Forest Partnership, 2006). identify the biogeographic landscape of G. walterverheyeni, n. sp. Scant habitat information associated with the specimens suggests that this Congo Basin endemic occurs in seasonally flooded tropical lowland forest formations. Two other species of Graphiurus, G. lorraineus and G. surdus, are broadly sympatric with the new species, but neither has been recorded from the two collection localities.
   Determining species diversity of sub-Saharan dormice embraces epidemiological concerns in addition to strictly taxonomic and biogeographic inquiries. The first documented outbreak of human monkeypox outside Africa occurred in the midwestern United States in 2003 and was associated with a shipment of captive mammals (Funisciurus sp., Heliosciurus sp., Cricetomys sp., Atherurus sp., Hybomys sp., and Graphiurus sp.) from Ghana (Guarner et. al., 2004). Following this outbreak, certain species of African dormice occurring in West and Central Africa are currently being scrutinized as possible hosts of monkeypox virus (Orthopoxviridae), which can produce a severe illness in humans resembling smallpox (Hutson et al., 2007; Levine et al., 2007). Understanding the ecology and epidemiology of this virus requires correct identification of mammalian host species so that accurate, relevant geographic and ecological data can be analyzed.

TI  - Mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) From the Northwestern Brazilian Amazon: Araca River
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - The mosquito fauna (Diptera: Culicidae) from two remote localities along the Araca River, within the Municipality of Barcelos, towards the northern border of the Brazilian State of Amazonas, were sampled using CDC, Shannon, Malaise, and Suspended traps, along with net sweeping and immature collections. During June 2010, 111 collections yielded more than 23,500 mosquitoes distributed in 15 genera, representing 119 different species, together with eight morphospecies, which may represent undescribed new taxa. Among the species collected, there is one new distributional record for Brazil and nine new distributional records for the State of Amazonas. With the highest number of species, the genus Culex Linnaeus also had the largest number of individuals followed by Aedes Meigen with the second highest number of species. The most abundant species was Culex (Melanoconion) gnomatos Sallum, Hutchings & Ferreira followed by Culex (Melanoconion) portesi Senevet & Abonnenc, Culex (Culex) mollis Dyar & Knab, Aedes (Ochlerotatus) fulvus (Wiedemann), Culex (Melanoconion) pedroi Sirivanakarn & Belkin, Culex (Melanoconion) crybda Dyar, Aedes (Ochlerotatus) nubilus (Theobald), and Anopheles (Anopheles) peryassui Dyar & Knab. The epidemiological implications of mosquito species found are discussed and are compared with other mosquito inventories from the Amazon region. As the first standardized mosquito inventory of the Araca River, with the identification of 127 species level taxa, the number of mosquito species which have been collected along the northern tributaries of the middle Rio Negro Basin (i.e., Padauari and Araca Rivers) increased significantly.

TI  - Automated Classification of Tropical Plant Species Data Based on Machine Learning Techniques and Leaf Trait Measurements
T2  - COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY (ICCST 2019)
CP  - 6th International Conference on Computational Science and Technology (ICCST)
AB  - The identification of plant species is fundamental for effective study and management of biodiversity. For automated plant species classification, a combination of leaf features like shapes, texture and color are commonly used. However, in herbariums, the samples collected for each species are often limited and during preservation step some of the feature details disappear making automated classification a challenging task. In this study, we aimed at applying machine learning techniques in automating herbarium species identification from leaf traits extracted from images of the families Annonaceae, Euphorbiaceae and Dipterocarpaceae. Furthermore, we investigated the application of Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) in improving classifier performance on the imbalance datasets. Three machine learning techniques namely Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were applied with/without SMOTE. For Annonaceae species, the best accuracy was 56% by LDA after applying SMOTE. For Euphorbiaceae, the best accuracy was 79% by SVM without SMOTE. For inter-species classification between Annonaceae and Euphorbiaceae, the best accuracy of 63% was achieved by LDA without SMOTE. An accuracy of 85% was achieved by LDA for Dip-terocarpaceae species while 91% accuracy was obtained by both RF and SVM for inter-family classification between the two balanced datasets of Annonaceae and Euphorbiaceae. The results of this study show the feasibility of using extracted traits for building accurate species identification models for Family Dipterocarpaceae and Euphorbiaceae, however, the features used did not yield good results for Annonaceae family. Furthermore, there was no significant improvement when SMOTE technique was applied.

TI  - Panama Canal Forum: From the Conquest of Nature to the Construction of New Ecologies
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL HISTORY
AB  - The year 2014 marked the centennial of the opening of the Panama Canal. Its construction is often narrated as a tale of triumph in which the US government conquered tropical nature using modern science and technology: dominating diseased landscapes, unpredictable rivers, and even physical geography itself. In this Forum, we combine environmental history with the histories of science, technology, and empire to complicate that well-known story. The essays that follow explore the new ecologies that emerged around the canal during its construction and the decades that followed. We collectively show how the US Canal Zone, the Republic of Panama, and the borderlands that separated them became ecological contact zones and important sites for imagining, understanding, and managing tropical environments transformed through human activity. Rural and urban residents, health officials, natural scientists, and tourists discursively and materially constructed different environments on the isthmus. Their efforts were facilitated and hindered by the US government's numerous environmental management projects, from flooding artificial lakes and depopulating the Canal Zone to sanitizing cities and creating nature preserves. However, this did not mean that physical and human geographies readily conformed to imperial plans. As the contributing authors show, city dwellers, farmers, mosquitoes, microbes, flowing water, growing forests, and invasive species disrupted and reshaped state projects. Approaching the Panama Canal's history in this way challenges inherited assumptions about the iconic waterway and raises questions about the potential social and environmental consequences of twenty-first-century infrastructure projects.

TI  - New species of <i>Cylindrocladiella</i> from plantation soils in South-East Asia
T2  - MYCOKEYS
AB  - Cylindrocladiella spp. are widely distributed especially in tropical and sub-tropical regions, where they are mainly known as saprobes although some species are plant pathogens. Very little is known about these fungi in South-East Asia. The aim of this study was to identify a collection of Cylindrocladiella isolates from soils collected in forest nurseries and plantations in Vietnam and Malaysia. This was achieved using DNA sequence comparisons and morphological observations. The study revealed two previously described species, Cy. lageniformis and Cy. peruviana as well as five novel taxa, described here as Cy. arbusta sp. nov., Cy. malesiana sp. nov., Cy. obpyriformis sp. nov., Cy. parvispora sp. nov. and Cy. solicola sp. nov. A relatively small collection of isolates from a limited geographic sampling revealed an unexpectedly high level of Cylindrocladiella diversity suggesting that many more species in this genus await discovery in South-East Asia.

TI  - Pneumococcal Colonization and the Nasopharyngeal Microbiota of Children in Botswana
T2  - PEDIATRIC INFECTIOUS DISEASE JOURNAL
AB  - Background: Nasopharyngeal colonization precedes infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. A more detailed understanding of interactions between S. pneumoniae and the nasopharyngeal microbiota of children could inform strategies to prevent pneumococcal infections.
   Methods: We collected nasopharyngeal swabs from children 1 to 23 months of age in Botswana between August 2012 and June 2016. We tested samples for S. pneumoniae and common respiratory viruses using polymerase chain reaction. We sequenced the V3 region of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene and used random forest models to identify clinical variables and bacterial genera that were associated with pneumococcal colonization.
   Results: Mean age of the 170 children included in this study was 8.3 months. Ninety-six (56%) children were colonized with S. pneumoniae. Pneumococcal colonization was associated with older age (P = 0.0001), a lack of electricity in the home (P = 0.02) and household use of wood as a cooking fuel (P = 0.002). Upper respiratory symptoms were more frequent in children with S. pneumoniae colonization (60% vs. 32%; P = 0.001). Adjusting for age, nasopharyngeal microbiota composition differed in colonized and noncolonized children (P = 0.001). S. pneumoniae colonization was associated with a higher relative abundance of Moraxella (P = 0.001) and lower relative abundances of Corynebacterium (P = 0.001) and Staphylococcus (P = 0.03). A decision tree model containing the relative abundances of bacterial genera had 81% sensitivity and 85% specificity for the determination of S. pneumoniae colonization status.
   Conclusions:S. pneumoniae colonization is associated with characteristic alterations of the nasopharyngeal microbiota of children. Prospective studies should determine if nasopharyngeal microbial composition alters the risk of pneumococcal colonization and thus could be modified as a novel pneumonia prevention strategy.

TI  - Effects of Anthropogenic Disturbance on Indri (<i>Indri indri</i>) Health in Madagascar
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY
AB  - Anthropogenic habitat disturbance impairs ecosystem health by fragmenting forested areas, introducing environmental contamination, and reducing the quality of habitat resources. The effect of this disturbance on wildlife health is of particular concern in Madagascar, one of the world's biodiversity hotspots, where anthropogenic pressures on the environment remain high. Despite the conservation importance of threatened lemur populations in Madagascar, few data exist on the effects of anthropogenic disturbance on lemur health. To examine these impacts, indri (Indri indri) populations were evaluated from two forest reserves that differ in their exposure to anthropogenic disturbance. We compared the health status of 36 indri individuals from two sites: one population from a protected, undisturbed area of lowland evergreen humid forest and the other population from a reserve exposed to frequent tourism and forest degradation. Comparison of indri health parameters between sites suggests an impact of anthropogenic disturbance, including significant differences in leukocyte count and differential, 12 serum parameters, 6 trace minerals, and a higher diversity of parasites, with a significant difference in the presence of the louse, Trichophilopterus babakotophilus. These data suggest that indri living in disturbed forests may experience physiological changes and increased susceptibility to parasitism, which may ultimately impair reproductive success and survival.

TI  - Cryptic diversity and ranavirus infection of a critically endangered Neotropical frog before and after population collapse
T2  - ANIMAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Mesoamerican amphibian declines in apparently pristine and protected habitats have been severe, especially at elevations above 500 m sea level and have been linked to emerging diseases and a changing climate. The Craugastor punctariolus species series of direct developing frogs is endemic to the region and used to be comprised of 33 species, seven of which have known populations at present. One of these, C. ranoides, endemic to southern Nicaragua and Costa Rica, was historically found in cloud forest sites of area de Conservacion Guanacaste (ACG) in north-west Costa Rica and extended into dry forest sites 20 km distant. Here, C. ranoides declined and disappeared from high elevation sites between the mid-1980s and early 1990s, but populations persisted in the lowland dry forest. We compared the genetic richness and ranavirus infection status of C. ranoides from extant dry forest populations to historic museum specimens of now extinct ACG cloud forest populations using DNA sequence diversity at two mitochondrial loci and molecular screening for ranavirus. Extant dry forest populations of C. ranoides formed a monophyletic group which included historic specimens sampled at cloud forest sites. However, the extirpated ACG cloud forest population contained additional diversity: samples formed a divergent clade with unknown spatial distribution. Ranavirus was detected in both current and museum samples of C. ranoides and sequences from a 267-nucleotide region of the major capsid protein gene shared 100% sequence identity with one another and with Frog virus 3. Our findings document cryptic diversity within an endangered species that has demonstrated no recovery in cloud forests and raises questions about Ranavirus and its potential link to the amphibian declines in this system. The presence of the same C. ranoides clade within present day and historical samples suggests a potential for effective translocation and repopulation of extirpated cloud forest populations.

TI  - A comparison of selected classification algorithms for mapping bamboo patches in lower Gangetic plains using very high resolution WorldView 2 imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
AB  - Bamboo is used by different communities in India to develop indigenous products, maintain livelihood and sustain life. Indian National Bamboo Mission focuses on evaluation, monitoring and development of bamboo as an important plant resource. Knowledge of spatial distribution of bamboo therefore becomes necessary in this context. The present study attempts to map bamboo patches using very high resolution (VHR) WorldView 2 (WV 2) imagery in parts of South 24 Parganas, West Bengal, India using both pixel and object-based approaches. A combined layer of pan-sharpened multi-spectral (MS) bands, first 3 principal components (PC) of these bands and seven second order texture measures based Gray Level Cooccurrence Matrices (GLCM) of first three PC were used as input variables. For pixel-based image analysis (PBIA), recursive feature elimination (RFE) based feature selection was carried out to identify the most important input variables. Results of the feature selection indicate that the 10 most important variables include PC 1, PC 2 and their GLCM mean along with 6 MS bands. Three different sets of predictor variables (5 and 10 most important variables and all 32 variables) were classified with Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms. Producer accuracy of bamboo was found to be highest when 10 most important variables selected from RFE were classified with SVM (82%). However object-based image analysis (OBIA) achieved higher classification accuracy than PBIA using the same 32 variables, but with less number of training samples. Using object-based SVM classifier, the producer accuracy of bamboo reached 94%. The significance of this study is that the present framework is capable of accurately identifying bamboo patches as well as detecting other tree species in a tropical region with heterogeneous land use land cover (LULC), which could further aid the mandate of National Bamboo Mission and related programs.

TI  - Concordant Phylogeographies of 2 Malaria Vectors Attest to Common Spatial and Demographic Histories
T2  - JOURNAL OF HEREDITY
AB  - The phylogeography of South American lineages is a topic of heated debate. Although a single process is unlikely to describe entire ecosystems, related species, which incur similar habitat limitations, can inform the history for a subsection of assemblages. We compared the phylogeographic patterns of the cytochrome oxidase I marker from Anopheles triannulatus (N = 72) and previous results for A. darlingi (N = 126) in a broad portion of their South American distributions. Both species share similar population subdivisions, with aggregations northeast of the Amazon River, in southern coastal Brazil and 2 regions in central Brazil. The average (ST) between these groups was 0.39 for A. triannulatus. Populations northeast of the Amazon and in southeastern Brazil are generally reciprocally monophyletic to the remaining groups. Based on these initial analyses, we constructed the a priori hypothesis that the Amazon and regions of high declivity pose geographic barriers to dispersal in these taxa. Mantel tests confirmed that these areas block gene flow for more than 1000 km for both species. The efficacy of these impediments was tested using landscape genetics, which could not reject our a priori hypothesis but did reject simpler scenarios. Results form summary statistics and phylogenetics suggest that both lineages originated in central Amazonia (south of the Amazon River) during the late Pleistocene (579 000 years ago) and that they followed the same paths of expansion into their contemporary distributions. These results may have implications for other species sharing similar ecological limitations but probably are not applicable as a general paradigm of Neotropical biogeography.

TI  - A Novel Approach to Match Individual Trees between Aerial Photographs and Airborne LiDAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Integrating multimodal remote sensing data can optimize the mapping accuracy of individual trees. Yet, one issue that is not trivial but generally overlooked in previous studies is the spatial mismatch of individual trees between remote sensing datasets, especially in different imaging modalities. These offset errors between the same tree on different data that have been geometrically corrected can lead to substantial inaccuracies in applications. In this study, we propose a novel approach to match individual trees between aerial photographs and airborne LiDAR data. To achieve this, we first leveraged the maximum overlap of the tree crowns in a local area to determine the correct and the optimal offset vector, and then used the offset vector to rectify the mismatch on individual tree positions. Finally, we compared our proposed approach with a commonly used automatic image registration method. We used pairing rate (the percentage of correctly paired trees) and matching accuracy (the degree of overlap between the correctly paired trees) to measure the effectiveness of results. We evaluated the performance of our approach across six typical landscapes, including broadleaved forest, coniferous forest, mixed forest, roadside trees, garden trees, and parkland trees. Compared to the conventional method, the average pairing rate of individual trees for all six landscapes increased from 91.13% to 100.00% (p = 0.045, t-test), and the average matching accuracy increased from 0.692 & PLUSMN; 0.175 (standard deviation) to 0.861 & PLUSMN; 0.152 (p = 0.017, t-test). Our study demonstrates that the proposed tree-oriented matching approach significantly improves the registration accuracy of individual trees between aerial photographs and airborne LiDAR data.

TI  - <i>Paragonimus</i> and paragonimiasis in West and Central Africa: unresolved questions
T2  - PARASITOLOGY
CP  - British-Society-for-Parasitology (BSP) Autumn Symposium on The Multidisciplinarity of Parasitology - Host-Parasite Evolution in an Ever Changing World
AB  - Paragonimiasis, human lung fluke disease, is a foodborne anthropozoonosis caused by the trematodes assigned to Paragonimus and is regarded by the World Health Organization as a Neglected Tropical Disease (NTD). The life cycle of this medically important parasite centres on a complex freshwater biological community that includes two intermediate hosts: a mollusc and a decapod, usually a brachyuran. Although there is a perception that the biology, symptoms, diagnosis and treatment of Paragonimus is well understood, in reality, this is not the case, especially in Africa. Much remains unknown concerning the life-cycle of the parasite, its transmission, the current epidemiology of the disease, diagnosis and the effectiveness of treatment. Furthermore, cases of paragonimiasis may be misdiagnosed as resistant tuberculosis (TB) because of the similar pulmonary symptoms and no remission after anti TB therapy. The endemic foci of human paragonimiasis in Africa have been reported mainly in the forest zones of Upper Guinea (Liberia, Guinea and Ivory Coast) and Lower Guinea (Nigeria, Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea and Gabon). Despite the perceived medical importance of paragonimiasis, relatively little attention has been paid to this NTD since its discovery in Africa in the 1960s. This review focuses on the current understanding of the life cycle and transmission of Paragonimus in Africa, discusses its diagnosis and public health importance and highlights many outstanding gaps in the knowledge that still exist for this NTD.

TI  - Topography and Land Cover of Watersheds Predicts the Distribution of the Environmental Pathogen <i>Mycobacterium ulcerans</i> in Aquatic Insects
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background: An understanding of the factors driving the distribution of pathogens is useful in preventing disease. Often we achieve this understanding at a local microhabitat scale; however the larger scale processes are often neglected. This can result in misleading inferences about the distribution of the pathogen, inhibiting our ability to manage the disease. One such disease is Buruli ulcer, an emerging neglected tropical disease afflicting many thousands in Africa, caused by the environmental pathogen Mycobacterium ulcerans. Herein, we aim to describe the larger scale landscape process describing the distribution of M. ulcerans.
   Methodology: Following extensive sampling of the community of aquatic macroinvertebrates in Cameroon, we select the 5 dominant insect Orders, and conduct an ecological niche model to describe how the distribution of M. ulcerans positive insects changes according to land cover and topography. We then explore the generalizability of the results by testing them against an independent dataset collected in a second endemic region, French Guiana.
   Principal Findings: We find that the distribution of the bacterium in Cameroon is accurately described by the land cover and topography of the watershed, that there are notable seasonal differences in distribution, and that the Cameroon model does not predict the distribution of M. ulcerans in French Guiana.
   Conclusions/Significance: Future studies of M. ulcerans would benefit from consideration of local structure of the local stream network in future sampling, and further work is needed on the reasons for notable differences in the distribution of this species from one region to another. This work represents a first step in the identification of large-scale environmental drivers of this species, for the purposes of disease risk mapping.

T2  - REVISTA FORESTAL MESOAMERICA KURU-RFMK
AB  - Isla del Coco is 500 km from Costa Rica's continental territory in the Western Pacific. As a National Park in absolute conservation, it has unique conditions for studying vegetation, ecosystem restoration, and the effects of climate change. Sacoglottis holdridgei Cuatrec. (Palo de Hierro) is an endemic tree that has shown a mortality pattern related to pathogens on the Island based on previous phytosanitary research. We performed a foliar nutritional analysis to evaluate the relationship between tree nutrition and observed mortality in the field. We collected leaf samples from the middle crown of the tree of two populations of ten individuals, each of healthy and diseased trees. The leaves were dried and stored before being analyzed in the laboratory. The results did not show differences in nutritional contents between healthy and diseased trees. These similarities in nutritional contents between the two populations studied allow us to hypothesize about the adaptation mechanisms of S. holdridgei to grow in acidic and poor soils of the Island. These adaptations on nutrients use have been observed in other species that live on the mainland.

T2  - WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST
AB  - Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) is a rare disease with a high mortality rate, caused by New World viral species of the genus Hantavirus. The presence of hantaviruses both north and south of Mexico suggests an extended presence through the country Our objective was to conduct serologic tests to detect antibodies against hantaviruses in wild rodents of the tropical deciduous forest in Morelos, Mexico, and to report information about the distribution and prevalence of these viruses. Blood samples from 153 cricetid and heteromyid rodents were tested for immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies. One individual of Liomys irroratus was seropositive for a Hantavirus antigen. Our results suggest that hantaviruses occur in rodents from southern Morelos in central Mexico. Given the possibility of a false positive result, it is important that this finding be validated with further research.

TI  - Uncovering vector, parasite, blood meal and microbiome patterns from mixed-DNA specimens of the Chagas disease vector <i>Triatoma dimidiata</i>
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Chagas disease, considered a neglected disease by the World Health Organization, is caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, and transmitted by >140 triatomine species across the Americas. In Central America, the main vector is Triatoma dimidiata, an opportunistic blood meal feeder inhabiting both domestic and sylvatic ecotopes. Given the diversity of interacting biological agents involved in the epidemiology of Chagas disease, having simultaneous information on the dynamics of the parasite, vector, the gut micro biome of the vector, and the blood meal source would facilitate identifying key biotic factors associated with the risk of T. cruzi transmission. In this study, we developed a RADseq-based analysis pipeline to study mixed-species DNA extracted from T. dimidiata abdomens. To evaluate the efficacy of the method across spatial scales, we used a nested spatial sampling design that spanned from individual villages within Guatemala to major biogeographic regions of Central America. Information from each biotic source was distinguished with bioinformatics tools and used to evaluate the prevalence of T. cruzi infection and predominant Discrete Typing Units (DTUs) in the region, the population genetic structure of T. dimidiata, gut microbial diversity, and the blood meal history. An average of 3.25 million reads per specimen were obtained, with approximately 1% assigned to the parasite, 20% to the vector, 11% to bacteria, and 4% to putative blood meals. Using a total of 6,405 T. cruzi SNPs, we detected nine infected vectors harboring two distinct DTUs: Tcl and a second unidentified strain, possibly TcIV. Vector specimens were sufficiently variable for population genomic analyses, with a total of 25,710 T. dimidiata SNPs across all samples that were sufficient to detect geographic genetic structure at both local and regional scales. We observed a diverse microbiotic community, with significantly higher bacterial species richness in infected T. dimidiata abdomens than those that were not infected. Unifrac analysis suggests a common assemblage of bacteria associated with infection, which co-occurs with the typical gut microbial community derived from the local environment. We identified vertebrate blood meals from five T. dimidiata abdomens, including chicken, dog, duck and human; however, additional detection methods would be necessary to confidently identify blood meal sources from most specimens. Overall, our study shows this method is effective for simultaneously generating genetic data on vectors and their associated parasites, along with ecological information on feeding patterns and microbial interactions that may be followed up with complementary approaches such as PCR-based parasite detection, 18S eukaryotic and 16S bacterial barcoding.

TI  - Altered activity patterns and reduced abundance of native mammals in sites with feral dogs in the high Andes
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Negative impacts of some introduced carnivores like feral cats are well documented, widespread, and significant. Comparatively, the effects of feral dogs (individuals that are not associated with people or human settlements) on native wildlife are poorly known, even though feral dogs occur worldwide. We assessed the density of feral dogs and compared relative abundance, activity patterns and habitat use of 10 species of mammals in areas with and without feral dogs in Cayambe-Coca National Park in the northern Ecuadorian Andes using line transect surveys, camera traps, and track and sign surveys. In areas where feral dogs were present, four native mammals were absent: mountain coati (Nasuella olivacea), mountain paca (Cuniculus taczanowskii), long-tailed weasel (Mustela frenata), and northern pudu (Pudu mephistophiles). Relative abundances of six species were lower compared to areas without feral dogs: puma (Puma concolor), Andean fox (Lycalopex culpaeus), Andean bear (Tremarctos ornatus), striped hog-nosed skunk (Conepatus semistriatus), mountain tapir (Tapirus pinchaque), and little red brocket deer (Mazama rufina). Three species significantly altered activity patterns where feral dogs were present (Andean bear, mountain tapir, and little red brocket deer). In contrast, none of the native mammal species exhibited shifts in habitat use in areas with feral dogs. Dogs used all habitat types according to availability. Our results point to feral dogs as a significant problem for the native mammal community of this Andean region, and highlight the need to consider feral dogs as a potential threat to wildlife in other regions where anthropogenic effects appear to be low but feral dogs are present, particularly natural areas that contain endangered and endemic species.

TI  - Extreme Heterogeneity in Parasitism Despite Low Population Genetic Structure among Monarch Butterflies Inhabiting the Hawaiian Islands
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Host movement and spatial structure can strongly influence the ecology and evolution of infectious diseases, with limited host movement potentially leading to high spatial heterogeneity in infection. Monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) are best known for undertaking a spectacular long-distance migration in eastern North America; however, they also form non-migratory populations that breed year-round in milder climates such as Hawaii and other tropical locations. Prior work showed an inverse relationship between monarch migratory propensity and the prevalence of the protozoan parasite, Ophryocystis elektroscirrha. Here, we sampled monarchs from replicate sites within each of four Hawaiian Islands to ask whether these populations show consistently high prevalence of the protozoan parasite as seen for monarchs from several other non-migratory populations. Counter to our predictions, we observed striking spatial heterogeneity in parasite prevalence, with infection rates per site ranging from 4-85%. We next used microsatellite markers to ask whether the observed variation in infection might be explained by limited host movement and spatial sub-structuring among sites. Our results showed that monarchs across the Hawaiian Islands form one admixed population, supporting high gene flow among sites. Moreover, measures of individual-level genetic diversity did not predict host infection status, as might be expected if more inbred hosts harbored higher parasite loads. These results suggest that other factors such as landscape-level environmental variation or colonization-extinction processes might instead cause the extreme heterogeneity in monarch butterfly infection observed here.

TI  - Unraveling an emerging disease associated with disturbed aquatic environments: the case of Buruli ulcer
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Buruli ulcer (Mycobacterium ulcerans infection) is an emerging disease of developing tropical and subtropical countries. This environmental mycobacterium causes severe morbidity in communities associated with rivers and standing water bodies (particularly those created as a result of human environmental disturbance such as deforestation and agriculture) and subsequent water quality changes. Neither the reservoir nor the mode of transmission is known, but data from laboratory studies suggest that biting aquatic insects may be involved. M ulcerans has been shown to colonize and grow within specific water bugs (Naucoridae), which then transmit M ulcerans to mice through their bites. PCR evidence suggests that the mycobacterium is present in water, biofilms of aquatic plants, detritus, invertebrates, and fish; however, systematic ecological studies that would provide a more comprehensive understanding of M ulcerans distribution in the environment have been lacking. Several hypotheses are explored in relation to human impacts on aquatic food webs and M ulcerans ecology.

TI  - The Impact of COVID-19 on the Profile of Hospital-Acquired Infections in Adult Intensive Care Units
T2  - ANTIBIOTICS-BASEL
AB  - Hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) are a global public health concern. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, its contribution to mortality and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) grows, particularly in intensive care units (ICUs). A two-year retrospective study from April 2019-April 2021 was conducted in an adult ICU at the Hospital for Infectious and Tropical Diseases, Belgrade, Serbia to assess causative agents of HAIs and AMR rates, with the COVID-19 pandemic ensuing halfway through the study. Resistance rates > 80% were observed for the majority of tested antimicrobials. In COVID-19 patients, Acinetobacter spp. was the dominant cause of HAIs and more frequently isolated than in non-COVID-19 patients. (67 vs. 18, p = 0.001). Also, resistance was higher for imipenem (56.8% vs. 24.5%, p < 0.001), meropenem (61.1% vs. 24.3%, p < 0.001) and ciprofloxacin (59.5% vs. 36.9%, p = 0.04). AMR rates were aggregated with findings from our previous study to identify resistance trends and establish empiric treatment recommendations. The increased presence of Acinetobacter spp. and a positive trend in Klebsiella spp. resistance to fluoroquinolones (R-2 = 0.980, p = 0.01) and carbapenems (R-2 = 0.963, p = 0.02) could have contributed to alarming resistance rates across bloodstream infections (BSIs), pneumonia (PN), and urinary tract infections (UTIs). Exceptions were vancomycin (16.0%) and linezolid (2.6%) in BSIs; tigecycline (14.3%) and colistin (0%) in PNs; and colistin (12.0%) and linezolid (0%) in UTIs. COVID-19 has changed the landscape of HAIs in our ICUs. Approval of new drugs and rigorous surveillance is urgently needed.

TI  - The emerging of the fifth malaria parasite (<i>Plasmodium knowlesi</i>). A public health concern?
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB  - After examining the most recent scientific evidences, which assessed the role of some malaria plasmodia that have monkeys as natural reservoirs, the authors focus their attention on Plasmodium knowlesi. The infective foci attributable to this last Plasmodium species have been identified during the last decade in Malaysia, in particular in the states of Sarawak and Sabah (Malaysian Borneo), and in the Pahang region (peninsular Malaysia). The significant relevance of molecular biology assays (polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, performed with specific primers for P. knowlesi), is underlined, since the traditional microscopic examination does not offer distinguishing features, especially when the differential diagnosis with Plasmodium malariae is of concern. Furthermore, Plasmodium knowlesi disease may be responsible of fatal cases, since its clinical presentation and course is more severe compared with those caused by P. malariae, paralleling a more elevated parasitemia. The most effective mosquito vector is represented by Anopheles latens; this mosquito is a parasite of both humans and monkeys. Among primates, the natural hosts are Macaca fascicularis, M. nemestina, M. inus, and Saimiri scirea. When remarking the possible severe evolution of P. knowlesi malaria, we underline the importance of an early recognition and a timely management, especially in patients who have their first onset in Western Hospitals, after journeys in Southeast Asian countries, and eventually participated in trekking excursions in the tropical forest. When malaria-like signs and symptoms are present, a timely diagnosis and treatment become crucial. In the light of its emerging epidemiological features, P. knowlesi may be added to the reknown human malaria parasites, whith includes P. vivax, P. ovale, P. malariae, and P. falciparum, as the fifth potential ethiologic agent of human malaria. Over the next few years, it will be mandatory to support an adequate surveillance and epidemiological network. In parallel with epidemiological and health care policy studies, also an accurate appraisal of the clinical features of P. knowlesi-affected patients will be strongly needed, since some preliminary experiences seem to show an increased disease severity, associated with increased parasitemia, in parallel with the progressive increase of inter-human infectious passages of this emerging Plasmodium.

TI  - Host relationships of fusiform rust disease .1. Infection and pycnial production on slash pine and nearby tropical relatives
T2  - SILVAE GENETICA
AB  - Seedlings from 8 sources of slash pine (Pinus elliottii var. elliottii and var. densa) and from 2 sources each of Caribbean pine (P. caribaea var. caribaea) and West Indian pine (P. occidentalis) were inoculated using inocula obtained from 2 sources of Cronartium quercuum f. sp. fusiforme, the causal agent of fusiform rust disease. The percentage of infection, evident primarily as galls and sporulation of pycnia of C. q. fusiforme, differed significantly within sources of slash pine and among species. The percentage of infection of all inoculated shoots was highest on slash pine (P. e. densa) seedlings from south Florida (92%) and lowest on P. occidentalis (30%). Among slash pine seedlings, the general trend was more pycnia sporulation on seedlings from sources nearest the origins of inocula, with the only exception being on those of P. e. densa from the most southern source, which showed abundant sporulation of pycnia similar to seedlings P. c. caribaea from a nearby source. No sporulation occurred on seedlings of P. occidentalis. Differences among families within sources of slash pine were significant for percentages of infection and sporulation of pycnia on all shoots inoculated using C. q. fusiforme. Because sporulation of pycnia is a prerequisite for fecundity in C. q. fusiforme, the results suggest strong selection on natural inoculum for infection and fertility among and within sources of slash pine. Breeding strategies currently recognize families of slash pine that minimize damage due to fusiform rust disease, but new strategies might consider limiting pathogen reproduction.

TI  - The role of visual cues in directed aerial descent of <i>Cephalotes atratus</i> workers (Hymenoptera: Formicidae)
T2  - JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY
AB  - Animals often depend on properties of reflected light (e. g. color, brightness) to locate resources. We compared reflectance properties of tree trunks with surrounding vegetation, and examined how differences in reflectance profiles of surrogate tree trunks (red, yellow, green, blue, black, gray, dark gray and white sheets) affected the directed aerial descent of worker Cephalotes atratus (L.) ants. Across the visual spectrum, tree trunk reflectance was 2-10 times higher than the surrounding foliage and differed among trees. In two separate experiments, one with colored sheets and one with black, white and gray sheets, nearly half (42% and 47%, respectively) of falling ants directed their descent to a bright white sheet when given a choice of target colors or shades of gray. When colored and gray sheets were presented individually, landing frequencies were lower than expected for all except white sheets. Glide performance was highly variable, but there was a tendency for higher glide indices to be associated with the white sheet relative to the green sheet. We conclude that visually mediated aerial behavior in falling canopy ants is strongly influenced by reflectance properties of the target object, specifically brightness, and correlates with preferred natural targets of tree trunks.

TI  - Atypical Cutaneous Leishmaniasis Variant
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
AB  - Leishmaniasis is a complex group of parasitic infectious diseases caused by intracellular protozoa of the genus Leishmania. It is a zoonosis mainly transmitted by the bite of infected female Phlebotomus or Lutzomyia sandflies. Clinical manifestations of leishmaniasis are diverse and can range from asymptomatic presentations to disseminated systemic disease. Cutaneous leishmaniasis is endemic in more than 80 countries in the world, having a predominance in tropical and subtropical regions. Although the majority of cases follow a classic development, an increasing number of new and rare variants of cutaneous leishmaniasis have been reported. These variants should be suspected as a cause of diverse clinical presentations, especially in endemic regions and travelers, being a diagnostic challenge for physicians.
   We present a case of atypical cutaneous leishmaniasis found as a single verrucous plaque of eight months of evolution in the left posterior thigh of a 35-year-old man, who presented mild pruritus. The patient reported shrimp farming as his main occupational activity and was living in a rural region surrounded by forest on the Pacific coast of Ecuador. On dermatological examination, a single 4 x 5 cm verrucous plaque with irregular borders and a scaly erythematous violaceous aspect was found. Histopathological analysis revealed the presence of lymphohistiocytic inflammatory infiltrate with plasmocytes and granulomatous inflammation. On the Giemsa stain, intracellular amastigotes (Leishman-Donovan bodies) were observed. The treatment consisted of intramuscular meglumine antimoniate, presenting significant improvement on follow-up.

TI  - Epidemiological aspects of American cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL) in an endemic area of forest extractivist culture in western Brazilian Amazonia
T2  - REVISTA DO INSTITUTO DE MEDICINA TROPICAL DE SAO PAULO
AB  - The study sought to analyze clinical and epidemiological aspects of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) in Xapuri, Acre, Brazil. Data from 2008 to 2014 registered in the notification records of the disease of the Information System of the Complaints of Notification (SINAN), and the data of the Information Department of the Unified Health System (DATASUS) available from 2007 to 2013 were used and analyzed in the light of the statistics of the temporal series by the Prais-Winsten method and chi-squared test. A total of 906 cases were registered with 60.2% occurring in men and 39.7% in women. The groups from 0 to 4 years of age (48.0%) and from 5 to 19 years of age (23.3%) were the most affected. Regarding the clinical forms, 77.7% presented CL and 22.3% mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (MCL). Among the 896 cases with information on the diagnostic methods used, Montenegro's skin test predominated (66.4%), with a positive result of 95.8% for CL and 99.3% for MCL. Treatment with N-methylglucamine antimony was performed in 99.4% of the cases, but discontinuously used in the majority of patients. This study presents information which may be used as a tool for the epidemiological surveillance and control of the disease in Xapuri, a region which depends essentially on forest resources and ecological tourism.

TI  - Geographical Distribution of <i>Aedes aegypti aegypti</i> and <i>Aedes aegypti formosus</i> (Diptera: Culicidae) in Kenya and Environmental Factors Related to Their Relative Abundance
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - The mosquito Aedes aegypti (L.) is the primary vector of various infectious viruses and is typified by a polymorphic color and abundance of white scales on the body. It has been conventionally separated into two subspecies, Ae. aeg. formosus (Walker) (Aaf) and Ae. aeg. aegypti (L.) (Aaa), with Aaf considered a 'sylvan' form and Aaa a 'domestic' form. Because the two subspecies show different susceptibilities to dengue viruses it is important to understand their distribution. In this study, we collected larvae from artificial and natural habitats in southern Kenya and reared them to adults to morphologically identify subspecies. We describe the geographical distribution and relative abundance of Aaa and Aaf in Kenya, and estimate the environmental factors associated with their distributions by GIS using climate and environment data. A total of 5,243 Ae. aegypti adults were collected from 249 sites, with Aaa accounting for 22% of the specimens. The relative abundance of Aaa was higher in coastal areas versus sites in western Kenya. Aaa abundance was also higher in urbanized than forested areas, which is consistent with known ecology. In contrast and inconsistent with previous studies, both Aaa and Aaf were sympatric in artificial and natural habitats. The high relative abundance of Aaa in coastal areas might derive from old populated cities, climate, and/or introduction from abroad.

TI  - Mayaro Virus Infection in Amazonia: A Multimodel Inference Approach to Risk Factor Assessment
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background: Arboviral diseases are major global public health threats. Yet, our understanding of infection risk factors is, with a few exceptions, considerably limited. A crucial shortcoming is the widespread use of analytical methods generally not suited for observational data - particularly null hypothesis-testing (NHT) and step-wise regression (SWR). Using Mayaro virus (MAYV) as a case study, here we compare information theory-based multimodel inference (MMI) with conventional analyses for arboviral infection risk factor assessment.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: A cross-sectional survey of anti-MAYV antibodies revealed 44% prevalence (n = 270 subjects) in a central Amazon rural settlement. NHT suggested that residents of village-like household clusters and those using closed toilet/latrines were at higher risk, while living in non-village-like areas, using bednets, and owning fowl, pigs or dogs were protective. The "minimum adequate" SWR model retained only residence area and bednet use. Using MMI, we identified relevant covariates, quantified their relative importance, and estimated effect-sizes (beta +/- SE) on which to base inference. Residence area (beta(Village) = 2.93 +/- 0.41; beta(Upland) = -0.56 +/- 0.33, beta(Riverbanks) = -2.37 +/- 0.55) and bednet use (beta = -0.95 +/- 0.28) were the most important factors, followed by crop-plot ownership (beta = 0.39 +/- 0.22) and regular use of a closed toilet/latrine (beta = 0.19 +/- 0.13); domestic animals had insignificant protective effects and were relatively unimportant. The SWR model ranked fifth among the 128 models in the final MMI set.
   Conclusions/Significance: Our analyses illustrate how MMI can enhance inference on infection risk factors when compared with NHT or SWR. MMI indicates that forest crop-plot workers are likely exposed to typical MAYV cycles maintained by diurnal, forest dwelling vectors; however, MAYV might also be circulating in nocturnal, domestic-peridomestic cycles in village-like areas. This suggests either a vector shift (synanthropic mosquitoes vectoring MAYV) or a habitat/habits shift (classical MAYV vectors adapting to densely populated landscapes and nocturnal biting); any such ecological/adaptive novelty could increase the likelihood of MAYV emergence in Amazonia.

TI  - Spatiotemporal epidemiology, environmental correlates, and demography of malaria in Tak Province, Thailand (2012-2015)
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
AB  - BackgroundTak Province, at the Thai-Myanmar border, is one of three high malaria incidence areas in Thailand. This study aimed to describe and identify possible factors driving the spatiotemporal trends of disease incidence from 2012 to 2015.MethodsClimate variables and forest cover were correlated with malaria incidence using Pearson's r. Statistically significant clusters of high (hot spots) and low (cold spots) annual parasite incidence per 1000 population (API) were identified using Getis-Ord Gi* statistic.ResultsThe total number of confirmed cases declined by 76% from 2012 to 2015 (Plasmodium falciparum by 81%, Plasmodium vivax by 73%). Incidence was highly seasonal with two main annual peaks. Most cases were male (62.75%), >= 15years (56.07%), and of Myanmar (56.64%) or Thai (39.25%) nationality. Median temperature (1- and 2-month lags), average temperature (1- and 2-month lags) and average relative humidity (2- and 3-month lags) correlated positively with monthly total, P. falciparum and P. vivax API. Total rainfall in the same month correlated with API for total cases and P. vivax but not P. falciparum. At sub-district level, percentage forest cover had a low positive correlation with P. falciparum, P. vivax, and total API in most years. There was a decrease in API in most sub-districts for both P. falciparum and P. vivax. Sub-districts with the highest API were in the Tha Song Yang and Umphang Districts along the Thai-Myanmar border. Annual hot spots were mostly in the extreme north and south of the province.ConclusionsThere has been a large decline in reported clinical malaria from 2012 to 2015 in Tak Province. API was correlated with monthly climate and annual forest cover but these did not account for the trends over time. Ongoing elimination interventions on one or both sides of the border are more likely to have been the cause but it was not possible to assess this due to a lack of suitable data. Two main hot spot areas were identified that could be targeted for intensified elimination activities.

TI  - Induced resistance to Fusarium wilt of banana caused by Tropical Race 4 in Cavendish cv Grand Naine bananas after challenging with avirulent <i>Fusarium</i> spp.
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - In the last century, Fusarium wilt of banana (FWB) destroyed the banana cultivar Gros Michel. The Cavendish cultivars saved the global banana industry, and currently they dominate global production (similar to 50%) and the export trade (similar to 95%). However, a new strain called Tropical Race 4 (TR4) surfaced in the late 1960's, spread globally and greatly damages Cavendish plantations as well as manifold local varieties that are primarily grown by small holders. Presently, there is no commercially available replacement for Cavendish and hence control strategies must be developed and implemented to manage FWB. Here, we studied whether it is possible to induce resistance to TR4 by pre-inoculations with different Fusarium spp. Only pre-treatments with an avirulent Race 1 strain significantly reduced disease development of TR4 in a Cavendish genotype and this effect was stable at various nutritional and pH conditions. We then used transcriptome analysis to study the molecular basis of this response. Several genes involved in plant defence responses were up-regulated during the initial stages of individual infections with TR4 and Race 1, as well as in combined treatments. In addition, a number of genes in the ethylene and jasmonate response pathways as well as several gibberellin synthesis associated genes were induced. We observed upregulation of RGA2 like genes in all treatments. Hence, RGA2 could be a key factor involved in both R1 and TR4 resistance. The data support the hypothesis that activating resistance to Race 1 in Cavendish bananas affects TR4 development and provide a first insight of gene expression during the interaction between various Fusarium spp. and banana.

TI  - Human Cysticercosis in Asia: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
T2  - IRANIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Background: Cysticercosis in among the neglected tropical disease caused by eating the egg of parasite Taenia solium. In this review, we aimed to verify the prevalence of human cysticercosis in different countries of Asia using systematic review and meta-analysis approach.
   Methods: Based of the protocol, reliable databases including PubMed, SCOPUS, Science Direct, Embase, and Cochrane Library from 1990-2018 were searched using a panel of keywords. Overall, 48 countries of Asia were searched in turn and data were analyzed using a category of statistical tests.
   Results: Out of 28 included studies, 586175 samples were collected and included in the data analysis. Based on the meta-analysis results, the overall pooled percent of cysticercosis was estimated 3.8% (95% CI: [2.0, 7.0]). According to the result of heterogeneity statistics including I-squared, chi-square, and tau-squared, it was statistically significant (Tau2 = 2.94, chi2 = 12733.31, P<0.001, I2 = 100%) therefore a random effect model was used to handle the heterogeneity of studies. To evaluate the trend of cysticercosis over the time, Cumulative meta-analysis was performed and the result showed that there was a minor upward tendency in the prevalence of cysticercosis over the time.
   Conclusion: Although, considering the religious culture and food habits in Asia, we might have expected to witness a low prevalence of human cysticercosis, but we noticed more or less significant infection in some countries of the region. Regarding the new feature of immigration and travel between countries, all authorities are advised to take measures on controlling and monitoring the disease.

TI  - An assessment of remotely sensed environmental variables on Dengue epidemiology in Central India
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - In recent decades, dengue has been expanding rapidly in the tropical cities. Even though environmental factors and landscape features profoundly impact dengue vector abundance and disease epidemiology, significant gaps exist in understanding the role of local environmental heterogeneity on dengue epidemiology in India. In this study, we assessed the role of remotely sensed climatic factors (rainfall, temperature and humidity) and landscape variables (land use pattern, vegetation and built up density) on dengue incidence (2012-2019) in Bhopal city, Central India. Dengue hotspots in the city were assessed through geographical information system based spatial statistics. Dengue incidence increased from 0.59 cases in 2012 to 9.11 cases in 2019 per 10,000 inhabitants, and wards located in Southern Bhopal were found to be dengue hotspots. Distributed lag non-linear model combined with quasi Poisson regression was used to assess the exposure-response association, relative risk (RR), and delayed effects of environmental factors on dengue incidence. The analysis revealed a non-linear relationship between meteorological variables and dengue cases. The model shows that the risk of dengue cases increases with increasing mean temperature, rainfall and absolute humidity. The highest RR of dengue cases (similar to 2.0) was observed for absolute humidity >= 60 g/m(3) with a 5-15 week lag. Rapid urbanization assessed by an increase in the built-up area (a 9.1% increase in 2020 compared to 2014) could also be a key factor driving dengue incidence in Bhopal city. The study sheds important insight into the synergistic effects of both the landscape and climatic factors on the transmission dynamics of dengue. Furthermore, the study provides key baseline information on the climatic variables that can be used in the micro-level dengue prediction models in Bhopal and other cities with similar climatic conditions.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variability and trends of rainfall and temperature in the tropical moist montane ecosystem: Implications to climate-smart agriculture in Geshy watershed, Southwest Ethiopia
T2  - CLIMATE SERVICES
AB  - This paper examines the spatio-temporal trends and variability of temperature and rainfall in Geshi Watershed of South Western Ethiopia. The available gridded daily rainfall and temperature data managed by Ethiopian Na-tional Meteorological Agency (NMA) for 1986-2020 was used. Spatial variability and temporal trends of tem-perature and rainfall were analyzed using XLSTAT and ArcGIS 10.8 software. The Mann-Kendall test was used for trend analysis. Variability analysis was also done using the coefficient of variation and precipitation concen-tration index. The study reveals constant increasing trends in rainfall; and insignificant and high variability but increasing trends of temperature. The variabilities and trends justify the spatio-temporal differences along different seasons (spring locally known as 'belg', summer locally known as 'kiremt', and annual). The watershed is characterized by high to moderate rainfall coefficient of variation, significant years of high concentration of rainfall, and substantial negative annual rainfall anomalies; that severe variability was found in the summer-season. These variabilities and trends, especially late onset and early cessation of rainfall and increase in tem-perature created favorable conditions for insect and disease proliferation that eventually reduces agricultural productivity. Household income, which is solely based on agricultural production, declines which in turn affects household resilience. Maladaptation in the form of deforestation, fuelwood and charcoal selling, agricultural land expansion, and practicing input-intensive agriculture that contributes to greenhouse gas (GHG) emission-sare taken as an alternative livelihood strategy. In conclusion, spatiotemporal variabilities and trends of rainfall and temperature affect agricultural productivity, reduced household resilience leading to low adaptive capacity, and increased GHG emissions, which are known to be major pillars of climate-smart agriculture (CSA). In response, area-specific CSA technologies such as small-scale irrigation, improved animal husbandry, efficient inorganic fertilizer use, using manure, crop residue management, using high-yielding improved crop varieties, and using disease-resistant varieties are recommended.

TI  - MEMO: Mass Spectrometry-Based Sample Vectorization to Explore Chemodiverse Datasets
T2  - FRONTIERS IN BIOINFORMATICS
AB  - In natural products research, chemodiverse extracts coming from multiple organisms are explored for novel bioactive molecules, sometimes over extended periods. Samples are usually analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled with fragmentation mass spectrometry to acquire informative mass spectral ensembles. Such data is then exploited to establish relationships among analytes or samples (e.g., via molecular networking) and annotate metabolites. However, the comparison of samples profiled in different batches is challenging with current metabolomics methods since the experimental variation-changes in chromatographical or mass spectrometric conditions - hinders the direct comparison of the profiled samples. Here we introduce MEMO-MS2 BasEd SaMple VectOrization-a method allowing to cluster large amounts of chemodiverse samples based on their LC-MS/MS profiles in a retention time agnostic manner. This method is particularly suited for heterogeneous and chemodiverse sample sets. MEMO demonstrated similar clustering performance as state-of-the-art metrics considering fragmentation spectra. More importantly, such performance was achieved without the requirement of a prior feature alignment step and in a significantly shorter computational time. MEMO thus allows the comparison of vast ensembles of samples, even when analyzed over long periods of time, and on different chromatographic or mass spectrometry platforms. This new addition to the computational metabolomics toolbox should drastically expand the scope of large-scale comparative analysis.

TI  - Mayaro virus infection in French Guiana, a cross sectional study 2003-2019
T2  - INFECTION GENETICS AND EVOLUTION
AB  - Mayaro Virus is an emerging arbovirus which can be responsible of important outbreaks in tropical regions. A retrospective study was performed in French Guiana, an ultraperipheral region of Europe in Amazonia. We identified 17 human cases between 2003 and 2019. The clinical and biological picture was close to Chikungunya with fever and arthralgia. One patient had acute meningo-encephalitis, and 4 had persistent arthralgia. Physicians should be aware of this virus, as imported cases in Europe have already occurred.
   Author summary: Latin America has experienced several epidemics of arboviruses in recent years, some known for a long time, such as the dengue virus, and others of more recent introduction such as the chikungunya or Zika viruses. There are other arboviruses for the moment more discreet which are rife with low noise in several countries of the continent, such as the Mayaro virus. This alphavirus, with a presentation similar to that of the chikungunya virus, is currently confined to transmission by forest mosquitoes, but its potential to be transmitted by coastal mosquitoes such as Aedes aegypti, make it a potential candidate for a continent-wide epidemic. It therefore seems necessary to know this virus as well as possible in order to anticipate the occurrence of a possible new epidemic. We present here a both demographic and clinical study of this endemic arbovirus disease in French Guiana.

TI  - <i>In vitro</i> tissue culture in plants propagation and germplasm conservation of economically important species in Peru
T2  - SCIENTIA AGROPECUARIA
AB  - Plant biotechnology is one of the most important tools presently available and methods to genetically manipulate plants to exhibit greater productivity, tolerance to physical and chemical stress, and resistance to pests and diseases have been developed in recent decades. In vitro plant tissue culture has contributed significantly to this purpose. The objective of this study is to apply various techniques developed by in vitro tissue culture in seed germination, meristem culture for virus elimination, micropropagation, conservation, international transfer of germplasm, and induction of various morphogenic processes that lead to the genetic variability known as somaclonal variation. The application of this set of biotechnological techniques, in crops such as cassava, sweet potato, potato, native forest species as Cedrela odorata, Ficus spp. Loxopterygium huasango, and others, sugar cane, rice, pineapple, among other haves made it possible to meet, as a matter of improvement, several of the essential needs of farmers in the region of northern Peru. The development of these technologies will allow their wide application not only in the propagation, genetic improvement and conservation of species of economic importance, food and medicine, but also in the forest species of the seasonally dry tropical forest of northern Peru.

T2  - HYDROBIOLOGIA
CP  - 9th International Conference on Copepoda
AB  - The aim of the present study is to test by molecular DNA data a hypothesis concerned to speciation by allopatry occurring in Mimagoniates microlepis, associated to the Serra do Mar mountain chain (Atlantic Rain Forest hotspot) in Southern Brazil. Overall genetic diversity and mean genetic distances were high, demonstrating both good conservation status and genetic differentiation. Neighbor-Joining (NJ) and parsimony analyses, together with population genetic parameters (I broken vertical bar(ST), N-m, G(ST), and AMOVA), identified two main vicariant genetic/evolutionary stocks dividing the upper Igua double dagger u River samples from those of the coastal plains. Other well-supported intrinsic monophyletic clades were also identified, suggesting fast and remarkable speciation processes. In addition, the genetic, evolutionary, geographic, and phylogeographic evidences reinforced an occurring species complex. Moreover, these evolutionarily significant units (species complex) seem to be inside four natural biogeographic areas. Thus, the genesis and evolution of the Serra do Mar complex might be associated to diversification processes of M. microlepis. Such a consideration suggests that the areas including the upper Igua double dagger u River and the coastal plains of the states of SA o pound Paulo, Parana, and Santa Catarina require distinct conservation policies involving one of the global biodiversity hotspots, namely, the Brazilian Atlantic Rain Forest.

TI  - Re-Emergence of Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Virus in Central Africa
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background: Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a severe tick-borne disease well recognized through Europe and Asia where diagnostic tests and medical surveillance are available. However, it is largely neglected in Africa, especially in the tropical rainforest of Central Africa where only sporadic human cases have been reported and date back to more than 30 years. We describe here an isolated human case that occurred in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2008 and performed phylogenetic analysis to investigate whether it resulted from a regional re-emergence or from the introduction of a novel virus in the area.
   Methods and Findings: Near complete segment S and partial segment M sequences were characterized. Bayesian phylogenetic analysis and datation were performed to investigate the relationship between this new strain and viral strains from Africa, Europe and Asia. The new strain is phylogenetically close to the previously described regional genotype (II) that appears to be specific to Central Africa. Phylogenetic discrepancy between segment S and M suggested genetic exchange among local sublineages, which was dated back to 130-590 years before present.
   Conclusions: The phylogenetic analyses presented here suggest ongoing CCHF virus circulation in Central Africa for a long time despite the absence of reported human cases. Many infections have most probably been overlooked, due to the weakness of healthcare structures and the absence of available diagnostic procedure. However, despite the lack of accurate ecological data, the sporadic reporting of human cases could also be partly associated with a specific sylvatic cycle in Central Africa where deforestation may raise the risks of re-emergence. For these reasons, together with the high risk of nosocomial transmission, public health authorities' attention should be drawn to this etiological agent.

TI  - Evaluation of Yellow Sticky Traps Baited With Citrus Scents, Coconut Oil, and Commercial Lures as a Simple Tool to Monitor <i>Diaphorina citri</i> (Hemiptera: Liviidae) Under Tropical Dry Forest Conditions
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - Efficient, economic, and simple monitoring methods are important to develop successful integrated management for Asian citrus psyllid (ACP) especially in developing countries. Two 5-wk tests were carried out to study the capture of ACP adults using yellow sticky traps by adding commercial citrus fruit scents (lemon, tangerine, or orange) or commercial coconut oil (first test) and to compare these baits with commercial lures (Alpha Scents and Pest Wizard) (second test) under natural infestation conditions. In the first test, the following treatments were carried out: yellow sticky traps baited with 1) coconut oil; 2) lemon, tangerine, or orange commercial scents; or 3) unbaited yellow sticky tramps (control). In the second test, treatments were as follows: traps baited with 1) coconut oil; 2) lemon, tangerine, or orange commercial scents; 3) two different commercial lures (Pest Wizard and Alpha Scents); and 4) unbaited traps. In the first experiment, the results obtained showed that traps with a coconut oil lure captured 4.4 ACP adults per trap per week, whereas control traps caught 1 ACP adult. In the second test, coconut oil (4.5 adults per trap per week) and Alpha Scents (4.2 individuals) lures also exhibited a higher capture in comparison to all citrus scents (3.1 individuals) and Pest Wizard (3.5 individuals), and control (2 individuals). In conclusion, these results suggest that the use of commercial attractants, mainly coconut oil, can be more attractive than unbaited traps and this may be helpful for integrating into integrated pest management programs intended for ACP.

TI  - Spatially explicit predictions of blood parasites in a widely distributed African rainforest bird
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB  - Critical to the mitigation of parasitic vector-borne diseases is the development of accurate spatial predictions that integrate environmental conditions conducive to pathogen proliferation. Species of Plasmodium and Trypanosoma readily infect humans, and are also common in birds. Here, we develop predictive spatial models for the prevalence of these blood parasites in the olive sunbird (Cyanomitra olivacea). Since this species exhibits high natural parasite prevalence and occupies diverse habitats in tropical Africa, it represents a distinctive ecological model system for studying vector-borne pathogens. We used PCR and microscopy to screen for haematozoa from 28 sites in Central and West Africa. Species distribution models were constructed to associate ground-based and remotely sensed environmental variables with parasite presence. We then used machine-learning algorithm models to identify relationships between parasite prevalence and environmental predictors. Finally, predictive maps were generated by projecting model outputs to geographically unsampled areas. Results indicate that for Plasmodium spp., the maximum temperature of the warmest month was most important in predicting prevalence. For Trypanosoma spp., seasonal canopy moisture variability was the most important predictor. The models presented here visualize gradients of disease prevalence, identify pathogen hotspots and will be instrumental in studying the effects of ecological change on these and other pathogens.

TI  - Opportunities for beef production in developing countries of the southern hemisphere
T2  - LIVESTOCK SCIENCE
AB  - Developing countries from the southern hemisphere have similarities in terms of climatic and agricultural conditions and cattle are the most important livestock species in these countries which leads to many areas of similar interest and opportunities regarding beef cattle production. The increase in demand for meat in developing countries offers large market opportunities for livestock producers. If the productivity of beef farmers can be improved to commercial levels, it may have the potential to address poverty in these agriculturally based economies. Climate change is predicted to be highly dynamic and can have adverse effects on crop and livestock productivity. The cattle breed to be used and the production strategy to be followed in developing countries of the southern hemisphere will depend primarily on the environment and level of management. The availability of diverse cattle breed resources with adaptive and productive differences will allow breed types to be matched to different environments, management capabilities and markets. In the harsh and undeveloped areas or pastoralist systems, pure breeding with e.g. Sanga, Zebu or naturalized breeds may be the only production strategy that can be followed. In the more developed areas, crossbreeding with small indigenous cows may succeed in improving the output of beef cattle farming. It is believed that crossbreeding will gain importance in many developing counties in the southern hemisphere. It is therefore essential that crossbreeding studies be conducted where necessary, to supply information regarding heterosis and for the development of multi-breed genetic evaluations, breeding objectives and decision making. By describing production environments it may be possible to identify genotypes that are adapted to a specific environment. However, tools are needed to overlay geo-referenced data sets onto the different environments. Statistical science continues to support animal breeding and improvement, especially with respect to production traits. Traits linked to fertility and/or survival are still problematic and the appropriate quantitative breeding technology to properly handle these traits still needs to be developed. Gene or marker assisted selection may play an important role in selection for disease and parasite resistance or tolerance, since it is generally difficult to measure these traits directly. Strategies that utilize EBVs derived from genomic analyses (genomic EBVs), together with conventional mixed model methodology, may speed up the process of breeding animals with subsequent higher and more efficient production. The application of a landscape genetics approach offers the potential to greatly enhance the knowledge of how landscape heterogeneity influences the genetic population structure, gene flow, and adaptation. Results from these studies can be used to address questions related to species management and conservation. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - ISOLATION OF A NEWLY RECOGNIZED ALPHAVIRUS FROM MOSQUITOS IN VIETNAM AND EVIDENCE FOR HUMAN INFECTION AND DISEASE
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - During studies of arboviral epidemiology in Vietnam, five virus isolates were recovered from Culex tritaeniorhynchus mosquitoes. Three of the five isolates were identified as strains of Japanese encephalitis virus, but the others, collected at Me Tri village, Hanoi, were shown to represent an alphavirus, for which we propose the name Me Tri virus. This newly recognized virus is most closely related to Semliki Forest virus. The two isolates appear to be antigenic subtypes of a single virus, and each was associated with central nervous system illnesses in children. Serologic surveys indicate widespread distribution of these viruses in both humans and livestock in Vietnam. We suggest that Me Tri virus is an etiologic agent of human disease in southeast Asia.

Ticks have several morphologic features and physiologic mechanisms that facilitate host selection, ingestion of vertebrate blood, mating, survival, and reproduction. Although the natural history of ticks varies considerably among species, these arthropods are well-adapted to survive in tropical, temperate, and even subarctic habitats. Key factors, including the reversion of agricultural lands to forests and a close association between people and ticks, have greatly increased the risk of tick bite and human disease.

TI  - Haemosporidian parasites in the ash-breasted Sierra finch (<i>Geospizopsis plebejus</i>): insights from an Andean dry forest population
T2  - PARASITOLOGY
AB  - Haemosporidian genera Plasmodium, Haemoproteus and Leucocytozoon, responsible for avian malarial infections, are highly diverse and have a wide range of health effects and predictors, depending on the host and its environmental context. Here, we present, for the first time, detailed information on the identity, prevalence and parasitaemia of haemosporidians and other haemoparasites that infect the ash-breasted Sierra finch, Geospizopsis plebejus, in an Andean dry forest. We study the consequences of infection in the host body and health conditions and explore the environmental and intrinsic factors that influence infection status and parasitaemia. We conducted diagnoses by cytochrome b (cytb) sequencing and morphological identification, and estimated the levels of parasitaemia based on microscopy. We identified 6 cytb lineages infecting G. plebejus. Two of them were new lineages: Haemoproteus sp. GEPLE01 and GEPLE02. We also detected Haemoproteus sp. ZOCAP08, Haemoproteus sp. AMAVIR01, Plasmodium homopolare BAEBIC02 and Plasmodium cathemerium ZONCAP15. By microscopy, we detected Haemoproteus coatneyi, Haemoproteus erythrogravidus, P. homopolare and other unidentified species of Haemoproteus, Plasmodium, Babesia sp. and 1 microfilaria. We found no evidence of Leucocytozoon. Additionally, we detected several coinfections by sequencing and microscopy. The prevalence of haemosporidian infections was high (87.7%), and the mean parasitaemia was 61.65 infected cells per 10 000 erythrocytes examined. Prevalence and parasitaemia were higher for Haemoproteus than for Plasmodium. Haemoproteus sp. AMAVIR01 showed the highest prevalence (43.1%) and mean parasitaemia (94.39/10 000 erythrocytes) and might be associated with H. coatneyi. Immature individuals showed a lower prevalence than adults, supporting previous findings.

TI  - Antiparasitic effect of essential oils obtained from two species of Piper L. native to the Atlantic forest
T2  - BIOCATALYSIS AND AGRICULTURAL BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB  - Neglected tropical diseases such as leishmaniasis and Chagas disease have difficult management, as their causative agents demonstrate resistance to the currently available drugs. Therefore, the development of novel antiparasitic compounds is urgent. This study investiga ted the chemical composition, cytotoxicity and antiparasitic activities of the essential oils of Piper diospyrifolium (EOPD) and Piper mikanianum (EOPM). The chemical composition was determined by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. The anti-parasitic activity was assessed using Leishmania spp. promastigotes and T. cruzi epimastigotes. The cytotoxicity of the essential oils was determined using the murine line of fibroblasts 929 NTCT. The phenylpropanoids (Z)-carpacin and safrole were identified as major compounds in the essential oils of P. diospyrifolium and P. mikanianum, respectively. At highest concentration (1000 mu g/mL), none of the of essential oils caused 100% of the lethality in T. cruzi epimastigotes. The DPO presented significant anti-parasitic ac tion against L. braziliensis at concentrations above 31.25 mu g/mL (35.34% inhibition), reaching maximum effect (100% inhibition) at 1000 mu g/mL. At the same concentration, the EOPM caused 94.25% mortality. The DPO also caused 100% mortality of L. infantum at 1000 mu g/mL, demonstratin g promising antiparasi tic activity against this strain. The esse ntial oils exhibited low cytotoxicity when compared to standard antiparasitic drugs, indicating that are promising sources of new compounds with antiparasitic activity.

TI  - Genetic variation and phylogeography of the Triatoma dimidiata complex evidence a potential center of origin and recent divergence of haplogroups having differential Trypanosoma cruzi and DTU infections
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - The population genetics of Triatoma dimidiata haplogroups was analyzed at landscape and sub-regional scales in Chiapas and regional level across the Mexican Neotropics, and phylogeography of the complex was re-analyzed across its complete geographic range. Two contiguous fragments of the ND4 gene were analyzed due to bias from differential haplogroup specificity using a previously designed sequence. At both landscape (anthropic modification gradient) and regional (demographic, fragmentation, biogeographic, climate) scales, lowest T. dimidiata genetic diversity occurs where there is greatest historical anthropic modification, and where T. cruzi infection prevalence is significantly highest. Trypanosoma cruzi prevalence was significantly higher than expected in haplogroups 1 and 3, while lower than expected in haplogroup 2. There was also a significant difference of DTUI and DTUVI infection frequencies in both haplogroups 1 and 3, while no difference of either in haplogroup 2. All haplogroups from the Mexican Neotropics had moderate to high haplotype diversity, while greatest genetic differentiation was between haplogroups 1 and 3 (above F-ST = 0.868, p < 0.0001). Divergence of the complex from the MRCA was estimated between 0.97 MYA (95% HPD interval = 0.55-1.53 MYA) and 0.85 MYA (95% HPD interval = 0.42-1.5 MYA) for ND4A and both concatenated fragments, respectively, with primary divergence from the MRCA of haplogroups 2 and 3. Effective population size for Mexican haplogroups 1 and 2 increased between 0.02 and 0.03 MYA. This study supports previous ecological niche evidence for the complexs origin surrounding the Tehuantepec Isthmus, and provides evidence for recent divergence of three primary dimidiata haplogroups, with differential T. cruzi infection frequency and DTU specificity, important components of vector capacity.
   Author summary Triatoma dimidiata is one of the broadest distributed triatomine species ' complexes transmitting Trypanosoma cruzi. In Mexico, three haplogroups of the T. dimidiata complex have been reported and all are primary vectors of Chagas disease south of the Tehuantepec Isthmus. Given their epidemiological importance, the question arises whether haplogroups have similar genetic diversity in domestic/modified landscapes, as well as infection characteristics and parasite DTU associations, key components of vector capacity. The aim of the present study was to analyze Triatoma dimidiata population genetics across landscapes, sub-regional, regional, and global Neotropical realm scales, using two contiguous fragments of the ND4 gene. Our results support previous evidence for the complex ' s origin surrounding the Tehuantepec Isthmus, and provides evidence for recent divergence of three principal dimidiata haplogroups and significant secondary divergence within each. Differential T. cruzi prevalence and Discrete Typing Unit (DTU) specificity for individual haplogroups provide evidence for potential differential vector capacity within the complex in Mexico.

TI  - Identifying the natural compound Catechin from tropical mangrove plants as a potential lead candidate against 3CL<SUP>pro</SUP> from SARS-CoV-2: An integrated <i>in silico</i> approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOMOLECULAR STRUCTURE & DYNAMICS
AB  - SARS-CoV-2, a member of beta coronaviruses, is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. With global fatalities of the pandemic exceeding 4.57 million, it becomes crucial to identify effective therapeutics against the virus. A protease, 3CL(pro,) is responsible for the proteolysis of viral polypeptides into functional proteins, which is essential for viral pathogenesis. This indispensable activity of 3CL(pro) makes it an attractive target for inhibition studies. The current study aimed to identify potential lead molecules against 3CL(pro) of SARS-CoV-2 using a manually curated inhouse library of antiviral compounds from mangrove plants. This study employed the structure-based virtual screening technique to evaluate an in-house library of antiviral compounds against 3CLpro of SARS-CoV-2. The library was comprised of thirty-three experimentally proven antiviral molecules extracted from different species of tropical mangrove plants. The molecules in the library were virtually screened using AutoDock Vina, and subsequently, the top five promising 3CL(pro)-ligand complexes along with 3CL(pro)-N3 (control molecule) complex were subjected to MD simulations to comprehend their dynamic behaviour and structural stabilities. Finally, the MM/PBSA approach was used to calculate the binding free energies of 3CL(pro) complexes. Among all the studied compounds, Catechin achieved the most significant binding free energy (-40.3 +/- 3.1 kcal/mol), and was closest to the control molecule (-42.8 +/- 5.1 kcal/mol), and its complex with 3CL(pro) exhibited the highest structural stability. Through extensive computational investigations, we propose Catechin as a potential therapeutic agent against SARS-CoV-2.

TI  - Evidence for temporal population replacement and the signature of ecological adaptation in a major Neotropical malaria vector in Amazonian Peru
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
AB  - Background: The major Neotropical malaria vector, Anopheles darlingi, was reintroduced into the Iquitos, Loreto, Peru area during the early 1990s, where it displaced other anophelines and caused a major malaria epidemic. Since then, case numbers in Loreto have fluctuated, but annual increases have been reported since 2012.
   Methods: The population genetic structure of An. darlingi sampled before and after the introduction of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) was investigated to test the hypothesis of temporal population change (2006 vs. 2012). Current samples of An. darlingi were used to test the hypothesis of ecological adaptation to human modified (highway) compared with wild (riverine) habitat, linked to forest cover. In total, 693 An. darlingi from nine localities in Loreto, Peru area were genotyped using 13 microsatellite loci. To test the hypothesis of habitat differentiation in An. darlingi biting time patterns, HBR and EIR, four collections of An. darlingi from five localities (two riverine and three highway) were analysed.
   Results: Analyses of microsatellite loci from seven (2006) and nine settlements (2012-2014) in the Iquitos area detected two distinctive populations with little overlap, although it is unclear whether this population replacement event is associated with LLIN distribution or climate. Within the 2012-2014 population two admixed subpopulations, A and B, were differentiated by habitat, with B significantly overrepresented in highway, and both in near-equal proportions in riverine. Both subpopulations had a signature of expansion and there was moderate genetic differentiation between them. Habitat and forest cover level had significant effects on HBR, such that Plasmodium transmission risk, as measured by EIR, in peridomestic riverine settlements was threefold higher than in peridomestic highway settlements. HBR was directly associated with available host biomass rather than forest cover.
   Conclusions: A population replacement event occurred between 2006 and 2012-2014, concurrently with LLIN distribution and a moderate El Nino event, and prior to an increase in malaria incidence. The likely drivers of this replacement cannot be determined with current data. The present-day An. darlingi population is composed of two highly admixed subpopulations, which appear to be in an early stage of differentiation, triggered by anthropogenic alterations to local habitat.

TI  - Socio-epidemiological and land cover risk factors for melioidosis in Kedah, Northern Malaysia
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background Melioidosis, a fatal infectious disease caused by Burkholderia pseudomallei, is increasingly diagnosed in tropical regions. However, data on risk factors and the geographic epidemiology of the disease are still limited. Previous studies have also largely been based on the analysis of case series data. Here, we undertook a more definitive hospital-based matched case-control study coupled with spatial analysis to identify demographic, socioeconomic and landscape risk factors for bacteremic melioidosis in the Kedah region of northern Malaysia.
   Methodology/Principal findings We obtained patient demographic and residential information and clinical presentation and medical history data from 254 confirmed melioidosis cases and 384 matched controls attending Hospital Sultanah Bahiyah (HSB), the main tertiary hospital of Alor Setar, the capital city of Kedah, during the period between 2005 and 2011. Crude and adjusted odds ratios employing conditional logistic regression analysis were used to assess if melioidosis in this region is related to risk factors connected with socio-demographics, various behavioural characteristics, and co-occurring diseases. Spatial clusters of cases were determined using a continuous Poisson model as deployed in SaTScan. A land cover map in conjunction with mapped case data was used to determine disease-land type associations using the Fisher's exact test deploying simulated p-values. Crude and adjusted odds ratios indicate that melioidosis in this region is related to gender (males), race, occupation (farming) and co-occurring chronic diseases, particularly diabetes. Spatial analyses of disease incidence, however, showed that disease risk and geographic clustering of cases are related strongly to land cover types, with risk of disease increasing non-linearly with the degree of human modification of the natural ecosystem.
   Conclusions/Significance These findings indicate that melioidosis represents a complex socio-ecological public health problem in Kedah, and that its control requires an understanding and modification of the coupled human and natural variables that govern disease transmission in endemic communities.

TI  - Malaria Determined Military Outcomes in Burma (Myanmar) Across Three Centuries
T2  - JOURNAL OF MILITARY AND VETERANS HEALTH
AB  - Disease has often determined the outcome of tropical military campaigns. This is especially true in Burma (Myanmar), where entire armies have been incapacitated by fever thought to be due to malaria during the Sino-Burmese Wars (1765-1769), the Anglo-Burmese Wars (especially the first in 1824-1826) and World War II (1942-1945) when the British 14th Army fought against the Imperial Japanese Army. The monsoon limits military activity logistically, but malaria following the rains still can incapacitate armies, particularly in forested areas favoured by the Anopheles vector. Strict discipline applied to imperfect chemoprophylaxis was successful in World War II and will be required in any future conflicts. Political instability in parts of Southeast Asia continues to make malaria a disease of abiding military medical interest and necessitates better forms of chemoprophylaxis.

TI  - Global Spread of Human Chromoblastomycosis Is Driven by Recombinant <i>Cladophialophora carrionii</i> and Predominantly Clonal <i>Fonsecaea</i> Species
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Global distribution patterns of Cladophialophora carrionii, agent of human chromoblastomycosis in arid climates of Africa, Asia, Australia, Central-and South-America, were compared with similar data of the vicarious Fonsecaea spp., agents of the disease in tropical rain forests. Population diversities among 73 C. carrionii strains and 60 strains of three Fonsecaea species were analyzed for rDNA ITS, partial beta-tubulin, and amplified fragment-length polymorphism (AFLP) fingerprints. Populations differed significantly between continents. Lowest haplotype diversity was found in South American populations, while African strains were the most diverse. Gene flow was noted between the African population and all other continents. The general pattern of Fonsecaea agents of chromoblastomycosis differed significantly from that of C. carrionii and revealed deeper divergence among three differentiated species with smaller numbers of haplotypes, indicating a longer evolutionary history.

TI  - Disease Dynamics in a Specialized Parasite of Ant Societies
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Coevolution between ant colonies and their rare specialized parasites are intriguing, because lethal infections of workers may correspond to tolerable chronic diseases of colonies, but the parasite adaptations that allow stable coexistence with ants are virtually unknown. We explore the trade-offs experienced by Ophiocordyceps parasites manipulating ants into dying in nearby graveyards. We used field data from Brazil and Thailand to parameterize and fit a model for the growth rate of graveyards. We show that parasite pressure is much lower than the abundance of ant cadavers suggests and that hyperparasites often castrate Ophiocordyceps. However, once fruiting bodies become sexually mature they appear robust. Such parasite life-history traits are consistent with iteroparity-a reproductive strategy rarely considered in fungi. We discuss how tropical habitats with high biodiversity of hyperparasites and high spore mortality has likely been crucial for the evolution and maintenance of iteroparity in parasites with low dispersal potential.

TI  - Phylodynamic Inference of Bacterial Outbreak Parameters Using Nanopore Sequencing
T2  - MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB  - Nanopore sequencing and phylodynamic modeling have been used to reconstruct the transmission dynamics of viral epidemics, but their application to bacterial pathogens has remained challenging. Cost-effective bacterial genome sequencing and variant calling on nanopore platforms would greatly enhance surveillance and outbreak response in communities without access to sequencing infrastructure. Here, we adapt random forest models for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) polishing developed by Sanderson and colleagues (2020. High precision Neisseria gonorrhoeae variant and antimicrobial resistance calling from metagenomic nanopore sequencing. Genome Res. 30(9):1354-1363) to estimate divergence and effective reproduction numbers (R-e) of two methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) outbreaks from remote communities in Far North Queensland and Papua New Guinea (PNG; n = 159). Successive barcoded panels of S. aureus isolates (2 x 12 per MinION) sequenced at low coverage (>5x to 10x) provided sufficient data to accurately infer genotypes with high recall when compared with Illumina references. Random forest models achieved high resolution on ST93 outbreak sequence types (>90% accuracy and precision) and enabled phylodynamic inference of epidemiological parameters using birth-death skyline models. Our method reproduced phylogenetic topology, origin of the outbreaks, and indications of epidemic growth (R-e > 1). Nextflow pipelines implement SNP polisher training, evaluation, and outbreak alignments, enabling reconstruction of within-lineage transmission dynamics for infection control of bacterial disease outbreaks on portable nanopore platforms. Our study shows that nanopore technology can be used for bacterial outbreak reconstruction at competitive costs, providing opportunities for infection control in hospitals and communities without access to sequencing infrastructure, such as in remote northern Australia and PNG.

TI  - Species-specific ecological niche modelling predicts different range contractions for <i>Lutzomyia intermedia</i> and a related vector of <i>Leishmania braziliensis</i> following climate change in South America
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
AB  - Background: Before 1996 the phlebotomine sand fly Lutzomyia neivai was usually treated as a synonym of the morphologically similar Lutzomyia intermedia, which has long been considered a vector of Leishmania braziliensis, the causative agent of much cutaneous leishmaniasis in South America. This report investigates the likely range changes of both sand fly species in response to a stabilisation climate change scenario (RCP4.5) and a high greenhouse gas emissions one (RCP8.5).
   Methods: Ecological niche modelling was used to identify areas of South America with climates currently suitable for each species, and then the future distributions of these climates were predicted based on climate change scenarios. Compared with the previous ecological niche model of L. intermedia (sensu lato) produced using the GARP algorithm in 2003, the current investigation modelled the two species separately, making use of verified presence records and additional records after 2001. Also, the new ensemble approach employed ecological niche modelling algorithms (including Maximum Entropy, Random Forests and Support Vector Machines) that have been widely adopted since 2003 and perform better than GARP, as well as using a more recent climate change model (HadGEM2) considered to have better performance at higher resolution than the earlier one (HadCM2).
   Results: Lutzomyia intermedia was shown to be the more tropical of the two species, with its climatic niche defined by higher annual mean temperatures and lower temperature seasonality, in contrast to the more subtropical L. neivai. These different latitudinal ranges explain the two species' predicted responses to climate change by 2050, with L. intermedia mostly contracting its range (except perhaps in northeast Brazil) and L. neivai mostly shifting its range southwards in Brazil and Argentina. This contradicts the findings of the 2003 report, which predicted more range expansion. The different findings can be explained by the improved data sets and modelling methods.
   Conclusions: Our findings indicate that climate change will not always lead to range expansion of disease vectors such as sand flies. Ecological niche models should be species specific, carefully selected and combined in an ensemble approach.

TI  - Disease Prevalence and Snail Predation Associated with Swell-Generated Damage on the Threatened Coral, <i>Acropora palmata</i> (Lamarck)
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
AB  - Disturbances such as tropical storms cause coral mortality and reduce coral cover as a direct result of physical damage. Storms can be one of the most important disturbances in coral reef ecosystems, and it is crucial to understand their long-term impacts on coral populations. The primary objective of this study was to determine trends in disease prevalence and snail predation on damaged and undamaged colonies of the threatened coral species, Acropora palmate, following an episode of heavy ocean swells in the US Virgin Islands (USVI). At three sites on St. Thomas and St. John, colonies of A. palmata were surveyed monthly over 1 year following a series of large swells in March 2008 that fragmented 30-93% of colonies on monitored reefs. Post-disturbance surveys conducted from April 2008 through March 2009 showed that swell-generated damage to A. palmata caused negative indirect effects that compounded the initial direct effects of physical disturbance. During the 12 months after the swell event, white pox disease prevalence was 41% higher for colonies that sustained damage from the swells than for undamaged colonies (df = 207, p = 0.01) with greatest differences in disease prevalence occurring during warm water months. In addition, the corallivorous snail, Coralliophila abbreviata, was 46% more abundant on damaged corals than undamaged corals during the 12 months after the swell event (df = 207, p = 0.006).

TI  - Relevance of wood anatomy and size of Amazonian trees in the determination and allometry of sapwood area
T2  - ACTA AMAZONICA
AB  - Hydrological processes in forest stands are mainly influenced by tree species composition and morpho-physiological characteristics. Few studies on anatomical patterns that govern plant hydraulics were conducted in tropical forest ecosystems. Thus, we used dye immersion to analyze sapwood area patterns of 34 trees belonging to 26 species from a terra firme forest in the central Brazilian Amazon. The sapwood area was related with wood anatomy and tree size parameters (diameter-at-breast-height - DBH, total height and estimated whole-tree volume). Exponential allometric equations were used to model sapwood area using the biometrical variables measured. Sapwood area traits (cross-section non-uniformity and heartwood visibility) varied significantly among and within species even though all were classified as diffuse porous. DBH was strongly and non-linearly correlated with sapwood area (R-2 = 0.46, P < 0.001), while no correlation was observed with vessel-lumen diameter (P = 0.94) and frequency (P = 0.58). Sapwood area and shape were also affected by the occurrence of vessel obstruction (i.e., tyloses), hollow stems and diseases. Our results suggest that sapwood area patterns and correlated variables are driven by intrinsic species characteristics, microclimate and ecological succcssion within the stand. We believe that individual tree sapwood characteristics have strong implications over water use, hydrological stand upsaling and biomass quantification. These characteristics should be taken into account (e.g., through a multi-point sampling approach) when estimating forest stand transpiration in a highly biodiverse ecosystem.

TI  - Effects of seedling size, El Nino drought, seedling density, and distance to nearest conspecific adult on 6-year survival of <i>Ocotea whitei</i> seedlings in Panama
T2  - OECOLOGIA
AB  - We present an analysis of the long-term survival of two cohorts of seedlings of the tropical canopy tree Ocotea whitei (Lauraceae) on a 1-ha plot of mature, lowland moist forest on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. In 1980, we counted an even-aged cohort of seedlings that germinated in 1979, then measured and tagged survivors in 1981. We also measured and tagged a second, smaller cohort of seedlings that germinated in 1981. We followed the subsequent survival of all seedlings through 1985, Seedling mortality was phenotypically, temporally, and spatially non-random. Important correlates of nonrandom mortality included: (l)seedling size and age, (2) an El Nino drought, and (3) biotic neighborhood. Larger and older seedlings survived better than smaller and younger seedlings, respectively, and the El Nino-related drought of 1982-1983 was associated with elevated mortality rates. Seedling density, which was strongly correlated with the proximity to the nearest conspecific adult, increased mortality. The observed mortality patterns suggest that processes consistent with the Janzen-Connell hypothesis operate during the recruitment phase of O. whitei population dynamics. However, the processes causing the observed density- and distance-dependent mortality may vary with factors such as total seed number, seedling size, and climatic variation, making it difficult to determine whether time-integrated seedling-to-adult spacing mechanisms other than self-thinning operate on a given plant population. After 6 years in the hectare studied, survivors remained densest and most numerous underneath the adult trees. We conclude that only long-term demographic data, collected at a variety of scales on a variety of species, will ultimately answer the question: do Janzen-Connell effects contribute substantially to structuring tropical forests?.

TI  - Estimating seed and pollen dispersal kernels from genetic data demonstrates a high pollen dispersal capacity for an endangered palm species
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
AB  - Premise of the Study Methods Seed and pollen dispersal are key processes shaping plant population dynamics and maintaining genetic diversity. The essence of these processes is the movement of propagules from a parental tree to the site of propagule establishment. The estimation of plant dispersal kernels has remained challenging due to the difficulty of making direct observations. We estimated the dispersal capacity of the endangered palm Euterpe edulis, whose seeds are dispersed by vertebrates and pollen by insects. We used a hierarchical Bayesian model with genetic data from reproductive plants, juveniles, and embryos to estimate dispersal kernels. Our analyses account for genotyping error and uncertainty in parental assignment. Key Results Conclusions We found that seeds were dispersed at most a few hundred meters, but pollen was dispersed up to several kilometers. We hypothesize that this long-distance pollen dispersal is generated mainly by euglossine bees, whereas the main dispersal vectors for short-distance seed dispersal are thrushes. The long-distance dispersal of pollen suggests a high level of gene flow that should maintain genetic diversity of E. edulis. Despite the relation between long-distance dispersal and genetic diversity, we observed low genetic diversity and inbreeding within the local population, which are probably due to restricted gene flow due to the low density of this population and its aggregated spatial distribution. We conclude that if conservation actions are able to restore the population density of E. edulis, the recovery of its genetic diversity will be facilitated because of its high dispersal capacity, especially with regard to pollen.

TI  - Spatial distribution of avocado branch dieback and wilting (ABDW) vectored by ambrosia beetles in the Caribbean South America
T2  - TROPICAL PLANT PATHOLOGY
AB  - Avocado Branch Dieback and Wilting (ABDW) was recently reported on West-Indian avocado (Persea americana var. americana) orchards in the Serrania de Perija, Colombia. This disease is caused by Bionectria pseudochroleuca and transmitted by ambrosia beetles. In this work we estimated the potential distribution of ABDW to map avocado-growing areas at risk of ABDW in Colombia and Venezuela. Disease occurrence records were obtained from pest and disease surveys undertaken during 2014-2015 period in the avocado-growing areas of the Colombian Caribbean. The correlative maximum entropy-based model (MaxEnt) algorithm was used to assess the potential distribution of ABDW in the Caribbean South America. The MaxEnt model predicted locations with potential distribution for ABDW disease in tropical dry forest biomes of Colombia and Venezuela. The largest producing avocado areas in these locations are Serrania de Perija (Colombia) and Serrania de Merida (Venezuela). Field reports from these locations confirm the presence of avocado trees with symptoms of wilting and branch dieback in association with ambrosia beetles. Isothermality, mean diurnal range in temperature and precipitation of the wettest month were the variables with the highest contribution and importance to the spatial distribution model of ABDW disease. A potential distribution map of the ABDW disease for the Caribbean South America was proposed together with an explanatory hypothesis for disease occurrence.

TI  - The Geographical Distribution and Influencing Factors of COVID-19 in China
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE
AB  - The study of the spatial differentiation of COVID-19 in cities and its driving mechanism is helpful to reveal the spatial distribution pattern, transmission mechanism and diffusion model, and evolution mechanism of the epidemic and can lay the foundation for constructing the spatial dynamics model of the epidemic and provide theoretical basis for the policy design, spatial planning and implementation of epidemic prevention and control and social governance. Geodetector (Origin version, Beijing, China) is a great tool for analysis of spatial differentiation and its influencing factors, and it provides decision support for differentiated policy design and its implementation in executing the city-specific policies. Using factor detection and interaction analysis of Geodetector, 15 indicators of economic, social, ecological, and environmental dimensions were integrated, and 143 cities were selected for the empirical research in China. The research shows that, first of all, risks of both infection and death show positive spatial autocorrelation, but the geographical distribution of local spatial autocorrelation differs significantly between the two. Secondly, the inequalities in urban economic, social, and residential environments interact with COVID-19 spatial heterogeneity, with stronger explanatory power especially when multidimensional inequalities are superimposed. Thirdly, the spatial distribution and spread of COVID-19 are highly spatially heterogeneous and correlated due to the complex influence of multiple factors, with factors such as Area of Urban Construction Land, GDP, Industrial Smoke and Dust Emission, and Expenditure having the strongest influence, the factors such as Area of Green, Number of Hospital Beds and Parks, and Industrial NOx Emissions having unignorable influence, while the factors such as Number of Free Parks and Industrial Enterprises, Per-GDP, and Population Density play an indirect role mainly by means of interaction. Fourthly, the factor interaction effect from the infected person's perspective mainly shows a nonlinear enhancement effect, that is, the joint influence of the two factors is greater than the sum of their direct influences; but from the perspective of the dead, it mainly shows a two-factor enhancement effect, that is, the joint influence of the two factors is greater than the maximum of their direct influences but less than their sum. Fifthly, some suggestions are put forward from the perspectives of building a healthy, resilient, safe, and smart city, providing valuable reference and decision basis for city governments to carry out differentiated policy design.

TI  - A dengue outbreak in a rural community in Northern Coastal Ecuador: An analysis using unmanned aerial vehicle mapping
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Dengue is recognized as a major health issue in large urban tropical cities but is also observed in rural areas. In these environments, physical characteristics of the landscape and sociodemographic factors may influence vector populations at small geographic scales, while prior immunity to the four dengue virus serotypes affects incidence. In 2019, a rural northwestern Ecuadorian community, only accessible by river, experienced a dengue outbreak. The village is 2-3 hours by boat away from the nearest population center and comprises both Afro-Ecuadorian and Indigenous Chachi households. We used multiple data streams to examine spatial risk factors associated with this outbreak, combining maps collected with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), an entomological survey, a community census, and active surveillance of febrile cases. We mapped visible water containers seen in UAV images and calculated both the green-red vegetation index (GRVI) and household proximity to public spaces like schools and meeting areas. To identify risk factors for symptomatic dengue infection, we used mixed-effect logistic regression models to account for the clustering of symptomatic cases within households. We identified 55 dengue cases (9.5% of the population) from 37 households. Cases peaked in June and continued through October. Rural spatial organization helped to explain disease risk. Afro-Ecuadorian (versus Indigenous) households experience more symptomatic dengue (OR = 3.0, 95%CI: 1.3, 6.9). This association was explained by differences in vegetation (measured by GRVI) near the household (OR: 11.3 95% 0.38, 38.0) and proximity to the football field (OR: 13.9, 95% 4.0, 48.4). The integration of UAV mapping with other data streams adds to our understanding of these dynamics.

TI  - How does onchocerciasis-related skin and eye disease in Africa depend on cumulative exposure to infection and mass treatment?
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background Onchocerciasis (river-blindness) in Africa is targeted for elimination through mass drug administration (MDA) with ivermectin. Onchocerciasis may cause various types of skin and eye disease. Predicting the impact of MDA on onchocercal morbidity is useful for future policy development. Here, we introduce a new disease module within the established ONCHOSIM model to predict trends over time in prevalence of onchocercal morbidity.
   Methods We developed novel generic model concepts for development of symptoms due to cumulative exposure to dead microfilariae, accommodating both reversible (acute) and irreversible (chronic) symptoms. The model was calibrated to reproduce pre-control age patterns and associations between prevalences of infection, eye disease, and various types of skin disease as observed in a large set of population-based studies. We then used the new disease module to predict the impact of MDA on morbidity prevalence over a 30-year time frame for various scenarios.
   Results ONCHOSIM reproduced observed age-patterns in disease and community-level associations between infection and disease reasonably well. For highly endemic settings with 30 years of annual MDA at 60% coverage, the model predicted a 70% to 89% reduction in prevalence of chronic morbidity. This relative decline was similar with higher MDA coverage and only somewhat higher for settings with lower pre-control endemicity. The decline in prevalence was lowest for mild depigmentation and visual impairment. The prevalence of acute clinical manifestations (severe itch, reactive skin disease) declined by 95% to 100% after 30 years of annual MDA, regardless of pre-control endemicity.
   Conclusion We present generic model concepts for predicting trends in acute and chronic symptoms due to history of exposure to parasitic worm infections, and apply this to onchocerciasis. Our predictions suggest that onchocercal morbidity, in particular chronic manifestations, will remain a public health concern in many epidemiological settings in Africa, even after 30 years of MDA.
   Author summary Onchocerciasis, also known as river blindness, is the second most common infectious cause of blindness worldwide, but also leads to serious skin conditions. Large-scale interventions are ongoing to control and eliminate the disease in Africa, yet the impact of these interventions on onchocercal morbidity is largely unknown. Here, we predict the trends in a wide spectrum of skin and eye disease due to onchocerciasis after up to 30 years of annual mass drug administration (MDA) with ivermectin. To this end, we have developed a novel disease framework within the established ONCHOSIM model. We show that annual MDA will rapidly reduce the prevalence of acute clinical conditions, whereas the prevalence of chronic clinical manifestations will decline much more slowly. The new disease framework was validated with several data sources and reproduced morbidity trends adequately, making the framework applicable for more refined disease prevalence predictions by taking account of treatment history in Africa. Such predictions are essential for accurate estimates of disability-adjusted life years lost due to onchocerciasis by 2025.

TI  - Specialization of a fungal pathogen on host tree species in a cross-inoculation experiment
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
AB  - 1. In forest communities, the Janzen-Connell (J-C) model proposes that species diversity is maintained by noncompetitive distance-or density-dependent seedling mortality caused by host-specific natural enemies. Host specificity, however, has not been fully elucidated.
   2. We conducted a cross-inoculation experiment to evaluate the host specificity of a pathogenic fungus, Colletotrichum anthrisci. The fungus was isolated from seedlings of four tree species (Prunus grayana, Fraxinus lanuginosa, Cornus controversa and Magnolia obovata), all of which were killed by damping-off disease beneath conspecific adults. Each fungal isolate was then inoculated into seedlings of P. grayana and F. lanuginosa. Molecular identification [internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences] also confirmed that all isolates (strains) showed 99-100% similarity with C. anthrisci, irrespective of their origin.
   3. In both P. grayana and F. lanuginosa seedlings, all isolates of the pathogen caused damage, irrespective of origin, but the damage was more severe with the isolate from conspecifics rather than from any of the three heterospecifics.
   4. In response to infection, callose papillae were deposited on the inner side of the leaf cell wall of seedlings in P. grayana; then, circular abscission layers formed between two layers of leaf cells surrounding the locus of infection. The central area of the infection was completely cut off from the rest of the leaf. In F. lanuginosa, infected leaves of seedlings were shed immediately after inoculation. This defensive behaviour, which may prevent further pathogen invasion, was more frequent in seedlings inoculated with isolates from conspecifics than from heterospecifics in both species.
   5. Synthesis. Although the pathogenic fungus C. anthrisci is ubiquitous and attacks a wide range of host species, virulence was much stronger for strains derived from conspecifics rather than from heterospecifics, suggesting local adaptation and development of host specificity. If host specificity is common for several pathogens within a microbial community in a given area occupied by an adult, and the trait is also common for multiple tree species co-occurring within a forest community, the J-C model would be applicable to explain tree species diversity.

TI  - Spatial patterns of Lyme disease risk in California based on disease incidence data and modeling of vector-tick exposure
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Ixodes pacificus, particularly the nymphal life stage, is the primary vector to humans of the Lyme disease agent Borrelia burgdorferi in California. During 2004, we collected I. pacificus nymphs from 78 woodland sites in ecologically diverse Mendocino County, which has a moderately high incidence of Lyme disease. Within this county, nymphal density was elevated in forested areas with a growing degree day range of 2,600-3,000 (10 degrees C base). Using a geographic information systems approach, we identified all areas in California sharing these environmental characteristics and thus projected to pose high acarologic risk of exposure to host-seeking nymphal ticks. Such areas were most commonly detected in the northwestern part of the state and along the Sierra Nevada foothills in the northeast, but the analysis also identified isolated areas with high acarologic risk in southern California. This mirrors the spatial distribution of endemic Lyme disease during 1993-2005; most cases occurred in counties to the northwest (58%) or northeast (26%), whereas fewer cases were reported from southern California (16%). Southern zip-codes from which Lyme disease cases had been reported were commonly located in close proximity to areas with high projected acarologic risk. Overall, Lyme disease incidence in zip code areas containing habitat with high projected acarologic risk was 10-fold higher than in zip code areas lacking such habitat and 27 times higher than for zip code areas without this habitat type within 50 km. A comparison of spatial Lyme disease incidence patterns based on county versus zip code units showed that calculating and displaying disease incidence at the zip code scale is a useful method to detect small, isolated areas with elevated disease risk that otherwise may go undetected.

TI  - The 250 m global land cover change product from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer of NASA's Earth Observing System
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
AB  - One of the products to be derived from data acquired by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Earth Observing System (EOS) will identify locations where land cover changes attributable to human activities are occurring. The product aims to serve as an alarm where rapid land cover conversion can subsequently be analysed with higher resolution sensors such as Landsat 7. This paper describes the production procedure and change detection algorithms for the 250 m MODIS land cover change product. Multiple change detection algorithms, including three spectral methods and two texture methods, are utilized to generate the product from the two 250 m MODIS bands. The change detection methods are implemented with look-up tables (LUTs) which are initially generated using data from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) until MODIS data become available. The results from the five methods are combined to improve confidence in the product. We test the performance of each method against several sets of simulated MODIS data derived from Landsat TM image pairs. The test data represent tropical deforestation, agricultural expansion and urbanization. The commission errors of the five methods and the combination are approximately 10%, with reasonable omission errors less than 25%.

TI  - Malaria and dengue vector biology and control in West and Central Africa
T2  - BRIDGING LABORATORY AND FIELD RESEARCH FOR GENETIC CONTROL OF DISEASE VECTORS
CP  - Conference on Bridging Laboratory and Field Research for Genetic Control of Disease Vectors
AB  - In West and Central Africa endemic malaria and epidemic yellow fever are still main causes of morbidity and mortality. From Dakar in Senegal to Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of Congo the pattern of malaria transmission shows a huge variability, in term of dynamics (rhythm and intensity) of transmission, as well as in terms of the vector species involved. The Plasmodium annual entomological inoculation rates (EIR) vary from less than one to more than 1000 infectious bites per person and P. falciparum represents more than 90% of malaria infections. In most settings south of the Sahara, several vector species are sympatrically involved in malaria transmission either simultaneously or replacing each other seasonally (Coluzzi 1984; Fontenille and Simard 2004). These vectors differ greatly in terms of density and vector efficiency.
   Despite an efficient vaccine, deadly outbreaks of Yellow Fever (YF) virus, which circulates among monkeys and sylvatic vectors, still occur occasionally from Cameroon to Senegal (Mutebi and Barrett 2002). Although Aedes aegypti, the local vector, is abundant, and Dengue 2 virus is present in the forest, human dengue remains very rare and localized in Western Africa. But the situation could worsen with the recent introduction and spreading of Ae. albopictus, a potential dengue vector, in Central Africa.
   Any vector control strategy, whether based on traditional (insecticides and impregnated/treated nets) or genetic control strategies (sterile-male releases or introduction of transgenic mosquitoes), aiming at significantly reducing malaria burden or yellow fever/dengue occurrence in Africa, will have to account for such entomological heterogeneity added to ecological and socio-economic diversities.
   This paper provides an update on the bionomics and genetics of the four major African malaria vector systems (the Anopheles gambiae complex and the An. funestus, An. nili and An. moucheti species groups) and of the Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus species. It also reviews current vector control measures against malaria and yellow-fever vectors.

TI  - The effects of temperature and shading on mortality and development rates of <i>Aedes aegypti</i> (Diptera: Culicidae)
T2  - JOURNAL OF VECTOR ECOLOGY
AB  - Urbanization has caused an increase in favorable habitats for Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae), given their ability to reproduce in small and often non-degradable artificial water-containers. While much work has been done on Ae. aegypti biology and ecology in urban landscapes, the role of shading on immature stages as an independent factor from temperature, and any possible interactions between these factors, remains unexamined. We assessed how temperature and shading affected egg hatch-rate, larval/pupal mortality, and larval development to adult stage under different factorial temperature (28; 31; 34; 37; 40 degrees C) and shade (0%, 3,100 lux; 40%, 1,860 lux; 75%, 775 lux; 100%, 0 lux) regimes. Hatch-rate was significantly lower at 37 degrees C (57 %), and no eggs hatched at 40 degrees C. There was no significant effect caused by shading on hatchability. Larval and pupal mortality at 37 degrees C was significantly higher (35%) compared to lower temperature groups, while the effects of shading were emergent at low temperatures. Developmental times from hatching to adult emergence were significantly reduced with increasing temperatures and with greater light exposures. The eco-physiological response of Ae. aegypti larvae to temperature and light regimes suggest a photosensitivity previously unstudied in this species.

TI  - Environmental Refuge from Disease-Driven Amphibian Extinction
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
AB  - Species that are tolerant of broad environmental gradients may be less vulnerable to epizootic outbreaks of disease. Chytridriomycosis, caused by the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, has been linked to extirpations and extinctions of amphibian species in many regions. The pathogen thrives in cool, moist environments, and high amphibian mortality rates have commonly occurred during chytridiomycosis outbreaks in amphibian populations in high-elevation tropical rainforests. In Australia several high-elevation species, including the armored mist frog (Litoria lorica), which is designated as critically endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), were believed to have gone extinct during chytridiomycosis outbreaks in the 1980s and early 1990s. Species with greater elevational ranges disappeared from higher elevations, but remained common in the lowlands. In June 2008, we surveyed a stream in a high-elevation dry sclerophyll forest and discovered a previously unknown population of L. lorica and a population of the waterfall frog (Litoria nannotis). We conducted 6 additional surveys in June 2008, September 2008, March 2009, and August 2009. Prevalences of B. dendrobatidis infection (number infected per total sampled) were consistently high in frogs (mean 82.5%, minimum 69%) of both species and in tadpoles (100%) during both winter (starting July) and summer (starting February). However, no individuals of either species showed clinical signs of disease, and they remained abundant (3.25 - 8.75 individuals of L. lorica and 6.5-12.5 individuals of L. nannotis found/person/100 m over 13 months). The high-elevation dry sclerophyll site had little canopy cover, low annual precipitation, and a more defined dry season than a nearby rainforest site, where L. nannotis was more negatively affected by chytridiomycosis. We hypothesize this lack of canopy cover allowed the rocks on which frogs perched to warm up, thereby slowing growth and reproduction of the pathogen on the hosts. In addition, we suggest surveys for apparently extinct or rare species should not be limited to core environments.

TI  - Ocular manifestations of monkeypox: a case report
T2  - ARQUIVOS BRASILEIROS DE OFTALMOLOGIA
AB  - Monkeypox disease is a viral zoonosis with symptoms similar to those seen in the past in smallpox (variola), although clinically less severe. Following the eradication of smallpox in 1980 and the subsequent cessation of smallpox vaccination, monkeypox has emerged as the most important orthopoxvirus from a public health standpoint. Monkeypox virus occurs primarily in central and western Africa, often in tropical forests, and has increasingly manifested in urban areas. Animal hosts include various rodents and nonhuman primates. We report the case of a patient with monkeypox disease who developed ocular complaints (eye discomfort and conjunctivitis) and had detectable conjunctival lesions on biomicroscopy and fluorescein testing. Its ophthalmological manifestations are still poorly known.

TI  - Habitat and Season Drive Chigger Mite Diversity and Abundance on Small Mammals in Peninsular Malaysia
T2  - PATHOGENS
AB  - Chigger mites are vectors of the bacterial disease scrub typhus, caused by Orientia spp. The bacterium is vertically transmitted in the vector and horizontally transmitted to terrestrial vertebrates (primarily wild small mammals), with humans as incidental hosts. Previous studies have shown that the size of the chigger populations is correlated with the density of small mammals in scrub typhus-endemic regions. Here, we explore interactions between the small mammals and chiggers in two oil palm plantations located in the Perak and Johor states of Peninsular Malaysia. The location in Perak also contained an aboriginal (Orang Asli) settlement. A similar to 5% sub-sample from 40,736 chigger specimens was identified from five species of small mammals (n = 217), revealing 14 chigger species, including two new records for Malaysia. The abundance and species richness of chiggers were significantly affected by habitat type (highest in forest border), state (highest in Perak), and season (highest in dry). The overall prevalence of Orientia tsutsugamushi DNA in small-mammal tissues was 11.7% and was not significantly affected by host or habitat characteristics, but in Johor, was positively associated with infestation by Leptotrombidium arenicola. These findings highlight the risk of contracting scrub typhus in oil palm plantations and associated human settlements.

TI  - Food web connections and the transmission cycles of <i>Trypanosoma cruzi</i> and <i>Trypanosoma evansi</i> (Kinetoplastida, Trypanosomatidae) in the Pantanal Region, Brazil
T2  - TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - We examined by parasitological tests (hemocultures and buffy coat) infection by Trypanosoma cruzi and T. evansi in blood samples from Leopardus pardalis. Cerdocyon thous and domestic dogs. Besides, 25 T. cruzi isolates previously derived from feral pigs and small wild mammals were here characterized by miniexon gene and demonstrated to be in the TeI genotype. Herein, we make an overall analysis of the transmission cycle of both trypanosome species in the light of the assemblage of data collected over the last seven years. The carnivore Nasua nasua was confirmed to play a major role in the transmission cycles of both T. cruzi and T. evansi since it was the species that had the higher prevalence and higher parasitemias by both flagellate species. In addition, our results show that both trypanosomatid species may be found throughout the Pantanal landscape, in all forest strata, as shown by the infection of carnivore, arboreal and terrestrial scansorial marsupial species in complex and seasonal transmission cycles. We propose that transmission of T. cruzi and T. evansi in the southern Pantanal region takes place via an intricate ecological trophic network involving generalist and specialist mammal species that are linked through a robust food-web connection.

TI  - Tumor apoptosis induced by Ruthenium(II)-ketoconazole is enhanced in nonsusceptible carcinoma by monoclonal antibody to EGF receptor
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CANCER
AB  - Ketoconazole (KTZ) has been used as a second-line agent in hormone-refractory cancer therapy. Since transition metal complexes including those of Ru(III), show important anticancer activity with limited toxicity, we investigated the potential antitumor efficacy of Ru(II) complexed to KTZ or clotrimazole (CTZ) compared to Ru(II) alone or uncomplexed azoles. RuCl2(KTZ)(2) exerted greater apoptosis- associated caspase-3 activation than RuCl2(CTZ)(2), KTZ, CTZ or RuCl2(MeCN)(4) against several human tumor cell monolayers. PARP cleavage and a decrease in S+G(2) cells were evident after RuCl2(KTZ)(2) treatment in genetically matched C8161 melanoma monolayers with unequal p53 functional status. Release of mitochondrial cytochrome c and Mn-SOD suggest mitochondria as a target of RuCl2(KTZ)(2). Treatment of WMI64 melanoma monolayers with 25 muM of cisplatin or RuCl2(KTZ)(2) showed that the latter is more effective than cisplatin at inducing PARP fragmentation and proapoptotic Bak expression. Such results suggest that these Ru(II) and Pt(II) metal complexes are unequally effective and act through alternative signaling pathways. In studies with multicellular spheroids, which frequently are more resistant to cytotoxic anticancer drugs than monolayers, those from wt p53 C8161 melanoma underwent PARP fragmentation in response to RuCl2(KTZ)(2). In contrast, spheroids of mut p53 A431 carcinoma overexpressing EGF receptor were resistant to either RuCl2(KTZ)(2) or anti-EGF receptor C225 MAb. However, joint treatment with both agents restored growth arrest and apoptosis in these spheroids. In contrast to the antitumor action of cisplatin, which is known to be hampered by p53 dysfunction, we show that RuCl2(KTZ)(2) is active irrespective of p53 functional status against several adherent tumor cells and synergizes with anti-EGF receptor C225 MAb to kill tumor spheroids resistant to either agent.

TI  - Precarity at the Margins of Malaria Control in the Chittagong Hill Tracts in Bangladesh: A Mixed-Methods Study
T2  - PATHOGENS
AB  - Bangladesh has achieved significant progress towards malaria elimination, although health service delivery for malaria remains challenging in remote forested areas such as the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT). The aim of this study was to investigate perceptions of malaria and its treatment among the local population to inform contextualized strategies for rolling out radical cure for P. vivax in Bangladesh. The study comprised two sequential strands whereby the preliminary results of a qualitative strand informed the development of a structured survey questionnaire used in the quantitative strand. Results show that ethnic minority populations in the CHT live in precarious socio-economic conditions which increase their exposure to infectious diseases, and that febrile patients often self-treat, including home remedies and pharmaceuticals, before attending a healthcare facility. Perceived low quality of care and lack of communication between Bengali health providers and ethnic minority patients also affects access to public healthcare. Malaria is viewed as a condition that affects vulnerable people weakened by agricultural work and taking away blood is perceived to increase such vulnerability. Healthcare providers that initiate and sustain a dialogue about these issues with ethnic minority patients may foster the trust that is needed for local malaria elimination efforts.

TI  - Status of forest onchocerciasis in the Lower Cross River basin, Nigeria: Entomologic profile after five years of ivermectin intervention
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - In the Lower Cross River basin in Nigeria, no pre-control entomologic profile of Onchocerca volvulus infection in the local Simulium damnosum population was available prior to the initiation of an ivermectin control program in 1995. A longitudinal entomologic study was therefore carried out over a 12-month period (January-December 2001) at the Agbokim waterfalls and Afi River, which are breeding sites of S. damnosum in the river basin. A total of 9,287 adult S. damnosum were caught on human bait; 9,048 (97.43%) were dissected, of which 313 (3.46%) were infected. Annual biting rates (ABRs) of 42,419 and 28,346 bites per persons per year were recorded at the Agbokim Waterfalls and Afi River, respectively. The annual transmission potential (ATP) was 419 infective larvae per person per year at the Agbokim Waterfalls and 427 at the Afi River. Monthly biting rate and monthly transmission potential varied significantly (P < 0.05) at the two sites. Transmission was highly seasonal from April to September, corresponding to the peak biting period of the vector. The high ATP and ABR values are a measure of the mesoendemicity of onchocerciasis in the river basin. There was a significant F-o,05 (1, 10) (P < 0.05) variation in the relative fly abundance from both sites. It was observed that human activities such as farming, fishing, timber cutting, and hunting are done in the early morning and late afternoon, which corresponds to the peak diurnal biting period of the vector. Changes in these practices and attitudes may markedly affect the disease intensity and transmission.

TI  - AMERICAN CUTANEOUS LEISHMANIASIS IN UNITED-STATES TRAVELERS
T2  - ANNALS OF INTERNAL MEDICINE
AB  - Objective: To characterize the exposures and practices of U.S. travelers who acquired cutaneous leishmaniasis in the Americas and to highlight problems they encountered in seeking medical care from U.S. physicians.
   Design: A retrospective review of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Drug Service records and a telephone survey of patients.
   Patients: Fifty-nine civilian U.S. travelers with American cutaneous leishmaniasis for whom the Drug Service released sodium stibogluconate between 1 January 1985 and 30 April 1990; 58 travelers (98%) were interviewed.
   Main Measurements: Travel destination, exposure duration, knowledge about leishmaniasis, and time from noticing skin lesions to release of drug.
   Results: Overall, travelers acquired leishmaniasis in as many as 14 countries; 33 of 59 travelers (56%) were infected in Mexico or Central America. Twenty-seven travelers (46%) were conducting field studies and 23 (39%) were tourists, visitors, or tour guides. At least 15 persons (26% of the 58 interviewed travelers) were in forested areas for 1 week or less; at least 6 of these persons had a maximum exposure of 2 days. Ten persons (17%) were home at least 1 month before they noticed skin lesions. Patients consulted from one to seven physicians (mean, 2.1 physicians) before leishmaniasis was diagnosed. Overall, the median time from noticing lesions to the release of drug was 112 days (range, 13 to 1022 days); however, the median was only 55 days for 13 patients (22%) unusually knowledgeable about leishmaniasis and was a maximum of 60 days for 16 patients (28%) (including 7 of the 13 unusually knowledgeable patients) who generally consulted physicians exceptionally knowledgeable about infectious and tropical diseases.
   Conclusions: Travelers to forested areas in Central America and Texas and their physicians need to be educated about the risk for acquiring leishmaniasis even during short stays; effective preventive measures; and appropriate medical management.

TI  - Transmission dynamics of Monkeypox virus: a mathematical modelling approach
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Monkeypox (MPX), similar to both smallpox and cowpox, is caused by the monkeypox virus (MPXV). It occurs mostly in remote Central and West African communities, close to tropical rain forests. It is caused by the monkeypox virus in the Poxviridae family, which belongs to the genus Orthopoxvirus. We develop and analyse a deterministic mathematical model for the monkeypox virus. Both local and global asymptotic stability conditions for disease-free and endemic equilibria are determined. It is shown that the model undergo backward bifurcation, where the locally stable disease-free equilibrium co-exists with an endemic equilibrium. Furthermore, we determine conditions under which the disease-free equilibrium of the model is globally asymptotically stable. Finally, numerical simulations to demonstrate our findings and brief discussions are provided. The findings indicate that isolation of infected individuals in the human population helps to reduce disease transmission.

TI  - Phlebotomine sandflies (Diptera: Psychodidae) of the Atlantic forest in Recife, Pernambuco state, Brazil:: the species coming to human bait, and their seasonal and monthly variations over a 2-year period
T2  - ANNALS OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND PARASITOLOGY
AB  - In a study of the phlebotomine sandflies (Diptera: Psychodidae) in a forest reserve in Recife, Pernambuco state, north-eastern Brazil, the sandflies landing on human bait between 1.00 and 1.42 h after sunset were collected weekly for 2 years. Although 10,287 sandflies of 10 Lutzomyia species were collected, almost all (96.5%) of the sandflies caught were Lu. umbratilis. This species and several others caught are potential vectors of some of the Leishmania parasites that cause human disease. The recorded landing rate for Lu. umbratilis peaked, at the high level of 333.3 flies/person-hour, during the collections made in May 2003.
   The relative rarity in the collections of males of some of the species caught probably indicates that these species do not lek on their bloodmeal sources.
   It is likely that the sizes of the local populations of species that are not very anthrophilic, such as Lu. flaviscutellata, are much larger than indicated by the collections made on human bait.

TI  - Mathematical analysis and dynamical transmission of monkeypox virus model with fractional operator
T2  - EXPERT SYSTEMS
AB  - Monkeypox virus is one of the major causes of both smallpox and cowpox infection in our society. It is typically located next to tropical rain forests in remote villages in Central and West Africa. The disease is brought on by the monkeypox virus, a member of the Orthopoxvirus genus and the Poxviridae family. For analysis and the dynamical behaviour of the monkeypox virus infection, we developed a fractional order model with the Mittag-Leffler kernel. The uniqueness, positivity, and boundedness of the model are treated with fixed point theory results. A Lyapunov function is used to construct both local and global asymptotic stability of the system for both endemic and disease-free equilibrium points. Finally, numerical simulations are carried out using the effective numerical scheme with an extended Mittag-Leffler function to demonstrate the accuracy of the suggested approaches.

TI  - Identifying correlates of Guinea worm (<i>Dracunculus medinensis</i>) infection in domestic dog populations
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Author summary The eradication of human infectious diseases has proven remarkably difficult. The world has only succeeded once, in the case of the smallpox virus. However, international efforts have driven the debilitating Guinea worm parasite closer to the brink of eradication than nearly any other parasite. Coordinated efforts by the Ministries of Health in endemic countries, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, The Carter Center, and the World Health Organization have reduced the number of annual Guinea worm cases from millions in the 1980s to hundreds in the early 2010s, but recently a new threat has emerged. Guinea worm infections have been diagnosed in domestic dogs, particularly in the Republic of Chad, and numbers of infections have continued to increase. As in many countries where dracunculiasis is endemic, the campaign for eradication in Chad has focused intervention measures on interrupting transmission among humans, so infection in dogs jeopardizes eradication efforts. In this study, we used machine learning methods to identify demographic, geographic, and climatic factors associated with the presence of Guinea worm-infected dogs at the village level, and spatial clustering of dog cases regionally. A combination of demographic, geographic and climatic factors were important correlates of infection at the village level, but the importance of these factors varied between northern and southern populations of the parasite. At the larger village cluster level, the geographic position and climate of a village were most important. Some of our findings, including the importance of fishing villages and the difference in correlates between northern and southern villages can be used by researchers to guide additional data collection and by public health workers to better target eradication efforts. More generally, this work contributes to a broader understanding of the spatial patterning of multi-host infectious diseases of humans and animals.
   Few human infectious diseases have been driven as close to eradication as dracunculiasis, caused by the Guinea worm parasite (Dracunculus medinensis). The number of human cases of Guinea worm decreased from an estimated 3.5 million in 1986 to mere hundreds by the 2010s. In Chad, domestic dogs were diagnosed with Guinea worm for the first time in 2012, and the numbers of infected dogs have increased annually. The presence of the parasite in a non-human host now challenges efforts to eradicateD.medinensis, making it critical to understand the factors that correlate with infection in dogs. In this study, we evaluated anthropogenic and environmental factors most predictive of detection ofD.medinensisinfection in domestic dog populations in Chad. Using boosted regression tree models to identify covariates of importance for predictingD.medinensisinfection at the village and spatial hotspot levels, while controlling for surveillance intensity, we found that the presence of infection in a village was predicted by a combination of demographic (e.g. fishing village identity, dog population size), geographic (e.g. local variation in elevation), and climatic (e.g. precipitation and temperature) factors, which differed between northern and southern villages. In contrast, the presence of a village in a spatial infection hotspot, was primarily predicted by geography and climate. Our findings suggest that factors intrinsic to individual villages are highly predictive of the detection of Guinea worm parasite presence, whereas village membership in a spatial infection hotspot is largely determined by location and climate. This study provides new insight into the landscape-scale epidemiology of a debilitating parasite and can be used to more effectively target ongoing research and possibly eradication and control efforts.

TI  - An Integrative Explainable Artificial Intelligence Approach to Analyze Fine-Scale Land-Cover and Land-Use Factors Associated with Spatial Distributions of Place of Residence of Reported Dengue Cases
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE
AB  - Dengue fever is a prevalent mosquito-borne disease that burdens communities in subtropical and tropical regions. Dengue transmission is ecologically complex; several environmental conditions are critical for the spatial and temporal distribution of dengue. Interannual variability and spatial distribution of dengue transmission are well-studied; however, the effects of land cover and use are yet to be investigated. Therefore, we applied an explainable artificial intelligence (AI) approach to integrate the EXtreme Gradient Boosting and Shapley Additive Explanation (SHAP) methods to evaluate spatial patterns of the residences of reported dengue cases based on various fine-scale land-cover land-use types, Shannon's diversity index, and household density in Kaohsiung City, Taiwan, between 2014 and 2015. We found that the proportions of general roads and residential areas play essential roles in dengue case residences with nonlinear patterns. Agriculture-related features were negatively associated with dengue incidence. Additionally, Shannon's diversity index showed a U-shaped relationship with dengue infection, and SHAP dependence plots showed different relationships between various land-use types and dengue incidence. Finally, landscape-based prediction maps were generated from the best-fit model and highlighted high-risk zones within the metropolitan region. The explainable AI approach delineated precise associations between spatial patterns of the residences of dengue cases and diverse land-use characteristics. This information is beneficial for resource allocation and control strategy modification.

TI  - Shellfish subsidies along the Pacific coast of North America
T2  - ECOGRAPHY
AB  - Spatial subsidies are associated with pronounced ecosystem responses, as nutrients cross ecological boundaries and cascade through food webs. While the importance of subsidies is known, the role of shellfish, specifically molluscs, as a marine subsidy has not been formally described. Focusing primarily on the Pacific coast of North America, we identify vectors that transport shellfish-derived nutrients into coastal terrestrial environments, including birds, mammals, and over 13 000 yr of marine resource use by people. Evidence from recipient ecosystems suggests shellfish drastically influence soil chemistry, forest productivity and the diversity of primary producers at the regional and landscape level. Responses in higher trophic levels have not yet been investigated, but given documented responses in lower trophic levels, this may be due to a lack of examination. To determine if the processes we describe within the northeast Pacific are pertinent to coastal environments worldwide, we also explore shellfish subsidies globally, with a specific focus on temperate and tropical islands. As shellfish are not as spatially or temporally constrained as other subsidies, our examination suggests our findings are applicable to many other geographical regions along the marine-terrestrial interface.

TI  - High prevalence of IgG antibodies to Ebola virus in the Efe pygmy population in the Watsa region, Democratic Republic of the Congo
T2  - BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB  - Background: Factors related to the natural transmission of Ebola virus (EBOV) to humans are still not well defined. Results of previous sero-prevalence studies suggest that circulation of EBOV in human population is common in sub-Saharan Africa. The Efe pygmies living in Democratic Republic of the Congo are known to be exposed to potential risk factors of EBOV infection such as bush meat hunting, entry into caves, and contact with bats. We studied the pygmy population of Watsa region to determine seroprevalence to EBOV infection and possible risks factors.
   Method: Volunteer participants (N = 300) aged 10 years or above were interviewed about behavior that may constitute risk factors for transmission of EBOV, including exposures to rats, bats, monkeys and entry into caves. Samples of venous blood were collected and tested for IgG antibody against EBOV by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The chi(2)-test and Fisher's exact test were used for the comparison of proportions and the Student's t-test to compare means. The association between age group and anti-EBOV IgG prevalence was analysed by a nonparametric test for trend.
   Results: The prevalence of anti-EBOV IgG was 18.7 % overall and increased significantly with age (p = 0.023). No association was observed with exposure to risk factors (contacts with rats, bats, monkeys, or entry into caves).
   Conclusions: The seroprevalence of IgG antibody to EBOV in pygmies in Watsa region is among the highest ever reported, but it remains unclear which exposures might lead to this high infection rate calling for further ecological and behavioural studies.

TI  - Chagas Disease in Central America: Recent Findings and Current Challenges in Vector Ecology and Control
T2  - CURRENT TROPICAL MEDICINE REPORTS
AB  - Purpose of ReviewIn Central America, most new human Trypanosoma cruzi infections (Chagas disease) are vector-borne, primarily by native vector species. Given the importance of vector control in reducing Chagas disease incidence, here, we provide an updated report on the recent advances and the latest research in vector ecology and control in Central America. Our objective is to present a panorama of the current situation that includes vector control program details, recent public health activities and academic research, and current challenges faced by each country and the region as a whole.Recent FindingsWith the elimination of the introduced species Rhodnius prolixus from the region, the primary vector control challenge is control of native species that move between sylvan and domestic environments, namely Triatoma dimidiata and Rhodnius pallescens. These species cannot be eliminated from domestic/peridomestic settings in a sustainable way using insecticide alone, as residual members of domestic populations and/or sylvatic foci allow the species to persistently reinfest following insecticide application. Implementation of integrated, multidisciplinary methods for native vector species control has yielded promising results. In particular, projects using the Ecohealth method have been scaled up and expanded to endemic areas in multiple countries through partnerships between international stakeholders and ministries of health (MoHs). Additionally, the recent description of two new triatomine bug species that were once classified as T. dimidiata may help to tailor vector control methods to interspecies variations, and the discovery of a dark morph of R. pallescens may provide further insight into vector control in Panama. Finally, associations between deforestation and vector T. cruzi infection and abundance in Panama call attention to associations between human land use change and Chagas disease risk.SummaryThe elimination of R. prolixus contributed to significant reductions in human T. cruzi infection incidence in Central America over the past 20 years, but native vector species still pose a significant public health threat. New methods and collaborations present promising solutions, but sustained partnerships, long-term commitment, and strong regional leadership are required to see them through.

TI  - Deep Learning Segmentation of Satellite Imagery Identifies Aquatic Vegetation Associated with Snail Intermediate Hosts of Schistosomiasis in Senegal, Africa
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Schistosomiasis is a debilitating parasitic disease of poverty that affects more than 200 million people worldwide, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa, and is clearly associated with the construction of dams and water resource management infrastructure in tropical and subtropical areas. Changes to hydrology and salinity linked to water infrastructure development may create conditions favorable to the aquatic vegetation that is suitable habitat for the intermediate snail hosts of schistosome parasites. With thousands of small and large water reservoirs, irrigation canals, and dams developed or under construction in Africa, it is crucial to accurately assess the spatial distribution of high-risk environments that are habitat for freshwater snail intermediate hosts of schistosomiasis in rapidly changing ecosystems. Yet, standard techniques for monitoring snails are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and provide information limited to the small areas that can be manually sampled. Consequently, in low-income countries where schistosomiasis control is most needed, there are formidable challenges to identifying potential transmission hotspots for targeted medical and environmental interventions. In this study, we developed a new framework to map the spatial distribution of suitable snail habitat across large spatial scales in the Senegal River Basin by integrating satellite data, high-definition, low-cost drone imagery, and an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered computer vision technique called semantic segmentation. A deep learning model (U-Net) was built to automatically analyze high-resolution satellite imagery to produce segmentation maps of aquatic vegetation, with a fast and robust generalized prediction that proved more accurate than a more commonly used random forest approach. Accurate and up-to-date knowledge of areas at highest risk for disease transmission can increase the effectiveness of control interventions by targeting habitat of disease-carrying snails. With the deployment of this new framework, local governments or health actors might better target environmental interventions to where and when they are most needed in an integrated effort to reach the goal of schistosomiasis elimination.

TI  - A SURVEY ON THE OCCURRENCE OF PESTS AND DISEASES IN TONGKAT ALI (<i>EURYCOMA LONGIFOLIA</i>) PLANTATIONS IN PENINSULAR MALAYSIA
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL FOREST SCIENCE
AB  - The root of Evrycoma longifoha is widely used as a raw ingiedient in traditional medicine and human health supplement. Commercial interest has led to intensified planting of E. longifolia in Malaysia, which inevitably invites infestation problems from pests and diseases. During a nation-wide survey in Peninsular Malaysia between 2012 and 2013, conducted on 28 plantations of three different planting regimes, several pests and diseases were identified and new ones recorded. A total of five pests (tiger moth larvae, scale insect, Zeuzera stem borer, termite and spider mite) and four diseases (sooty mold leaf disease, algal leaf spot disease. Sudden Death Syndrome and Colletriochum leaf disease) were identified. Infestation by the tiger moth (Atteva sciodoxa) is a new record found in all survey sites. The moth's attack on monoculture E. longifolia plantation was the most destructive as reflected from the severity level (58.3%) measured as Damage Severity Index (DSI), in comparison to polyculture (33.3%) and in existing natural forest growTh (32.7%). Since the last survey in 2011, a number of new pests and diseases have emerged, causing further damage and increase in pest and disease management cost. The study concluded that A. snodoxa is the most severe pest of E. longifolia and planting the tree with other tree species in polyculture is an advantageous approach to curb the infestation.

TI  - Use of long-term stored vector information in the neotropical ant <i>Gigantiops destructor</i>
T2  - JOURNAL OF INSECT BEHAVIOR
AB  - We investigated how the formicine ant Gigantiops destructor can use vector information to navigate within the cluttered environment of the rain forest. Displaced foragers use skylight information to move in the theoretical feeder-to-nest direction, whether they are prevented from updating their path-integrator during foraging or captured at the departure from their nest, i.e. with a current accumulator state very close to zero. Only ants that have collected food are able to download a long-term stored reference vector pointing in the nest direction, irrespective of the current accumulator state of their path-integrator stored in a working memory and independent of familiar landmarks. Depending on the release sites, ants that became lost at a maximum distance of 50 cm could still hit and recognize their familiar route, or they engaged in a systematic search for it centered on the release sites. In contrast to Cataglyphis desert ants, Gigantiops ants do not rely primarily on the current accumulator state of their egocentric path integrator. Such a long-term vector-based navigation primed by food capture is well adapted for a tropical ant foraging during periods spanning several hours. This could prevent the numerous cumulative errors in the evaluation of the angles steered that might result from a continuously running path-integrator operating during complex foraging patterns performed at ground or arboreal levels and during passive displacement in response to heavy rain.

TI  - 'Epidemics in a Mist': Medical Climatology and Cholera in Victorian Visual Culture
T2  - JOURNAL OF VICTORIAN CULTURE
AB  - The article explores how Victorian visual culture was a vital force in the construction and dissemination of medical theories on the connection between climate and health. During the nineteenth century, the seemingly inexplicable and deadly nature of many epidemic diseases compelled British medics to investigate all possible reasons for their spread. Focusing on cholera, the article will examine how, in an effort to understand what was seen at the time as a mysterious disease, Victorian medics increasingly concentrated on the climate of India and unusual weather in Britain as propagators of the malady. Supplementing the dominant miasma theory, medics explained how the seemingly airborne sources of cholera resulted from a state of England's air that resembled the tropical environment of the subcontinent. In an effort to highlight the correlation between cholera and the atmosphere, they produced medical climatology reports containing diagrams that juxtaposed the data on the disease's mortality rates with measurements of meteorological phenomena. These images, rather than serving simply as illustrations, became a crucial part of medical arguments. As the article will demonstrate, in attempting to visualize the medical climatology of cholera, the diagrams mapped the disease to certain atmospheric conditions, suggesting that cholera could be quantified and controlled. Yet, in doing so, the images also implied that cholera had a real material presence in the air of Britain, powerfully evoking visual tropes of the disease as a substance that had the potential to contaminate the very landscape of the nation.

TI  - Modelling and mapping of soil erosion susceptibility using machine learning in a tropical hot sub-humid environment
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - Sobha watershed, located in the Puruliya district of West Bengal, India, is experiencing severe soil erosion due to specific geo-environmental settings and unscientific land practices. It poses serious threats to agricultural and natural resource development, resulting in land degradation and desertification. This study attempts to identify soil erosion susceptible zones (SESZ) of the Sobha watershed by utilising remote sensing and GIS data products in different machine learning algorithms i.e., Support Vector Machine (SVM), Classification and Regression Tree (CART), Boosted Regression Tree (BRT), and Random Forest (RF)) considering sixteen soil erosion controlling factors (SECFs). In addition, the efficiency of the chosen machine learning models was evaluated using known soil erosion and non-erosion data. The results showed that elevation, drainage density (DD), and normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) factors contribute the most to soil erosion. The ROC (receiver operating curve) AUC (area under the curve) is used to compare each model, and it was reveals that the RF model performed and predicted the best among them. However, all the models exhibit an outstanding capacity with AUC > 85% (RF = 0.97, BRT = 0.96, SVM = 0.95, and CART = 0.88). The RF model results show that the Northeastern portion of the catchment (upper part) is most vulnerable to erosion, and about 14.48% of the basin areas are under the severe erosion zone. Thereby, the findings based on machine learning algorithms and intensive field visits are utilised to assess the soil erosion risk zones, and this work will give insight into implementing suitable policies to mitigate this issue. Furthermore, the approaches utilised in this study could be useful in predicting soil erosion risk in other regions as well. In addition, the study has also recommended some appropriate policies and management approaches that would be immensely useful for the local government and policymakers in initiating strategic planning to combat soil erosion.

TI  - Onchocerciasis: The Pre-control Association between Prevalence of Palpable Nodules and Skin Microfilariae
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background: The prospect of eliminating onchocerciasis from Africa by mass treatment with ivermectin has been rejuvenated following recent successes in foci in Mali, Nigeria and Senegal. Elimination prospects depend strongly on local transmission conditions and therefore on pre-control infection levels. Pre-control infection levels in Africa have been mapped largely by means of nodule palpation of adult males, a relatively crude method for detecting infection. We investigated how informative pre-control nodule prevalence data are for estimating the pre-control prevalence of microfilariae (mf) in the skin and discuss implications for assessing elimination prospects.
   Methods and Findings: We analyzed published data on pre-control nodule prevalence in males aged >= 20 years and mf prevalence in the population aged >= 5 years from 148 African villages. A meta-analysis was performed by means of Bayesian hierarchical multivariate logistic regression, accounting for measurement error in mf and nodule prevalence, bioclimatic zones, and other geographical variation. There was a strong positive correlation between nodule prevalence in adult males and mf prevalence in the general population. In the forest-savanna mosaic area, the pattern in nodule and mf prevalence differed significantly from that in the savanna or forest areas.
   Significance: We provide a tool to convert pre-control nodule prevalence in adult males to mf prevalence in the general population, allowing historical data to be interpreted in terms of elimination prospects and disease burden of onchocerciasis. Furthermore, we identified significant geographical variation in mf prevalence and nodule prevalence patterns warranting further investigation of geographical differences in transmission patterns of onchocerciasis.

TI  - Plant Phenology Supports the Multi-emergence Hypothesis for Ebola Spillover Events
T2  - ECOHEALTH
AB  - Ebola virus disease outbreaks in animals (including humans and great apes) start with sporadic host switches from unknown reservoir species. The factors leading to such spillover events are little explored. Filoviridae viruses have a wide range of natural hosts and are unstable once outside hosts. Spillover events, which involve the physical transfer of viral particles across species, could therefore be directly promoted by conditions of host ecology and environment. In this report, we outline a proof of concept that temporal fluctuations of a set of ecological and environmental variables describing the dynamics of the host ecosystem are able to predict such events of Ebola virus spillover to humans and animals. We compiled a data set of climate and plant phenology variables and Ebola virus disease spillovers in humans and animals. We identified critical biotic and abiotic conditions for spillovers via multiple regression and neural network-based time series regression. Phenology variables proved to be overall better predictors than climate variables. African phenology variables are not yet available as a comprehensive online resource. Given the likely importance of phenology for forecasting the likelihood of future Ebola spillover events, our results highlight the need for cost-effective transect surveys to supply phenology data for predictive modelling efforts.

TI  - Potential gains through selecting for resistance in spotted gum to <i>Quambalaria pitereka</i>
T2  - AUSTRALASIAN PLANT PATHOLOGY
AB  - Quambalaria shoot blight, caused by the fungus Quambalaria pitereka, is a serious disease affecting the expanding eucalypt plantation estate in subtropical and tropical eastern Australia. Trees that are severely infected are often multi-stemmed and stunted and infection of young trees may give rise to poor form in mature trees. A spotted gum clonal trial provided the opportunity to investigate the impact of the disease on tree growth and factors influencing tree architecture (tree form), which affects wood quality. We measured the effect that Q. pitereka infection during plantation establishment (up to 6 months old) has on growth and tree architecture and productivity to age 3 years. Our results show that the pathogen has a significant impact on trees at plantation establishment, which results in a negative impact on wood quality, potentially reducing merchantable value at final harvest. Tree growth and form was significantly improved where germplasm with low susceptibility to Q. pitereka infection was used.

TI  - A MODEL OF NEOTROPICAL LAND-USE WITH ENDOGENOUS MALARIA AND PREVENTIVE ECOLOGICAL MEASURES
T2  - ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING A
AB  - Malaria is a serious problem limiting agricultural colonization in the neotropics, especially in the Brazilian Amazon. We analyze a model that links the disease with deforestation and ecological measures to control the mosquito. In the model the probability of contracting malaria increases with population density, which is a principal endogenous variable in land-use decisions. A higher incidence of malaria reduces labor productivity. Farmers maximize profit by allocating labor between cultivation and health activities that reduce the incidence and severity of malaria. Commodity price changes, transportation improvements, and land clearance costs all affect the prevalence of malaria, and health and labor productivity. A reduction in land clearance costs will improve health and labor productivity but will exacerbate deforestation. An increase in the commodity price and a reduction in transportation costs exacerbate deforestation but reduce the prevalence of malaria, although the resultant change in the equilibrium levels of health and labor productivity is ambiguous.

TI  - Ecosystem degradation and the spread of Covid-19
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
AB  - The linkages between the emergence of zoonotic diseases and ecosystem degradation have been widely acknowledged by the scientific community and policy makers. In this paper we investigate the relationship between human overexploitation of natural resources, represented by the Human Appropriation of Net Primary Production Index (HANPP) and the spread of Covid-19 cases during the first pandemic wave in 730 regions of 63 countries worldwide. Using a Bayesian estimation technique, we highlight the significant role of HANPP as a driver of Covid-19 diffusion, besides confirming the well-known impact of population size and the effects of other socio-economic variables. We believe that these findings could be relevant for policy makers in their effort towards a more sustainable intensive agriculture and responsible urbanisation.

TI  - Wetlands, wild Bovidae species richness and sheep density delineate risk of Rift Valley fever outbreaks in the African continent and Arabian Peninsula
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Rift Valley fever (RVF) is an emerging, vector-borne viral zoonosis that has significantly impacted public health, livestock health and production, and food security over the last three decades across large regions of the African continent and the Arabian Peninsula. The potential for expansion of RVF outbreaks within and beyond the range of previous occurrence is unknown. Despite many large national and international epidemics, the landscape epidemiology of RVF remains obscure, particularly with respect to the ecological roles of wildlife reservoirs and surface water features. The current investigation modeled RVF risk throughout Africa and the Arabian Peninsula as a function of a suite of biotic and abiotic landscape features using machine learning methods. Intermittent wetland, wild Bovidae species richness and sheep density were associated with increased landscape suitability to RVF outbreaks. These results suggest the role of wildlife hosts and distinct hydrogeographic landscapes in RVF virus circulation and subsequent outbreaks may be underestimated. These results await validation by studies employing a deeper, field-based interrogation of potential wildlife hosts within high risk taxa.

This new species is placed in the S. asakoae species-group and is characterized by having a combination of the elongate female sensory vesicle, widened male hind basitarsus, which is much wider than the hind femur, small pupal terminal hooks, and light greenish larval abdominal segments 1?3. Taxonomic notes are given to separate this new species from other related species. A DNA analysis using the COI gene shows that this new species has two genoforms with 1.21% difference. This is the 28th species of the S. asakoae speciesgroup in Thailand, strengthening the evidence for high species diversity of this species-group.

TI  - Diversity and host association of the tropical tree endophyte <i>Lasiodiplodia theobromae</i> revealed using simple sequence repeat markers
T2  - FOREST PATHOLOGY
AB  - Lasiodiplodia theobromae is a cosmopolitan fungus with a worldwide distribution in the tropics and subtropics, where it causes shoot blight and dieback of trees and shrubs and imparts blue stain in timber. In this study, eight simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were used to evaluate the genetic diversity and gene flow between populations of L. theobromae. The relationships between isolates from different hosts were considered using three populations from different tree species in Venezuela (VEN) and the relationships between isolates from different geographical origins included populations from VEN, South Africa (RSA) and Mexico (MEX). A small number of predominant genotypes were encountered in the VEN and RSA populations and thus genotypic diversity was low. There was no evidence of host specificity for isolates of L. theobromae and there was very high gene flow between populations from different hosts. Geographical isolation existed between populations of the pathogen from different regions, with unique alleles fixed in the different populations. Gene flow was, however, less restricted between isolates from MEX and the other populations, consistent with MEX as a common source of seed in both VEN and RSA. Genetic analysis suggested predominantly clonal reproduction with some genotypes widely distributed within a region. The broad host range of L. theobromae and the lack of evidence for host specialization, coupled with its endophytic nature and the common appearance of symptoms only after harvest, is likely to hinder disease management strategies.

T2  - BULLETIN DE LA SOCIETE DE PATHOLOGIE EXOTIQUE
AB  - An investigation was conducted between 1994 and 1997 in forested areas of the Central African Republic (CAR) to determine the seroprevalence of IgG antibodies against several haemorrhagic fever viruses present in the region. Sera were obtained from 1762 individuals in two groups (Pygmy and Bantu locuted populations) living in 4 forested areas in the south of the country. Sera were tested for IgG antibodies against Ebola, Marburg, Rift Valley fever (RVF), Yellow fever (YF) and Hantaviruses by enzyme immunoassay (EIA), and against Lassa virus by immunofluorescent assay. The prevalence of IgG antibodies was 5.9% for Ebola, 2% for Marburg, 5.9% pour RVF 6.5% for YF 2% for Hantaan. No antibodies were detected against Lassa, Seoul Puumala and Thottapalayam viruses. No IgM antibodies were detected against RVF and YF viruses. The distribution of antibodies appears to be related to tropical rain forest areas. This study indicates that several haemorrhagic fever viruses are endemic in forested areas of the CAR and could emerge due to environmental modification.

TI  - Pre-control relationship of onchocercal skin disease with onchocercal infection in Guinea Savanna, Northern Nigeria
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   Onchocerca volvulus infection can result in blindness, itching and skin lesions. Previous research concentrated on blindness.
   Methods
   A clinical classification system of the cutaneous changes in onchocerciasis was used for the first time in this study within the context of an early ivermectin drug trial in the savanna region of Kaduna State, northern Nigeria. Skin examinations were performed in 6,790 individuals aged 5+ years in endemic communities and 1,343 individuals in nonendemic communities.
   Results/Discussion
   There was increased risk for all forms of onchocercal skin disease in endemic communities with the most common finding being the presence of nodules (1,438 individuals, 21.2%), followed by atrophy (367, 6.1% of those < 50 years), acute papular onchodermatitis, APOD (233, 3.4%), depigmentation (216, 3.2%) and chronic papular onchodermatitis, CPOD (155, 2.3%). A further 645 individuals (9.5%) complained of pruritus but had completely normal skin. APOD was more common in males whereas atrophy, hanging groin and nodules were more common in females. After controlling for age and sex, microfilarial positivity was a risk factor for CPOD, depigmentation, hanging groin and nodules (OR 1.54, p = 0.046; OR 2.29, p = 0.002; OR 2.18, p = 0.002 and OR 3.80, p < 0.001 respectively). Comparable results were found using presence of nodules as the marker for infection. Microfilarial load showed similar, though weaker, results. A total of 2621(38.6%) endemic residents had itching with normal skin, or had one or more types of onchocercal skin disease including nodules, which may be considered as a composite index of the overall prevalence of onchocercal skin disease.
   Conclusion
   Significant levels of onchocercal skin disease were documented in this savanna area, which subsequently resulted in a reassessment of the true burden of skin disease in onchocerciasis. This paper represents the first detailed report of the association of onchocercal skin disease with markers for onchocercal infection.

TI  - In pursuit of a cure: The plural therapeutic landscape of onchocerciasis-associated epilepsy in Cameroon - A mixed methods study
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background A high prevalence of epilepsy has been observed in several onchocerciasis-endemic villages in the Sanaga River basin, Cameroon. Recent studies suggest that ivermectin, a drug that is distributed annually with the aim of eliminating onchocerciasis, may have a protective effect against acquiring onchocerciasis-associated epilepsy (OAE). This study, therefore, provides an in-depth understanding of both the complex therapeutic landscape for epilepsy as well as the experiences related to the 'community-directed treatment with ivermectin' (CDTI) campaign in order to identify a more trenchant path forward in the fight against epilepsy.
   Methodology/Principal findings Based on a mixed methods study combining a qualitative strand with a quantitative survey, we found that epilepsy was perceived to have had an epidemic emergence in the past and was still considered an important health issue in the study area. Socio-economic status, availability and accessibility of drugs and practitioners, as well as perceived aetiology shaped therapeutic itineraries for epilepsy, which included frequenting (in)formal biomedical health care providers, indigenous and/or faith healing practitioners. Ivermectin uptake for onchocerciasis was generally well known and well regarded. The CDTI faced structural and logistical bottlenecks undermining equal access and optimal adherence to the drug.
   Conclusions/Significance Uninterrupted, sustainable and comprehensive health-service delivery is essential to help alleviate the epilepsy burden on afflicted households. Addressing structural challenges of CDTI and communicating the potential link with epilepsy to local populations at risk could optimize the uptake of this potentially significant tool in OAE prevention.
   Author summary Regions where onchocerciasis-a parasitical infection transmitted by blackflies-is endemic also tend to suffer from high levels of epilepsy. Recent studies suggest that ivermectin, an anti- onchocerciasis drug distributed annually to entire populations in onchocerciasis-endemic regions, may protect against developing onchocerciasis-associated epilepsy (OAE). As the link between onchocerciasis and epilepsy has been poorly understood and scientifically neglected in the past, our mixed methods research investigated how residents in an affected Cameroonian area perceive and cope with epilepsy; how they interpret the (causes of the) illness; where they seek care and why there. Armed with this knowledge, epilepsy control programs can optimize interventions geared at relieving the burden of epilepsy-and potentially OAE-which is essential given the fact that, despite 15-20 years of ivermectin distribution, onchocerciasis transmission persists and epilepsy prevalence in these regions remains high. Our findings illustrate how crucial it is to ensure uninterrupted, sustainable and comprehensive health service delivery for epilepsy. Furthermore, the structural challenges associated with the mass ivermectin distribution campaign must be addressed in order to relieve the burden of onchocerciasis, and potentially OAE. Without first addressing these structural bottlenecks, uptake and adherence to ivermectin treatment will remain insufficient.

TI  - Virome analysis of two sympatric bat species (<i>Desmodus rotundus</i> and <i>Molossus molossus</i>) in French Guiana
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Environmental disturbances in the Neotropics (e.g., deforestation, agriculture intensification, urbanization) contribute to an increasing risk of cross-species transmission of microorganisms and to disease outbreaks due to changing ecosystems of reservoir hosts. Although Amazonia encompasses the greatest diversity of reservoir species, the outsized viral population diversity (virome) has yet to be investigated. Here, through a metagenomic approach, we identified 10,991 viral sequences in the saliva and feces of two bat species, Desmodus rotundus (hematophagous), trapped in two different caves surrounded by primary lowland forest, and Molossus molossus (insectivorous), trapped in forest and urban habitats. These sequences are related to 51 viral families known to infect a wide range of hosts (i.e., bacteria, plants, insects and vertebrates). Most viruses detected reflected the diet of bat species, with a high proportion of plant and insect-related viral families for M. molossus and a high proportion of vertebrate-related viral families for D. rotundus, highlighting its influence in shaping the viral diversity of bats. Lastly, we reconstructed the phylogenetic relationships for five vertebrate-related viral families (Nairoviridae, Circoviridae, Retroviridae, Herpesviridae, Papillomaviridae). The results showed highly supported clustering with other viral sequences of the same viral family hosted by other bat species, highlighting the potential association of viral diversity with the host's diet. These findings provide significant insight into viral bat diversity in French Guiana belonging to the Amazonian biome and emphasize that habitats and the host's dietary ecology may drive the viral diversity in the bat communities investigated.

TI  - Standardising Visual Control Devices for Tsetse Flies: Central and West African Species <i>Glossina palpalis palpalis</i>
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background: Glossina palpalis palpalis (G. p. palpalis) is one of the principal vectors of sleeping sickness and nagana in Africa with a geographical range stretching from Liberia in West Africa to Angola in Central Africa. It inhabits tropical rain forest but has also adapted to urban settlements. We set out to standardize a long-lasting, practical and cost-effective visually attractive device that would induce the strongest landing response by G. p. palpalis for future use as an insecticide-impregnated tool in area-wide population suppression of this fly across its range.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Trials were conducted in wet and dry seasons in the Ivory Coast, Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Angola to measure the performance of traps (biconical, monoconical and pyramidal) and targets of different sizes and colours, with and without chemical baits, at different population densities and under different environmental conditions. Adhesive film was used as a practical enumerator at these remote locations to compare landing efficiencies of devices. Independent of season and country, both phthalogen blue-black and blue-black-blue 1 m 2 targets covered with adhesive film proved to be as good as traps in phthalogen blue or turquoise blue for capturing G. p. palpalis. Trap efficiency varied (8-51%). There was no difference between the performance of blue-black and blue-black-blue 1 m 2 targets. Baiting with chemicals augmented the overall performance of targets relative to traps. Landings on smaller phthalogen blue-black 0.25 m(2) square targets were not significantly different from either 1 m(2) blue-black-blue or blue-black square targets. Three times more flies were captured per unit area on the smaller device.
   Conclusions/Significance: Blue-black 0.25 m(2) cloth targets show promise as simple cost effective devices for management of G. p. palpalis as they can be used for both control when impregnated with insecticide and for population sampling when covered with adhesive film.

TI  - Pathogen attack and spatial patterns of juvenile mortality and growth in a temperate tree, <i>Prunus grayana</i>
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
AB  - To examine whether the Janzen-Connell hypothesis is valid in temperate forests, we investigated the density, growth, mortality, and agents of mortality of seedlings and the density, size, and age of saplings of Prunus grayana Maxim. at three distances (0-3, 6-10, and 16-26 m) from conspecific adults in a temperate forest in Japan. An inoculation experiment was also conducted to test the host range of a leaf pathogen. The probability of mortality was highest at 0-3 m during the first 2 years of growth. Mortality mainly resulted from distance-dependent attack by two types of pathogen that caused damping-off epidemics and spot symptoms on leaves. The leaf pathogen was identified as Phaeoisariopsis pruni-grayanae Sawada, which infected many more seedlings of Prunus grayana than of the two other tree species tested in an inoculation experiment. The vertical and diameter growth was lowest at 0-3 m and highest at 16-26 m in both seedlings and saplings. As a result, the greatest number of large and older saplings was observed at 16-26 m. Our results demonstrate that the Janzen-Connell mechanism operates in a beech-dominated forest in the temperate region of Japan.

TI  - Dietary isoflavones, the modulator of breast carcinogenesis: Current landscape and future perspectives
T2  - ASIAN PACIFIC JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE
AB  - Breast cancer is a frightful disease and serious concern in women around the world causing significant health care burden in both developed and developing countries. Extensive research work has shown that breast cancer provides strong resistance to chemical agents, UV radiation, and hormonal treatments. It is generally accepted that cell genetics is not the only main reason for breast cancer and genetic risk factors, for example, mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes constitute 5%-10% of all breast cancer rates. Other related factors include age, gender, race, ethnicity, weight, reproductive factors, exo- and endogenous hormonal exposures, oral contraceptives use, ultraviolet radiation, diet, and night work (circadian disruption). Many studies have revealed that dietary isoflavones regulate breast cancer occurrence, recurrence and prognosis. Dietary isoflavones have long been part of Asian population diet and there is a significant increase as compared to dietary isoflavones intake among other populations. Dietary isoflavones are natural phytoestrogens having both estrogenic and anti-estrogenic potentials on breast cancer cells in culture, animal models and in experimental trials. This literature survey provides a comprehensive overview on the tumor preventive and tumor promoting potentials of dietary isoflavones on breast cancer. In addition, this paper provides a literature review of dietary isoflavones and their effects on up-regulation and down-regulation of different signaling pathways, genes and proteins. Finally, future perspectives of dietary isoflavones and breast cancer researchers are also critically discussed, which will provide a deeper insight regarding the inner molecular mechanisms of action.

TI  - Agricultural land-use change in Kerala, India: Perspectives from above and below the canopy
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Despite the availability of a wide range of tools, measuring and explaining changes in land cover and land use in tropical regions can be extremely challenging. Kerala, India, is a biodiversity hotspot with a high population density and a long history of complex agricultural land-use patterns. Some reports suggest that agriculture in Kerala, which historically is rice paddy-wetland and agroforestry-based, is on the decline. However, the evidence is often anecdotal, especially with regards to smallholding homegarden agriculture. In this study we employ mixed methods, including remote sensing, quantitative household surveys, and semi-structured interviews, to unravel the complex land-cover and land-use changes occurring in Kerala.
   Results indicate that, from a land-cover change perspective, agroforests are in dynamic equilibrium with other land covers, being cleared for roads and new buildings, but offset by the expansion of younger, less diverse agroforests into paddy wetlands. Yet beneath the canopy, agroforests are undergoing rapid land-use change not discernible using remote sensing. These changes include a reported decrease in the cultivation of 80% of Kerala's primary crop species during 2003-2013, alongside a dramatic decline in chickens (from 12.5 to 2.6 per homestead on average) and cows (from 1.7 to 0.8). Over this period, no crop increased in cultivation. According to farmers, the primary drivers of this shift were declining profitability of agriculture in Kerala, labour shortages, unreliable weather, unfamiliar pests and diseases, and government policy.
   Despite the undeniable move away from agricultural activity in homegardens, we conclude that these ecologically and culturally important systems are not disappearing, but rather evolving to meet the needs of a less agricultural Kerala. Our research highlights the value of using mixed methods for characterizing land-use and land-cover histories in tropical regions.

TI  - Bioactivity of Fungal Endophytes as a Function of Endophyte Taxonomy and the Taxonomy and Distribution of Their Host Plants
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Fungal endophytes - fungi that grow within plant tissues without causing immediate signs of disease - are abundant and diverse producers of bioactive secondary metabolites. Endophytes associated with leaves of tropical plants are an especially exciting and relatively untapped source of novel compounds. However, one major challenge in drug discovery lies in developing strategies to efficiently recover highly bioactive strains. As part of a 15-year drug discovery project, foliar endophytes were isolated from 3198 plant samples (51 orders, 105 families and at least 232 genera of angiosperms and ferns) collected in nine geographically distinct regions of Panama. Extracts from culture supernatants of >2700 isolates were tested for bioactivity (in vitro percent inhibition of growth, % IG) against a human breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) and the causative agents of malaria, leishmaniasis, and Chagas' disease. Overall, 32.7% of endophyte isolates were highly active in at least one bioassay, including representatives of diverse fungal lineages, host lineages, and collection sites. Up to 17% of isolates tested per assay were highly active. Most bioactive strains were active in only one assay. Fungal lineages differed in the incidence and degree of bioactivity, as did fungi from particular plant taxa, and greater bioactivity was observed in endophytes isolated from plants in cloud forests vs. lowland forests. Our results suggest that using host taxonomy and forest type to tailor plant collections, and selecting endophytes from specific orders or families for cultivation, will markedly increase the efficiency and efficacy of discovering bioactive metabolites for particular pharmaceutical targets.

TI  - Mayaro Virus: The Potential Role of Microbiota and <i>Wolbachia</i>
T2  - PATHOGENS
AB  - The Mayaro virus (MAYV) is an arbovirus that circulates mainly in tropical forests or rural areas in Latin America and is transmitted mainly by Haemagogus mosquitoes. The objective of this study was to evaluate the vector competence, microbiome, and the presence of Wolbachia in three Aedes albopictus populations infected with MAYV. The vector competence was assessed based on viral infection and transmission by RT-qPCR. In addition, the microbiome was evaluated by amplification of the 16S rRNA V4 region and PCR to detect the presence of Wolbachia (strain wAlbA/wAlbB). Our results show that all three populations were susceptible to MAYV infection. The potential transmission of the MAYV was consistent in all populations of naive mosquitoes injected (more than 50%). The microbiome analysis revealed 118 OTUs (operational taxonomic unit) from the three populations, 8 phyla, 15 classes, 26 orders, 35 families, 65 genera, and 53 species. All populations had Pseudomonas and Wolbachia as predominant genera. There was no difference between the variables for MAYV and Wolbachia (wAlbA or wAlbB) in the abdomen. However, in the head + thorax samples at 14 dpi, there was a difference between the two populations, indicating a possible correlation between the presence of Wolbachia (wAlbB) and infection. Overall, we show evidence that Ae. albopictus displays significant infection and transmission competence for the MAYV in the laboratory, and its bacterial microbiota play an important role in the host, mainly the strains of Wolbachia. The influence of the intestinal microbiota of Ae. albopictus is poorly known, and a better understanding of these interactions would open new perspectives for disease control through the manipulation of microbial communities. The exact contribution of this mosquito species to the transmission of the MAYV in the field remains to be confirmed.

TI  - Is the domestic dog (<i>Canis familiaris</i>) a reservoir host of American cutaneous leishmaniasis?: A critical review of the current evidence
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Originally associated with forested areas, the transmission cycle of American cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL) has now adapted to the domestic environment in at least 9 Latin American countries. Several studies have suggested that the domestic dog (Canis familiaris), which is already incriminated as the primary reservoir host of zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis (ZVL), may have a reservoir role in the domestic transmission of human ACL caused by Leishmania braziliensis, L. panamensis, and L. peruviana. This article reviews more than 90 studies reporting ACL infections in dogs, and concludes that as yet there is only circumstantial evidence to support chat claim. Almost no data are available on the infectiousness of dogs to sandfly vectors of ACL, and there are few indications that either dog ownership or dog abundance are risk factors for ACL. Nevertheless, it has been proposed that incidence of ACL in humans could be reduced by targeting infected dogs. While this control strategy has been used for many decades against ZVL in Latin America, Europe, and Asia, there is Little evidence to demonstrate its effectiveness either in theory or in practice. Particular concerns over the sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic tools, low compliance rates among dog owners, and cost-effectiveness are likely to apply equally to ACL control.

T2  - JOURNAL OF PARASITOLOGY
AB  - Haemoproteus (Parahaemaproteus) cyanomitrae n. sp. (Haemosporida: Haemoproteidae) was found in the olive sunbird. Cyanomitra olivacea (Nectariniidae), in rain forests of tropical Africa. It is described based on the morphology of its blood stages and a segment of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene (Gen Bank accession FJ404696), which can be used for molecular identification and diagnosis of this species. Fully grown gametocytes of new parasite are similar to many other species of haemoproteids of passeriform birds, so are not easily distinguishable from many of them at this stage of their development. Haemoproteus cyanomitrae can be readily distinguished from the majority of described species of avian haemoproteids, primarily due to its growing dumbbell-shaped gametocytes and advanced halteridial gametocytes, both of which do not touch the envelope of infected erythrocytes along their entire margin. Pigment granules are most frequently clamped in I. or several, groups in gametocytes, with larger group of pigment granules usually located close to one end of the gametocyte; asymmetric position of pigment granules in gametocytes a characteristic feature of this parasite. Illustrations of blood stages of the new species are given, and phylogenetic analysis identifies DNA lineages closely related to this parasite, which is widespread in African rain forests, but has been recorded only in the olive sunbird so far. It is probable that H. cyanomitrae is transmitted throughout the range of the olive sunbird in Africa.

T2  - NEOTROPICAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - The genus Lutzomyia has great importance in the New World, with some species implicated in the transmission of causal agents of leishmaniases, bartonellosis and arboviruses. From April 2003 to June 2004 an investigation was undertaken on the richness and abundance of the sand fly fauna in the northeast area of Manacapuru county, Amazonas State. The captures were carried out, with 16 light traps CDC, in areas of forest known as terra firme along the highway Manuel Urbano. In the period of 13 months we collected a total of 10,446 sandfly specimens, 3,908 males (38%) and 6,465 females (62%), distributed in 43 species belonging to the genus Lutzomyia, 10 subgenera and six species groups. These results evidenced a diversified and abundant sand fly fauna, with some species not yet reported for Manaus county, close to the study area.

TI  - The viruses of Australia and the risk to tourists
T2  - TRAVEL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE
AB  - Australia is a climatically diverse country varying from a tropical climate in the north to arid central desert and grassland regions, and to temperate climates in the south. There are many viral infections found in Australia that are common to developed countries worldwide, but this article will focus on those that pose a special risk for travellers to Australia, especially the mosquito-borne viruses. The commonest are the members of the alphavirus genus, particularly Ross River virus and Barmah Forest virus, which cause predominantly arthralgia with or without fever or rash. Less frequent but more serious illness is seen with the encephalitic flaviviruses, Murray Valley encephalitis virus, and the Kunjin strain of West Nile virus. In addition dengue occurs intermittently on the northern part of Queensland, and in recent years Japanese encephalitis virus has been found in the Torres Strait Islands and the tip of far north Queensland. Also of interest, but with a much lower risk, are the bat-borne viruses, Hendra virus and Australian bat lyssavirus, that have caused a small number of human infections. However, it is important to remember that most tourists pass through other countries in the Asia/Pacific region on their way to and from Australia and may therefore have acquired infections prior to or after leaving Australia.

TI  - Target Product Profile of a Molecular Drug-Susceptibility Test for Use in Microscopy Centers
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB  - Background. Current phenotypic testing for drug resistance in patients with tuberculosis is inadequate primarily with respect to turnaround time. Molecular tests hold the promise of an improved time to diagnosis.
   Methods. A target product profile for a molecular drug-susceptibility test (DST) was developed on the basis of a collaborative effort that included opinions gathered from researchers, clinicians, policy makers, and test developers on optimal clinical and operational characteristics in settings of intended use. In addition, the current diagnostic ecosystem and the diagnostic development landscape were mapped.
   Results. Molecular DSTs for detecting tuberculosis in microscopy centers should ideally evaluate for resistance to rifampin, fluoroquinolones, isoniazid, and pyrazinamide and enable the selection of the most appropriate treatment regimen. Performance characteristics of DSTs need to be optimized, but compromises can be made that depend on the trade-off between a false-positive result and a false-negative result. The operational requirements of a test will vary depending on the site of implementation. However, the most-important considerations pertain to quality control, maintenance and calibration, and the ability to export data.
   Conclusion. This target product profile defines the needs as perceived by the tuberculosis stakeholder community and attempts to provide a means of communication with test developers to ensure that fit-for-purpose DSTs are being developed.

TI  - Prevalence and Genotype Allocation of Pathogenic <i>Leptospira</i> Species in Small Mammals from Various Habitat Types in Germany
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Small mammals serve as most important reservoirs for Leptospira spp., the causative agents of Leptospirosis, which is one of the most neglected and widespread zoonotic diseases worldwide. The knowledge about Leptospira spp. occurring in small mammals from Germany is scarce. Thus, this study's objectives were to investigate the occurrence of Leptospira spp. and the inherent sequence types in small mammals from three different study sites: a forest in southern Germany (site B1); a National Park in south-eastern Germany (site B2) and a renaturalised area, in eastern Germany (site S) where small mammals were captured. DNA was extracted from kidneys of small mammals and tested for Leptospira spp. by real-time PCR. Positive samples were further analysed by duplex and conventional PCRs. For 14 positive samples, multi locus sequence typing (MLST) was performed. Altogether, 1213 small mammals were captured: 216 at site B1, 456 at site B2 and 541 at site S belonging to following species: Sorex (S.) araneus, S. coronatus, Apodemus (A.) flavicollis, Myodes glareolus, Microtus (Mi.) arvalis, Crocidura russula, Arvicola terrestris, A. agrarius, Mustela nivalis, Talpa europaea, and Mi. agrestis. DNA of Leptospira spp. was detected in 6% of all small mammals. At site B1, 25 small mammals (11.6%), at site B2, 15 small mammals (3.3%) and at site S, 33 small mammals (6.1%) were positive for Leptospira spp. Overall, 54 of the positive samples were further determined as L. kirschneri, nine as L. interrogans and four as L. borgpetersenii while five real-time PCR-positive samples could not be further determined by conventional PCR. MLST results revealed focal occurrence of L. interrogans and L. kirschneri sequence type (ST) 117 while L. kirschneri ST 110 was present in small mammals at all three sites. Further, this study provides evidence for a particular host association of L. borgpetersenii to mice of the genus Apodemus.

TI  - Irradiated Male Tsetse from a 40-Year-Old Colony Are Still Competitive in a Riparian Forest in Burkina Faso
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Background: Tsetse flies are the cyclical vectors of African trypanosomosis that constitute a major constraint to development in Africa. Their control is an important component of the integrated management of these diseases, and among the techniques available, the sterile insect technique (SIT) is the sole that is efficient at low densities. The government of Burkina Faso has embarked on a tsetse eradication programme in the framework of the PATTEC, where SIT is an important component. The project plans to use flies from a Glossina palpalis gambiensis colony that has been maintained for about 40 years at the Centre International de Recherche-Developpement sur l'Elevage en zone Subhumide (CIRDES). It was thus necessary to test the competitiveness of the sterile males originating from this colony.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: During the period January-February 2010, 16,000 sterile male G. p. gambiensis were released along a tributary of the Mouhoun river. The study revealed that with a mean sterile to wild male ratio of 1.16 (s.d. 0.38), the abortion rate of the wild female flies was significantly higher than before (p = 0.026) and after (p = 0.019) the release period. The estimated competitiveness of the sterile males (Fried index) was 0.07 (s.d. 0.02), indicating that a sterile to wild male ratio of 14.4 would be necessary to obtain nearly complete induced sterility in the female population. The aggregation patterns of sterile and wild male flies were similar. The survival rate of the released sterile male flies was similar to that observed in 1983-1985 for the same colony.
   Conclusions/Significance: We conclude that gamma sterilised male G. p. gambiensis derived from the CIRDES colony have a competitiveness that is comparable to their competitiveness obtained 35 years ago and can still be used for an area-wide integrated pest management campaign with a sterile insect component in Burkina Faso.

TI  - Mayaro Virus Pathogenesis and Transmission Mechanisms
T2  - PATHOGENS
AB  - Mayaro virus (MAYV), isolated for the first time in Trinidad and Tobago, has captured the attention of public health authorities worldwide following recent outbreaks in the Americas. It has a propensity to be exported outside its original geographical range, because of the vast distribution of its vectors. Moreover, most of the world population is immunologically naive with respect to infection with MAYV which makes this virus a true threat. The recent invasion of several countries by Aedes albopictus underscores the risk of potential urban transmission of MAYV in both tropical and temperate regions. In humans, the clinical manifestations of MAYV disease range from mild fever, rash, and joint pain to arthralgia. In the absence of a licensed vaccine and clinically proven therapeutics against Mayaro fever, prevention focuses mainly on household mosquito control. However, as demonstrated for other arboviruses, mosquito control is rather inefficient for outbreak management and alternative approaches to contain the spread of MAYV are therefore necessary. Despite its strong epidemic potential, little is currently known about MAYV. This review addresses various aspects of MAYV, including its epidemiology, vector biology, mode of transmission, and clinical complications, as well as the latest developments in MAYV diagnosis.

TI  - Evaluation of natural foci of <i>Panstrongylus megistus</i> in a forest fragment in Porto Alegre, State of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil
T2  - REVISTA DA SOCIEDADE BRASILEIRA DE MEDICINA TROPICAL
AB  - Introduction: Panstrongylus megistus is commonly found in wild environments of the State of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. The aim of this study was to characterize the network of refuges used by triatomine in a forest fragment of Porto Alegre and to identify Trypanosoma cruzi infection, associated hosts and the epidemiological importance of both hosts and triatomines. Methods: Techniques including the spool-and-line method and active searching (transects) were used to identify natural foci. Results: The food source for each triatomine was determined using the precipitin test, and the infection of marsupials was determined by xenodiagnosis. A total of 33 adults (domestic environment) and 27 nymphs (wild environment) of P rnegistus were found in addition to 43 Didelphis albiventris specimens. The infection rates of triatomine adults, triatomine nymphs and opossums with T cruzi I were 64%, 73% and 69%, respectively. Birds, rodents and opossums were the main resources used by triatomine. Conclusions: This work presents the first characterization of a natural focus of? megistus in Rio Grande do Sul. The natural characteristics of this focus and its implication in the transmission of T cruzi are discussed.

TI  - Lag effect of climatic variables on dengue burden in India
T2  - EPIDEMIOLOGY AND INFECTION
AB  - Dengue is a widespread vector- borne disease believed to affect between 100 and 390 million people every year. The interaction between vector, host and pathogen is influenced by various climatic factors and the relationship between dengue and climatic conditions has been poorly explored in India. This study explores the relationship between El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) and dengue cases in India. Additionally, distributed lag non- linear model was used to assess the delayed effects of climatic factors on dengue cases. The weekly dengue cases reported by the Integrated Disease Surveillance Program (IDSP) over India during the period 2010- 2017 were analysed. The study shows that dengue cases usually follow a seasonal pattern, with most cases reported in August and September. Both temperature and rainfall were positively associated with the number of dengue cases. The precipitation shows the higher transmission risk of dengue was observed between 8 and 15 weeks of lag. The highest relative risk (RR) of dengue was observed at 60 mm rainfall with a 12- week lag period when compared with 40 and 80 mm rainfall. The RR of dengue tends to increase with increasing mean temperature above 24 degrees C. The largest transmission risk of dengue was observed at 30 degrees C with a 0- 3 weeks of lag. Similarly, the transmission risk increases more than twofold when the minimum temperature reaches 26 degrees C with a 2- week lag period. The dengue cases and El Nino were positively correlated with a 3- 6 months lag period. The significant correlation observed between the IOD and dengue cases was shown for a 0- 2 months lag period.

TI  - Blood Feeding Patterns of Potential Arbovirus Vectors of the Genus <i>Culex</i> Targeting Ectothermic Hosts
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Reptiles and amphibians constitute a significant portion of vertebrate biomass in terrestrial ecosystems and may be important arbovirus reservoirs. To investigate mosquito preference for ectothermic hosts, feeding indices were calculated from data collected in Tuskegee National Forest, Alabama, USA. Four mosquito species fed upon ectothermic hosts, with Culex peccator and Cx. territans feeding primarily upon ectotherms. These two species appeared to target distinct species with little overlap in host choice. Culex peccator was a generalist in its feeding patterns within ectotherms, and Cx. territans appeared to be a more specialized feeder. Six of eleven ectotherm species fed upon Cx. territans were fed upon more often than predicted based upon abundance. Spring peepers were highly preferred over other host species by Cx. territans. Blood meals taken from each host species varied temporally, with some hosts being targeted fairly evenly throughout the season and others being fed upon in seasonal peaks.

TI  - Risk analysis and prediction of visceral leishmaniasis dispersion in Sao Paulo State, Brazil
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is an important neglected disease caused by a protozoan parasite, and represents a serious public health problem in many parts of the world. It is zoonotic in Europe and Latin America, where infected dogs constitute the main domestic reservoir for the parasite and play a key role in VL transmission to humans. In Brazil this disease is caused by the protozoan Leishmania infantum chagasi, and is transmitted by the sand fly Lutzomyia longipalpis. Despite programs aimed at eliminating infection sources, the disease continues to spread throughout the Country. VL in Sao Paulo State, Brazil, first appeared in the northwestern region, spreading in a southeasterly direction over time. We integrate data on the VL vector, infected dogs and infected human dispersion from 1999 to 2013 through an innovative spatial temporal Bayesian model in conjunction with geographic information system. This model is used to infer the drivers of the invasion process and predict the future progression of VL through the State. We found that vector dispersion was influenced by vector presence in nearby municipalities at the previous time step, proximity to the Bolivia-Brazil gas pipeline, and high temperatures (i.e., annual average between 20 and 23 degrees C). Key factors affecting infected dog dispersion included proximity to the Marechal Rondon Highway, high temperatures, and presence of the competent vector within the same municipality. Finally, vector presence, presence of infected dogs, and rainfall (approx. 270 to 540mm/year) drove the dispersion of human VL cases. Surprisingly, economic factors exhibited no noticeable influence on disease dispersion. Based on these drivers and stochastic simulations, we identified which municipalities are most likely to be invaded by vectors and infected hosts in the future. Prioritizing prevention and control strategies within the identified municipalities may help halt the spread of VL while reducing monitoring costs. Our results contribute important knowledge to public and animal health policy planning, and suggest that prevention and control strategies should focus on vector control and on blocking contact between vectors and hosts in the priority areas identified to be at risk.

TI  - Graphene quantum dots induce cascadic apoptosis <i>via</i> interaction with proteins associated with anti-oxidation after endocytosis by <i>Trypanosoma brucei</i>
T2  - FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
AB  - Trypanosoma brucei, the pathogen causing African sleeping sickness (trypanosomiasis) in humans, causes debilitating diseases in many regions of the world, but mainly in African countries with tropical and subtropical climates. Enormous efforts have been devoted to controlling trypanosomiasis, including expanding vector control programs, searching for novel anti-trypanosomial agents, and developing vaccines, but with limited success. In this study, we systematically investigated the effect of graphene quantum dots (GQDs) on trypanosomal parasites and their underlying mechanisms. Ultrasmall-sized GQDs can be efficiently endocytosed by T. brucei and with no toxicity to mammalian-derived cells, triggering a cascade of apoptotic reactions, including mitochondrial disorder, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) elevation, Ca2+ accumulation, DNA fragmentation, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis impairment, and cell cycle arrest. All of these were caused by the direct interaction between GQDs and the proteins associated with cell apoptosis and anti-oxidation responses, such as trypanothione reductase (TryR), a key protein in anti-oxidation. GQDs specifically inhibited the enzymatic activity of TryR, leading to a reduction in the antioxidant capacity and, ultimately, parasite apoptotic death. These data, for the first time, provide a basis for the exploration of GQDs in the development of anti-trypanosomials.

TI  - Advances in the study of Afrotropical vectors
T2  - ANNALS OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND PARASITOLOGY
CP  - 5th CEC Malaria Contract Holders Meeting
AB  - An STD-funded 'Network for Field Research on Afrotropical Malaria Vectors' has led to several advances in our knowledge of these insects. The utilization of new methods (genetic, molecular and immunological) for the study and characterization of these vectors and for the identification of malarial parasites during the sporogonic cycle has been investigated. The prediction and monitoring of variations in vector populations, related to ecological changes induced by irrigation of arid areas, urbanization, desalination and deforestation, have also been considered.
   In Mali, the results of ecological and genetic studies of the Mopti form of Anopheles gambiae s.s. have indicated that some of the inversions found in the '2R' arrangements are of an adaptive nature. The results of similar studies on An. funestus indicate that this species may represent a complex, with two independent taxonomic units. In Madagascar, An. funestus has been found to overwinter in the highlands, for up to 2 months. Investigation of the An. gambiae complex in coastal, saltwater environments in Guinea-Bissau demonstrated that the local An. gambiae s.s. and An. funestus have different ecogeogaphical and seasonal patterns. The existence of a chromosomal form of An. gambiae, designated 'Bissau', which co-exists with a 'forest' form, was also confirmed. Whenever possible, the network will continue its research activities in association with on-going malaria-control projects.

TI  - Machine Learning Modeling of <i>Aedes albopictus</i> Habitat Suitability in the 21st Century
T2  - INSECTS
AB  - The Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, is an important vector of arboviruses that cause diseases such as dengue, chikungunya, and zika. The vector is highly invasive and adapted to survive in temperate northern territories outside its native tropical and sub-tropical range. Climate and socio-economic change are expected to facilitate its range expansion and exacerbate the global vector-borne disease burden. To project shifts in the global habitat suitability of the vector, we developed an ensemble machine learning model, incorporating a combination of a Random Forest and XGBoost binary classifiers, trained with a global collection of vector surveillance data and an extensive set of climate and environmental constraints. We demonstrate the reliable performance and wide applicability of the ensemble model in comparison to the known global presence of the vector, and project that suitable habitats will expand globally, most significantly in the northern hemisphere, putting at least an additional billion people at risk of vector-borne diseases by the middle of the 21st century. We project several highly populated areas of the world will be suitable for Ae. albopictus populations, such as the northern parts of the USA, Europe, and India by the end of the century, which highlights the need for coordinated preventive surveillance efforts of potential entry points by local authorities and stakeholders.

AB  - Ebola hemorrhagic fever outbreaks occurred in 1975-1979 and 1994-1996 within tropical Africa, It was determined from Landsat satellite data that all outbreaks occurred in tropical forest with a range of human intrusions. Meteorological satellite data, spanning the 1981 to 2000 time period, showed that marked and sudden climate changes from drier to wetter conditions were associated with the Ebola outbreaks in the 1990s. The extent of the marked climate changes suggest that Ebola outbreaks are possible over large areas of equitorial Africa, Our analysis is limited by only having one Ebola hemorrhagic fever outbreak during our period of study.

TI  - Biomass estimation of <i>Sonneratia caseolaris</i> (l.) Engler at a coastal area of Hai Phong city (Vietnam) using ALOS-2 PALSAR imagery and GIS-based multi-layer perceptron neural networks
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
AB  - This study tested the use of machine learning techniques for the estimation of above-ground biomass (AGB) of Sonneratia caseolaris in a coastal area of Hai Phong city, Vietnam. We employed a GIS database and multi-layer perceptron neural networks (MLPNN) to build and verify an AGB model, drawing upon data from a survey of 1508 mangrove trees in 18 sampling plots and ALOS-2 PALSAR imagery. We assessed the model's performance using root-mean-square error, mean absolute error, coefficient of determination (R-2), and leave-one-out cross-validation. We also compared the model's usability with four machine learning techniques: support vector regression, radial basis function neural networks, Gaussian process, and random forest. The MLPNN model performed well and outperformed the machine learning techniques. The MLPNN model-estimated AGB ranged between 2.78 and 298.95Mgha(-1) (average=55.8Mgha(-1)); below-ground biomass ranged between 4.06 and 436.47Mgha(-1) (average=81.47Mgha(-1)), and total carbon stock ranged between 3.22 and 345.65Mg C ha(-1) (average=64.52Mg C ha(-1)). We conclude that ALOS-2 PALSAR data can be accurately used with MLPNN models for estimating mangrove forest biomass in tropical areas.

TI  - Drug discovery and beyond: the role of public-private partnerships in improving access to new malaria medicines
T2  - TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
CP  - 53rd Annual Meeting of the American-Society-of-Tropical-Medicine-and-Hygiene
AB  - Traditional pharmaceutical research and development (R&D) strategy has failed to address the desperate need for new antimalarial drugs. The populations affected are too poor to attract commercially-driven R&D. Over the last few years, a new model, the public-private partnership for product development, has radically changed the antimalarial R&D landscape. The partnerships bring together academic and industry expertise with funding from governmental, philanthropic and charitable sources. The Medicines for Malaria Venture, a not-for-profit foundation based in Geneva, aims to develop new antimalarials for developing countries through public-private partnership. It is currently managing a portfolio of around 20 projects at various stages of development. However, as in all drug R&D, some of these projects will fail. The portfolio approach helps to maximize the chances of success, but there are obvious challenges, including financial and managerial ones. Proactive management of the two vital interfaces in the drug supply chain is important for success. Upstream, basic research must be aligned with translational research in order to ensure a continuous supply of leads into the development pipeline. Meanwhile, downstream, drug discovery and development must be aligned with access to ensure optimal health impact. All stages require partnership, sustainable financing and the engagement of disease-endemic countries. The recent G8 report on Africa has tent support to mechanisms aimed at improving health and achieving the Millenium Development Goals.

TI  - Uncommon specialization in a mutualism between a temperate herbaceous plant guild and an ant: are <i>Aphaenogaster</i> ants keystone mutualists?
T2  - OIKOS
AB  - Ant-dispersed herbs (myrmecochores) can account for more than one-third of the stems in the temperate deciduous forests of eastern North America. Because many ant species have been observed collecting the seeds, this interaction is often described as a generalized mutualism. Here, we combine fieldwork and meta-analyses to test this assumption. Our meta-analysis demonstrated that Aphaenogaster ants (predominantly A. rudis) collect approximately 74 +/- 26% (mean +/- SD) of the myrmecochorous seeds in eastern North American forests where any encounters with Aphaenogaster were reported, and approximately 61 +/- 37% of the seeds in all the eastern forests where any seed collection has been monitored. This remarkable monopolization of seeds is due to at least two factors: 1) Aphaenogaster are significantly more likely to collect the ant-adapted seeds they discover than are ten other ant genera found in these forests and 2) the densities of Aphaenogaster and myrmecochorous plants are positively correlated at three nested spatial scales (within 20x20 m patches, among patches within a forest, and among 41 forests in the eastern United States). Although other ants can collect seeds, our analyses demonstrate that A. rudis is the primary seed dispersal vector for most of this rich temperate ant-dispersed flora. The low levels of plant partner diversity for myrmecochores demonstrated here rivals that of tropical ant-plants (myrmecophytes) and well exceeds that typically observed in temperate plant-frugivore and plant-pollinator mutualisms and myrmecochory in other biomes.

TI  - Distribution of the assemblage of phlebotomine sandflies (Diptera: Psychodidae) along an environmental gradient
T2  - BIOTA NEOTROPICA
AB  - The geographical distribution of leishmaniasis has undoubtedly expanded, and is now being reported to be in areas that were previously non-endemic. This study therefore aimed to investigate whether there is any variation in the structure and in the composition of phlebotomine communities along an environmental gradient-from a mesic to a xeric environment, across different climatic periods (rainy and dry seasons). Furthermore, we test whether there were differences in sex ratio of sand flies between wet and dry environments. A total of 535 specimens of sand flies belonging to 18 species were recorded. Richness, abundance, and composition of species were significatively higher in the xeric environment (semidecidual Forest) compared to the mesic environment (Riparina Forest). We unveiled site specific differences in sand fly collections since the community composition changes with the geographic distance among the sampling points. These results led to the conclusion that for sand flies species, the environmental conditions available for each species could be different within the habitat taking into account the degree of humidity in the forest as well as the climatic season (dry or wet). The present study gives a valuable contribution to the knowledge of sand flies, as a group of insects, from the Atlantic Forest biome.

TI  - A Comprehensive Review on the Chemical Constituents and Functional Uses of Walnut (<i>Juglans</i> spp.) Husk
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
AB  - The walnut (Juglans spp.) is an appreciated nut that belongs to the Juglandaceae family. The fruit includes four main parts: the kernel, the skin, the shell, and the green husk. It is widely cultivated due to its edible kernel. In walnut production centers, high amounts of the husk as an agro-forest waste product are produced and discarded away. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the walnut green husk could be valued as a source of different natural bioactive compounds with excellent antioxidant and antimicrobial properties. Regarding this respect, in this contribution, the current scientific knowledge on the antioxidant and antiradical activities, various identified and isolated individual chemical constituents, as well as the functional applications of the walnut husk with more emphasis on the Persian walnut (Juglans regia L.) are reviewed.

TI  - Deployable Molecular Detection of Arboviruses in the Australian Outback
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - The most common causes of human infection from the arboviruses that are endemic in Australia are the arthritogenic alphaviruses: Ross River virus (RRV) and Barmah Forest virus (BFV). The most serious infections are caused by the neurotropic flaviviruses, Murray Valley encephalitis virus (MVEV) and the Kunjin subtype of West Nile virus. The greatest individual risk of arbovirus infection occurs in tropical/subtropical northern Australia because of the warm, wet summer conditions from December to June, where conventional arbovirus surveillance is difficult due to a combination of low population density, large distances between population centers, poor roads, and seasonal flooding. Furthermore, virus detection requires samples to be sent to Perth up to 2,000 km away for definitive analysis, causing delays of days to weeks before test results are available and public health interventions can be started. We deployed a portable molecular biology laboratory for remote field detection of endemic arboviruses in northern Queensland, then in tropical Western Australia and detected BFV, MVEV, and RRV RNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays of extracts from mosquitoes trapped in Queensland. We then used a field-portable compact real-time thermocycler for the samples collected in the Kimberley region of Western Australia. Real-time field PCR assays enabled concurrent endemic arbovirus distribution mapping in outback Queensland and Western Australia. Our deployable laboratory method provides a concept of operations for future remote area arbovirus surveillance.

TI  - Undersampling: case studies of flaviviral inhibitory activities
T2  - JOURNAL OF COMPUTER-AIDED MOLECULAR DESIGN
AB  - Imbalanced datasets, comprising of more inactive compounds relative to the active ones, are a common challenge in ligand-based model building workflows for drug discovery. This is particularly true for neglected tropical diseases since efforts to identify therapeutics for these diseases are often limited. In this report, we analyze the performance of several undersampling strategies in modeling the Dengue Virus 2 (DENV2) inhibitory activity, as well as the anti-flaviviral activities for the West Nile (WNV) and Zika (ZIKV) viruses. To this end, we build datasets comprising of 1218 (159 actives and 1059 inactives), 1044 (132 actives and 912 inactives) and 302 (75 actives and 227 inactives) molecules with known DENV2, WNV and ZIKV inhibitory activity profiles, respectively. We develop ensemble classifiers for these endpoints and compare the performance of the different undersampling algorithms on external sets. It is observed that data pruning algorithms yield superior performance relative to data selection algorithms. The best overall performance is provided by the one-sided selection algorithm with test set balanced accuracy (BACC) values of 0.84, 0.74 and 0.77 for the DENV2, WNV and ZIKV inhibitory activities, respectively. For the model building, we use the recently proposed GT-STAF information indices, and compare the predictivity of 3 molecular fragmentation approaches: connected subgraphs, substructure and alogp atom types, which are observed to show comparable performance. On the other hand, a combination of indices based on these fragmentation strategies enhances the predictivity of the built ensembles. The built models could be useful for screening new molecules with possible DENV, WNV and ZIKV inhibitory activities. ADMET modelers are encouraged to adopt undersampling algorithms in their workflows when dealing with imbalanced datasets.

TI  - The Antiviral Alkaloid Berberine Reduces Chikungunya Virus-Induced Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Signaling
T2  - JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY
AB  - Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) has infected millions of people in the tropical and subtropical regions since its reemergence in the last decade. We recently identified the nontoxic plant alkaloid berberine as an antiviral substance against CHIKV in a high-throughput screen. Here, we show that berberine is effective in multiple cell types against a variety of CHIKV strains, also at a high multiplicity of infection, consolidating the potential of berberine as an antiviral drug. We excluded any effect of this compound on virus entry or on the activity of the viral replicase. A human phosphokinase array revealed that CHIKV infection specifically activated the major mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK), p38 and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK). Upon treatment with berberine, this virus-induced MAPK activation was markedly reduced. Subsequent analyses with specific inhibitors of these kinases indicated that the ERK and JNK signaling cascades are important for the generation of progeny virions. In contrast to specific MAPK inhibitors, berberine lowered virus-induced activation of all major MAPK pathways and resulted in a stronger reduction in viral titers. Further, we assessed the in vivo efficacy of berberine in a mouse model and measured a significant reduction of CHIKV-induced inflammatory disease. In summary, we demonstrate the efficacy of berberine as a drug against CHIKV and highlight the importance of the MAPK signaling pathways in the alphavirus infectious cycle.

TI  - Global Occurrence and Spread of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Virus of the Subtype H5N1
T2  - AVIAN DISEASES
AB  - Highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses of the subtype H5N1 (HPAIV-H5N1) have circulated continuously in Asia, Europe, and Africa since 2003. Investigations on the environmental preference and global spread processes of the virus are needed. We compiled 16 environmental variables to assess their correlation with HPAIV-H5N1 occurrences by using a niche-based model called Maxent. We found the virus had the strongest positive association with the human footprint index, as well as the presence of certain types of wetlands and mild temperature (10-30 C). Outbreaks of HPAIV-H5N1 in poultry or wild birds were also more frequent in certain major habitat types (e.g., tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests, temperate broadleaf and mixed forests, and flooded grasslands and savannas) and ecoregions. We conducted trend surface analysis to generate the travelling wave of the virus' global spread from 2003 to 2009, which indicated that high mountains or plateaus did not affect the spread speed and direction.

TI  - Assessing dengue fever risk in Costa Rica by using climate variables and machine learning techniques
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Dengue fever is a vector-borne disease affecting millions yearly, mostly in tropical and subtropical countries. Driven mainly by social and environmental factors, dengue incidence and geographical expansion have increased in recent decades. Therefore, understanding how climate variables drive dengue outbreaks is challenging and a problem of interest for decision-makers that could aid in improving surveillance and resource allocation. Here, we explore the effect of climate variables on relative dengue risk in 32 cantons of interest for public health authorities in Costa Rica. Relative dengue risk is forecast using a Generalized Additive Model for location, scale, and shape and a Random Forest approach. Models use a training period from 2000 to 2020 and predicted climatic variables obtained with a vector auto-regressive model. Results show reliable projections, and climate variables predictions allow for a prospective instead of a retrospective study.
   Author summaryDengue fever is a vector-borne viral disease endemic to tropical and subtropical countries. The virus is transmitted by female Aedes mosquitoes and affects approximately 100 million people every year. Although most infections are mild or asymptomatic, some may cause severe symptoms, leading to a higher risk of death. In the affected countries, the challenges associated with preventing and controlling dengue outbreaks have highlighted the need for novel tools. In this context, using statistical tools with climate and epidemiological information makes it possible to provide timely information to public health officials about the risk of dengue outbreaks, allowing the optimization of resources and preventive and non-reactive decision-making.

TI  - Concomitant malaria, dengue and COVID-19: extraordinary challenge for Colombia's public health system
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Malaria and dengue are vector-borne endemic diseases in the low-lying regions of Colombia. Outbreaks of both diseases appear during the occurrence of El Nino in the tropical Pacific. We present updated data confirming the relation, which are explained by the increase in temperature. Malaria shows an increasing trend, of which climate change cannot be disregarded. The migration of over 1 200 000 Venezuelans hiding away from the internal crisis has complicated the situation. Further research is needed to pinpoint the linkages between vector-borne diseases and climate variability, but also with current and future impacts of climate change, and alarming deforestation rates of Colombia. The public health system has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in the poorest and most vulnerable regions (Pacific coast, Amazon and Orinoco). This note constitutes a call to Colombia's public health system to maintain vector and waterborne diseases services, which cannot become neglected amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

TI  - Bryophyte dispersal by flying foxes: a novel discovery
T2  - OECOLOGIA
AB  - This research provides the first evidence of dispersal of bryophytes and associated microorganisms through ingestion by a highly mobile vertebrate vector, the spectacled flying fox (Pteropus conspicillatus). Bryophyte fragments were found in faeces collected at four P. conspicillatus' camps in the Wet Tropics bioregion, northeastern Australia. These fragments were viable when grown in culture; live invertebrates and other organisms were also present. Our study has significantly increased understanding of the role of flying foxes as dispersal vectors in tropical forests.

TI  - Body size affects immune cell proportions in birds and non-volant mammals, but not bats
T2  - JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY
AB  - Powered flight has evolved several times in vertebrates and constrains morphology and physiology in ways that likely have shaped how organisms cope with infections. Some of these constraints probably have impacts on aspects of immunology, such that larger fliers might prioritize risk reduction and safety. Addressing how the evolution of flight may have driven relationships between body size and immunity could be particularly informative for understanding the propensity of some taxa to harbor many virulent and sometimes zoonotic pathogens without showing clinical disease. Here, we used a comparative framework to quantify scaling relationships between body mass and the proportions of two types of white blood cells - lymphocytes and granulocytes (neutrophils/heterophils) - across 63 bat species, 400 bird species and 251 nonvolant mammal species. By using phylogenetically informed statistical models on field-collected data from wild Neotropical bats and from captive bats, non-volant mammals and birds, we show that lymphocyte and neutrophil proportions do not vary systematically with body mass among bats. In contrast, larger birds and non-volant mammals have disproportionately higher granulocyte proportions than expected for their body size. Our inability to distinguish bat lymphocyte scaling from birds and bat granulocyte scaling from all other taxa suggests there may be other ecological explanations (i.e. not flight related) for the cell proportion scaling patterns. Future comparative studies of wild bats, birds and non-volant mammals of similar body mass should aim to further differentiate evolutionary effects and other aspects of life history on immune defense and its role in the tolerance of (zoonotic) infections.

TI  - Spatial epidemiology of yellow fever: Identification of determinants of the 2016-2018 epidemics and at-risk areas in Brazil
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Author summary
   Yellow fever (YF) is a vector-borne disease and from December 2016 until 2020, caused infection and death in humans and monkeys in the Southeast and South of Brazil. The transmission cycle includes hosts and vectors whose presence and abundance are driven by environmental conditions. Ecological niche models are expected to identify biotic and abiotic conditions favourable to a species and to predict its likelihood of presence. Such models have shown their relevance to determine the environmental and anthropogenic variables favourable for host and vector species of infectious diseases, and consequently for highlighting more at-risk areas. Relying on human and monkey populations, we showed how temperature, rain, predicted mammal density, human impact, and vaccination coverage explained the occurrence of YF cases in 2017-2018 Brazilian epidemics. We predicted at-risk areas for future outbreaks, including areas outside and surrounding the Amazon basin, YF cases occurring later, in 2019 and 2020, were observed in the predicted at-risk areas using our modelling approach. This modelling approach, relying on ecology theory and methodological framework for using epidemiological data, helps to identify human threatened populations, for which vaccination efforts should be oriented, and also for monkeys whose preservation is the main biodiversity concern.
   Optimise control strategies of infectious diseases, identify factors that favour the circulation of pathogens, and propose risk maps are crucial challenges for global health. Ecological niche modelling, once relying on an adequate framework and environmental descriptors can be a helpful tool for such purposes. Despite the existence of a vaccine, yellow fever (YF) is still a public health issue. Brazil faced massive sylvatic YF outbreaks from the end of 2016 up to mid-2018, but cases in human and non-human primates have been recorded until the beginning of 2020. Here we used both human and monkey confirmed YF cases from two epidemic periods (2016/2017 and 2017/2018) to describe the spatial distribution of the cases and explore how biotic and abiotic factors drive their occurrence. The distribution of YF cases largely overlaps for humans and monkeys, and a contraction of the spatial extent associated with a southward displacement is observed during the second period of the epidemics. More contributive variables to the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of cases were related to biotic factors (mammal richness), abiotic factors (temperature and precipitation), and some human-related variables (population density, human footprint, and human vaccination coverage). Both projections of the most favourable conditions showed similar trends with a contraction of the more at-risk areas. Once extrapolated at a large scale, the Amazon basin remains at lower risk, although surrounding forest regions and notably the North-West region, would face a higher risk. Spatial projections of infectious diseases often relied on climatic variables only; here for both models, we instead highlighted the importance of considering local biotic conditions, hosts vulnerability, social and epidemiological factors to run the spatial risk analysis correctly: all YF cases occurring later on, in 2019 and 2020, were observed in the predicted at-risk areas.

TI  - Retrieving leaf area index of rubber plantation in Hainan Island using empirical and neural network models with Landsat images
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
AB  - The leaf area index (LAI) is an important parameter for describing the growth status and canopy structure of vegetation. The rapid and accurate acquisition of the vegetation or agroforestry LAI has great scientific significance in agroforestry ecological ecosystems research and a very important practical value for guiding agricultural and forestry production. In this study, the typical tropical crops (rubber forest) in Hainan Island were selected as the research area, the empirical and neural network (NN) LAI estimation models of rubber forest were constructed based on satellite remote sensing vegetation indices and the field LAI measurement data, and the spatiotemporal variation was analyzed. The results showed that, compared with normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), green NDVI (GNDVI), ratio VI (RVI), normalized near-infrared (NNIR), wide dynamic range VI (WDRVI), and normalized difference water index (NDWI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), DVI, renormalized DVI (RDVI), and modified SAVI (MSAVI) have higher correlations with LAI. Among the LAI estimation models of rubber forest based on empirical and artificial NN (ANN) models, the estimation accuracy of ANN achieves the highest value. The linear fitting determination coefficient R-2 of the observed and simulated rubber forest LAI was 0.85 (p < 0.001), the root mean square error (RMSE) was 0.15, and the average relative error (RE) was 1.93%. However, there was underestimation in the middle-value area and overestimation in the high- and low-value areas of LAI. Based on remote sensing mapping of the rubber forest LAI, the high LAI values (4.40 to 6.00 m(2) m( - 2)) were mainly distributed in Danzhou and Baisha (west of Hainan Island); the middle LAI values (3.80 to 4.40 m(2) m( - 2)) were mainly located in Chengmai, Tunchang, and Qiongzhong (middle of Hainan Island); and the low LAI values (<3.80 m(2) m( - 2)) were shown primarily on Ding'an, Qionghai, Wanning, Ledong, and Sanya (east and south of Hainan Island). In summary, the remote sensing estimation model for the rubber plantation LAI based on the vegetation index has high accuracy and good values for application.

TI  - Analysing published global Ebola Virus Disease research using social network analysis
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Introduction
   The 2014/2015 West African Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak attracted global attention. Numerous opinions claimed that the global response was impaired, in part because, the EVD research was neglected, although quantitative or qualitative studies did not exist. Our objective was to analyse how the EVD research landscape evolved by exploring the existing research network and its communities before and during the outbreak in West Africa.
   Methods/Principal findings
   Social network analysis (SNA) was used to analyse collaborations between institutions named by co-authors as affiliations in publications on EVD. Bibliometric data of publications on EVD between 1976 and 2015 was collected from Thomson Reuters' Web of Science Core Collection (WoS). Freely available software was used for network analysis at a global-level and for 10-year periods. The networks are presented as undirected-weighted graphs. Rankings by degree and betweenness were calculated to identify central and powerful network positions; modularity function was used to identify research communities. Overall 4,587 publications were identified, of which 2,528 were original research articles. Those yielded 1,644 authors' affiliated institutions and 9,907 connections for co-authorship network construction. The majority of institutions were from the USA, Canada and Europe. Collaborations with research partners on the African continent did exist, but less frequently. Around six highly connected organisations in the network were identified with powerful and broker positions. Network characteristics varied widely among the 10-year periods and evolved from 30 to 1,489 institutions and 60 to 9,176 connections respectively. Most influential actors are from public or governmental institutions whereas private sector actors, in particular the pharmaceutical industry, are largely absent.
   Conclusion/Significance
   Research output on EVD has increased over time and surged during the 2014/2015 outbreak. The overall EVD research network is organised around a few key actors, signalling a concentration of expertise but leaving room for increased cooperation with other institutions especially from affected countries. Finding innovative ways to maintain support for these pivotal actors while steering the global EVD research network towards an agenda driven by agreed, prioritized needs and finding ways to better integrate currently peripheral and newer expertise may accelerate the translation of research into the development of necessary live saving products for EVD ahead of the next outbreak.

TI  - Residual Malaria Transmission in Select Countries of Asia-Pacific Region: Old Wine in a New Barrel
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB  - Background. Despite substantial reductions in malaria burden and improvement in case management, malaria remains a major public health challenge in the Asia-Pacific region. Residual malaria transmission (RMT) is the fraction of total transmission that persists after achievement of full operational coverage with effective insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs)/long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) and/or indoor residual spray interventions. There is a critical need to standardize and share best practices for entomological, anthropological, and product development investigative protocols to meet the challenges of RMT and elimination goals.
   Methods. A systematic review was conducted to describe when and where RMT is occurring, while specifically targeting ownership and usage of ITN/LLINs, indoor residual spray application, insecticide susceptibility of vectors, and human and vector biting behavior, with a focus on nighttime activities.
   Results. Sixty-six publications from 1995 to present met the inclusion criteria for closer review. Associations between local vector control coverage and use with behaviors of human and mosquito vectors varied by locality and circumstance. Consequently, the magnitude of RMT is insufficiently studied and analyzed with sparse estimates of individual exposure in communities, insufficient or incomplete observations of ITN/LLIN use, and the local human population movement into and from high-risk areas.
   Conclusions. This review identified significant gaps or deficiencies that require urgent attention, namely, developing standardized procedures and methods to estimate risk exposure beyond the peridomestic setting, analytical approaches to measure key human-vector interactions, and seasonal location-specific agricultural or forest use calendars, and establishing the collection of longitudinal human and vector data close in time and location.

TI  - Disease will limit future food supply from the global crustacean fishery and aquaculture sectors
T2  - JOURNAL OF INVERTEBRATE PATHOLOGY
AB  - Seafood is a highly traded food commodity. Farmed and captured crustaceans contribute a significant proportion with annual production exceeding 10 M metric tonnes with first sale value of $40bn. The sector is dominated by farmed tropical marine shrimp, the fastest growing sector of the global aquaculture industry. It is significant in supporting rural livelihoods and alleviating poverty in producing nations within Asia and Latin America while forming an increasing contribution to aquatic food supply in more developed countries. Nations with marine borders often also support important marine fisheries for crustaceans that are regionally traded as live animals and commodity products. A general separation of net producing and net consuming nations for crustacean seafood has created a truly globalised food industry. Projections for increasing global demand for seafood in the face of level or declining fisheries requires continued expansion and intensification of aquaculture while ensuring best utilisation of captured stocks. Furthermore, continued pressure from consuming nations to ensure safe products for human consumption are being augmented by additional legislative requirements for animals (and their products) to be of low disease status. As a consequence, increasing emphasis is being placed on enforcement of regulations and better governance of the sector; currently this is a challenge in light of a fragmented industry and less stringent regulations associated with animal disease within producer nations. Current estimates predict that up to 40% of tropical shrimp production (>$3bn) is lost annually, mainly due to viral pathogens for which standard preventative measures (e.g. such as vaccination) are not feasible. In light of this problem, new approaches are urgently required to enhance yield by improving broodstock and larval sourcing, promoting best management practices by farmer outreach and supporting cutting-edge research that aims to harness the natural abilities of invertebrates to mitigate assault from pathogens (e.g. the use of RNA interference therapeutics). In terms of fisheries losses associated with disease, key issues are centred on mortality and quality degradation in the post-capture phase, largely due to poor grading and handling by fishers and the industry chain. Occurrence of disease in wild crustaceans is also widely reported, with some indications that climatic changes may be increasing susceptibility to important pathogens (e.g. the parasite Hematodinium). However, despite improvements in field and laboratory diagnostics, defining population-level effects of disease in these fisheries remains elusive. Coordination of disease specialists with fisheries scientists will be required to understand current and future impacts of existing and emergent diseases on wild stocks. Overall, the increasing demand for crustacean seafood in light of these issues signals a clear warning for the future sustainability of this global industry. The linking together of global experts in the culture, capture and trading of crustaceans with pathologists, epidemiologists, ecologists, therapeutics specialists and policy makers in the field of food security will allow these issues to be better identified and addressed.

TI  - Potential invasion of exotic ambrosia beetles <i>Xyleborus glabratus</i> and <i>Euwallacea</i> sp in Mexico: A major threat for native and cultivated forest ecosystems
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - We analyze the invasive potential of two Asian ambrosia beetles, Xyleborus glabratus and Euwallacea sp., into Mexico and the southern United States. The fungal symbionts of these beetles have been responsible for damage to trees of the family Lauraceae, including Persea americana and other noncultivated tree species on both coasts of the United States. We estimate their potential threat using ecological niche modeling and spatial multi-criteria evaluation protocols to incorporate plant and beetle suitabilities as well as forest stress factors across Mexico. Mexico contains higher climatic and habitat suitability for X. glabratus than for Euwallacea sp. Within this country, the neotropical region is most vulnerable to invasion by both of these species. We also identify a corridor of potential invasion for X. glabratus along the Gulf of Mexico coast where most Lauraceae and native Xyleborus species are present; dispersal of either X. glabratus or Euwallacea sp. into this region would likely lead to major disease spread. However, the overall potential damage that these beetles can cause may be a function of how many reproductive hosts and how many other ambrosia beetles are present, as well as of their capacity to disperse. This work can also alert relevant managers and authorities regarding this threat.

TI  - Mayaro virus fever in French Guiana:: Isolation, identification, and seroprevalence
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - This paper reports the first isolation of Mayaro (MAY) virus from a patient infected in French Guiana. The identification was initially performed using immunofluorescent antibody testing with specific mouse antibody, and confirmed by plaque-reduction neutralization testing and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. To determine if MAY virus infection is widespread in French Guiana, a serosurvey was performed to determine the prevalence of antibody to this virus in various ethnic groups and areas of French Guiana. Human sera (n = 1,962) were screened using the hemagglutination inhibition (I-EI) test. To determine whether MAY virus circulates in the rain forest, a serosurvey in monkey populations was performed. Monkey sera (n = 150) were also screened for antibody to MAY virus using HI testing. Of the human sera tested, 6.3% were positive for anti-MAY virus antibodies. Significant differences in MAY virus seroprevalence between different age groups were observed. Seroprevalence rates increased with age, with a large increase in people 10-19 years of age in comparison with those less than 10 years of age. After adjustment for age, significant differences were also found between places of residence. The prevalence of anti-MAY virus antibody was higher in people living in contact with the forest, especially in the Haut Oyapock area (odds ratio [OR] = 97.7, 95% confidence interval [CT] = 48.2-197.9) and along the Maroni River (OR = 39.7, 95% CI = 20.6-76.6). The ethnic differences observed in this study were probably due to differences in residence. Among monkeys, higher seroprevalence rates were found in Alouatta seniculus (66.0%) than in Saguinus midas (18.2%). Among Alouatta, the seroprevalence increased significantly with weight land therefore with age). This study indicates that MAY virus is present in French Guiana, and human infections occur in areas where people live near the tropical rain forest.

TI  - Evolution of endemic and sylvatic lineages of dengue virus
T2  - CLADISTICS
AB  - Recent disease outbreaks have raised awareness of tropical pathogens, especially mosquito-borne viruses. Dengue virus (DENV) is a widely studied mammalian pathogen transmitted by various species of mosquito in the genus Aedes, especially Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. The prevailing view of the research community is that endemic viral lineages that cause epidemics of DENV in humans have emerged over time from sylvatic viral lineages, which persist in wild, non-human primates. These notions have been examined by researchers through phylogenetic analyses of the envelope gene (E) from the four serotypes of DENV (serotypes DENV-1 to DENV-4). In these previous reports, researchers used visual inspection of a phylogeny in order to assert that sylvatic lineages lead to endemic clades. In making this assertion, these researchers also reasserted the model of periodic sylvatic to endemic disease outbreaks. Since that study, there has been a significant increase in data both in terms of metadata (e.g., place and host of isolation) and genetic sequences of DENV. Here, we re-examine the model of sylvatic to endemic shifts in viral lineages through a phylogenetic tree search and character evolution study of metadata on the tree. We built a dataset of nucleotide sequences for 188 isolates of DENV that have metadata on sylvatic or endemic sampling along with three orthologous sequences from West Nile virus as the outgroup for the phylogenetic analysis. In contrast to previous research, we find that there are several shifts from endemic to sylvatic lineages as well as sylvatic to endemic lineages, indicating a much more dynamic model of evolution. We propose that a model that allows oscillation between sylvatic and endemic hosts better captures the dynamics of DENV transmission. (c) The Willi Hennig Society 2019.

TI  - Environmental suitability for lymphatic filariasis in Nigeria
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
AB  - Background: Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a mosquito-borne parasitic disease and a major cause of disability worldwide. It is one of the neglected tropical diseases identified by the World Health Organization for elimination as a public health problem by 2020. Maps displaying disease distribution are helpful tools to identify high-risk areas and target scarce control resources.
   Methods: We used pre-intervention site-level occurrence data from 1192 survey sites collected during extensive mapping surveys by the Nigeria Ministry of Health. Using an ensemble of machine learning modelling algorithms (generalised boosted models and random forest), we mapped the ecological niche of LF at a spatial resolution of 1 km(2). By overlaying gridded estimates of population density, we estimated the human population living in LF risk areas on a 100 x 100 m scale.
   Results: Our maps demonstrate that there is a heterogeneous distribution of LF risk areas across Nigeria, with large portions of northern Nigeria having more environmentally suitable conditions for the occurrence of LF. Here we estimated that approximately 110 million individuals live in areas at risk of LF transmission.
   Conclusions: Machine learning and ensemble modelling are powerful tools to map disease risk and are known to yield more accurate predictive models with less uncertainty than single models. The resulting map provides a geographical framework to target control efforts and assess its potential impacts.

TI  - EPIDEMIOLOGY OF BOVINE ANAPLASMOSIS AND BABESIOSIS IN COSTA-RICA
T2  - PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE
AB  - A serum bank created by the National Brucellosis Control Program during 1991 consisted of approximately 4000 sera collected from farms in each of the seven provinces in Costa Rica. Sera were used to determine the prevalence of antibodies directed against Anaplasma marginale, Babesia bigemina and Babesia bovis in Costa Rica and to study some geographical, ecological and management factors which could influence the epidemiology of the infection. The overall seroprevalence in bovines was 72.4%, 55.4% and 54. 1% for A. marginale, B. bigemina and B. bovis, respectively. The Moran's index or spatial autocorrelation coefficient, which tests the significance of geographical patterns in disease distribution, indicated two foci of seropositivity in the country for B. bovis: one located mainly in the dry tropical forest and the other located in the tropical moist forest. Suggested foci were corroborated by a risk assessment using the random effects models.

TI  - Oleogel: definition, possible applications and further developments
T2  - RIVISTA ITALIANA DELLE SOSTANZE GRASSE
AB  - Oleogelation is defined as the process able to convert a liquid oil into an anhydrous, viscoelastic self-standing material called oleogel [1]. In recent years, this topic has attracted an increasing interest and the research in this area is progressively growing. Different food applications have been proposed for oleogels. The most promising one is their use as fat substitute to obtain healthier foods with reduced content of sat/trans fatty acids. Currently, the fat substitution is highly demanded due to the health issues associated with the consumption of lipids rich in saturated/trans fatty acids, such as animal fats (e.g. butter and lard), tropical oils (e.g. palm oil, palm kernel oil and coconut oil), margarine and shortenings containing them. As extensively demonstrated, their excessive intake is closely related to the increase of the risk of incidence of many non-communicable diseases (e.g., coronary heart disease, Type II diabetes, obesity, stroke, metabolic syndrome and other cholesterol maladies) [2]. To complicate this matter, concerns over sustainability severely limit the use of some fats. This is the case of palm oil and other tropical oils, whose increased production has led to deforestation throughout the world's tropical regions with consequent environmental issues [3].
   Oleogels and oleogelation methodologies were the topics of the webinar organized by the Societa Italiana per lo Studio delle Sostanze Grasse (SISSG) on the 20th of October 2021. The contents of the webinar are here briefly summarized.

TI  - Geological and terrain attributes for predicting soil classes using pixel- and geographic object-based image analysis in the Brazilian Cerrado
T2  - GEODERMA
AB  - One of the great challenges in the geosciences is mapping targets and phenomena that are not fully in direct range of imaging instruments such as remote sensors. Thus, soil maps are still scarce, especially at the detail level for large regions, with the few official maps being restricted to small spatial cutouts, resulting in an increasing demand for pedological information. The aim of this work was to analyze the use of covariates related to geological and terrain attributes on the performance of soil class predictive models for digital soil mapping with pixel- and geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) approaches in the context of sub-humid tropical environments of the Cerrado biome, in central-western Brazil, to reproduce a conventional map. A reference soil map at the scale 1:50,000 with twelve soil classes was used. Randomly stratified samples and the Random Forest (RF) classifier was performed with seventeen digital elevation model derivatives and the geology categorical data (lithostratigraphic units) as covariates for the prediction of soil classes in both approaches. The main results demonstrated that GEOBIA is a promising method for mapping soil classes, with overall accuracy of 0.70, which is 5% higher than pixel-based. The most important covariates for soil class mapping were related to Geology and terrain attributes: Altitude, Vertical Distance to Channel Network, Vector Terrain Ruggedness, Relative Slope Position, Topographic Height, Profile Curvature, Roughness, Slope, and Valley Depth. The integration of the geological covariate improved the models in both approaches. Integrated evaluation of the geological units and terrain attributes along with the use of machine learning techniques, such as the RF algorithm, is a promising and relevant strategy for digital predictive mapping of soil classes that can contribute toward the greater reproducibility of conventional soil maps.

TI  - First report on the seroprevalence of the Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus, a tick-borne virus, in Malaysia's Orang Asli population
T2  - EUROPEAN REVIEW FOR MEDICAL AND PHARMACOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), which is transmitted by the ticks of Hyalomma spp. in general and H. marginatumin particular, can cause severe disease in humans, with mortality rates of 3-30%. Other than from the bites of infected ticks, CCHFV can also be transmitted through contact with patients with the acute phase of infection or contact with blood or tissues from viraemic livestock. Outbreaks of human cases of haemorrhagic manifestations have been documented since 1945 and described in parts of Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe and the Middle East and most recently India in 2011. In addition, serological evidence of the disease has been reported in some countries where no human cases were reported. As regional neighbours China and India have been affected by this virus, this study was conducted to determine the seroprevalence of CCHFV among Orang Asli population of Malaysia as the most at risk people who residing in the deep forests.
   PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 682 serum samples were collected from the Orang Asli population residing in eight states in peninsular Malaysia and analysed for the presence of anti-CCHFV immunoglobulin G (IgG) using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit.
   RESULTS: The study subjects comprised 277 (40.6%) men and 405 (59.4%) women. However, anti-CCHFV IgG was detected in only one female serum sample (0.1%). The presence of anti-CCHFV IgG could not be correlated to age or sex from these findings.
   CONCLUSIONS: The results of this screening survey showed that the seroprevalence of the anti-CCHFV IgG among Malaysia's Orang Asli population is too low for detection or totally negative compared with that in neighbouring countries, such as India and China.

TI  - The Movement of Pathogen Carrying Flies at the Human-Wildlife Interface
T2  - ECOHEALTH
AB  - Flies form high-density associations with human settlements and groups of nonhuman primates and are implicated in transmitting pathogens. We investigate the movement of nonhuman primate-associated flies across landscapes surrounding Kibale National Park, Uganda, using a mark-recapture experiment. Flies were marked in nine nonhuman primate groups at the forest edge ((x) = 929 flies per group), and we then attempted to recapture them in more anthropized areas (50 m, 200 m and 500 m from where marked; 2-21 days after marking). Flies marked in nonhuman primate groups were recaptured in human areas (19/28,615 recaptured). Metabarcoding of the flies in nonhuman primate groups revealed the DNA of multiple eukaryotic primate parasites. Taken together, these results demonstrate the potential of flies to serve as vectors between nonhuman primates, livestock and humans at this biodiverse interface.

TI  - Molecular diagnosis of leishmaniasis: Current status and future applications
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Leishmania parasites are the etiological agents of the leishmaniases. The parasites are transmitted to mammals, including humans, by the bite of phlebotomine sand flies and occasionally, by sharing of needles, blood transfusion, and congenital transmission (18). In terms of global burden of disease, the leishmaniases are the third most important vector-borne disease, and it is estimated that worldwide there are an annual 1.5 to 2 million cases, with up to 350 million people at risk of infection and disease.
   Surveillance data indicate that the global number of cases has increased in recent decades, and several important epidemics have been reported (e.g., Sudan and Afghanistan). Such increases can be explained, in part, by improved diagnosis and case notification but are also due to other factors such as inadequate vector or reservoir control; increased detection of disease associated with opportunistic infections (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]/AIDS), urbanization, and deforestation; the emergence of antileishmanial drug resistance; economic hardship; armed conflict; and tourism. Particularly, the latter two factors have led to the increasing observation and management of leishmaniasis patients in clinical practices in areas where this disease is traditionally not endemic in North America and Northern Europe. Thus, more than 600 U.S. soldiers contracted leishmaniasis in Iraq since 2003, most of which were diagnosed and treated at the Walter Read Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C. (28). Similarly, in the United Kingdom the number of travelers with leishmaniasis seen by the Hospital of Tropical Diseases in London has more than quadrupled in the past 10 years (13). Here we critically review current molecular approaches for leishmaniasis diagnosis, primarily focusing on the detection of human disease rather than their applications in the veterinary field.

TI  - Reproductive biology of woody species in Caatinga, a dry forest of northeastern Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
AB  - Studies concerning reproductive biology at the community level have not yet been reported for Caatinga. In this study, we analyzed the flowering phenology, floral longevity, and breeding system of 15 typical woody species in this ecosystem. Flowering occurred mostly during the dry season for ten species. Among dioecious plants, male individuals predominate for two out of three species analyzed. In Maytenus rigida, a gynodioecious species, female individuals predominate in the population: the number of flowers per inflorescence is the same between hermaphrodite (14.0 +/- 4.4) and female (14.8 +/- 4.6) individuals, but significant differences are found with respect to fruit set by hermaphrodite (1.9 +/- 0.9) and pistillate flowers (4.0 +/- 2.4). Self-compatibility occurs in 26.7% of the studied species. whereas 73.3% present obligatory xenogamy. Among self-incompatible species, two have a stylar site of rejection, while self-pollen tubes reach the ovules in five. Late-acting self-incompatibility in Sideroxylon obtusifolium constitutes the first record of this mechanism in Sapotaceae. The majority of the species studied have a lower fruit/flower than seed/ovule ratio. Reproduction of woody plants in this arid ecosystem depends upon biotic vectors that can promote cross-pollination and gene flow. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

CP  - IEEE 9th International Conference on Advanced Computing (IACC)
AB  - Dengue is a disease caused by four types of related viruses transmitted by a mosquito, most commonly Aedes Aegypti. The disease is considered an alarming threat to the health of populations spanning millions of people living in tropical and subtropical areas of the globe where the mosquito thrives. A large number of studies have confirmed that the rise of dengue disease is positively correlated with climate and climatic conditions, specifically, humidity, temperature and precipitation levels. Many of these studies include quantitative models correlating climate variables with the incidence of dengue cases. The quantitative models invite the question: how well would we be able to predict future cases of the disease based on climate variables that are included in weather forecasts? To answer this question we conducted a study on Dengue Forecasting using machine learning, which utilizes climate and dengue data (available to data scientists by US government) to forecast future dengue epidemics. In this research we proposed a novel model twofold linear regression which out perform compare to all previous models. we achieve 19.81 mean absolute error which is minimum as compare to traditional machine learning techniques. Moreover, we have analyzed various neural network, support vector machine, random forest, boosted tree, XGBoost based predictive models and evaluate their performance against proposed method.

TI  - Natural Infection and Vertical Transmission of Zika Virus in Sylvatic Mosquitoes <i>Aedes albopictus</i> and <i>Haemagogus leucocelaenus</i> from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) was recently introduced into the Western Hemisphere, where it is suspected to be transmitted mainly by Aedes aegypti in urban environments. ZIKV represents a public health problem as it has been implicated in congenital microcephaly in South America since 2015. Reports of ZIKV transmission in forested areas of Africa raises the possibility of its dispersal to non-human-modified environments in South America, where it is now endemic. The current study aimed to detect arboviruses in mosquitoes collected from areas with low human interference in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Using a sensitive pan-flavivirus RT-PCR, designed to detect the NS5 region, pools of Ae. albopictus and Haemagogus leucocelaenus, were positive for both ZIKV and yellow fever (YFV). Virus RNA was detected in pools of adult males and females reared from field-collected eggs. Findings presented here suggest natural vertical transmission and infection of ZIKV in Hg. leucocelaenus and Ae. albopitcus in Brazil.

TI  - Isolation and characterization of microsatellite DNA markers in the malaria vector <i>Anopheles nili</i>
T2  - MOLECULAR ECOLOGY NOTES
AB  - The mosquito Anopheles nili is widespread across tropical Africa and appears to be the major vector of malaria in some rural forested areas of central Africa. Here we describe the isolation of 11 microsatellite polymorphic loci from the A. nili genome, displaying a high among-individual diversity (0.58-0.96) in samples from west Africa. Two loci displayed a significant departure from Hardy-Weinberg proportions across all samples, suggesting a substantial frequency of null alleles. The remaining nine loci are good candidates for further genetic studies in this species.

TI  - Resting environments of some Costa Rican mosquitoes
T2  - JOURNAL OF VECTOR ECOLOGY
AB  - The resting sites of tropical American mosquitoes are poorly documented, and the few reports that do exist are largely from opportunistic collections. Since blood-engorged females (used in determining host associations) are more efficiently collected from resting sites than attractive traps, information on resting site utilization has practical value. To investigate differences in the resting sites utilized by tropical mosquitoes, we collected and identified female mosquitoes from one man-made (resting shelter) and three natural (buttress tree roots, hollow trees, and understory vegetation) resting environments at a tropical dry forest location in western Costa Rica. All of the most common species collected demonstrated associations with one or more resting environments. Females of five species (blood-engorged Anopheles albimanus, Uranotaenia apicalis, Uranotaenia lowii, Uranotaenia orthodoxa, and blood-engorged Mansonia titillans) were collected in significantly greater numbers from understory vegetation than other resting environments. Culex erraticus and other members of the subgenus Melanoconion were encountered more often in resting shelters, hollow trees, and buttress roots, while Culex restrictor (blood-engorged) females were associated with hollow trees. Similarity indices indicate that buttress tree roots, hollow trees, and resting shelters are similar with respect to the mosquito communities that utilize them as resting sites, while understory vegetation has a resting fauna that is different than the other environments surveyed here. These results add to the body of information regarding resting sites utilized by tropical American mosquitoes.

TI  - Ebola and Its Global Research Architecture-Need for an Improvement
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - The current Ebola outbreak poses a threat to individual and global public health. Although the disease has been of interest to the scientific community since 1976, an effective vaccination approach is still lacking. This fact questions past global public health strategies, which have not foreseen the possible impact of this infectious disease. To quantify the global research activity in this field, a scientometric investigation was conducted. We analyzed the research output of countries, individual institutions and their collaborative networks. The resulting research architecture indicated that American and European countries played a leading role regarding output activity, citations and multi- and bilateral cooperations. When related to population numbers, African countries, which usually do not dominate the global research in other medical fields, were among the most prolific nations. We conclude that the field of Ebola research is constantly progressing, and the research landscape is influenced by economical and infrastructural factors as well as historical relations between countries and outbreak events.

TI  - Brazilian <i>Anopheles darlingi</i> Root (Diptera: Culicidae) Clusters by Major Biogeographical Region
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - The major drivers of the extensive biodiversity of the Neotropics are proposed to be geological and tectonic events together with Pliocene and Pleistocene environmental and climatic change. Geographical barriers represented by the rivers Amazonas/Solimoes, the Andes and the coastal mountain ranges in eastern Brazil have been hypothesized to lead to diversification within the primary malaria vector, Anopheles(Nyssorhynchus) darlingi Root, which primarily inhabits rainforest. To test this biogeographical hypothesis, we analyzed 786 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 12 populations of An. darlingi from across the complex Brazilian landscape. Both model-based (STRUCTURE) and non-model-based (Principal Components and Discriminant Analysis) analysis of population structure detected three major genetic clusters that correspond with newly described Neotropical biogeographical regions: 1) Atlantic Forest province (= southeast population); 2) Parana Forest province (= West Atlantic forest population, with one Chacoan population -SP); and 3) Brazilian dominion population (= Amazonian population with one Chacoan population -TO). Significant levels of pairwise genetic divergences were found among the three clusters, allele sharing among clusters was negligible, and geographical distance did not contribute to differentiation. We infer that the Atlantic forest coastal mountain range limited dispersal between the Atlantic Forest province and the Parana Forest province populations, and that the large, diagonal open vegetation region of the Chacoan dominion dramatically reduced dispersal between the Parana and Brazilian dominion populations. We hypothesize that the three genetic clusters may represent three putative species.

TI  - Improving Landslide Detection from Airborne Laser Scanning Data Using Optimized Dempster-Shafer
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - A detailed and state-of-the-art landslide inventory map including precise landslide location is greatly required for landslide susceptibility, hazard, and risk assessments. Traditional techniques employed for landslide detection in tropical regions include field surveys, synthetic aperture radar techniques, and optical remote sensing. However, these techniques are time consuming and costly. Furthermore, complications arise for the generation of accurate landslide location maps in these regions due to dense vegetation in tropical forests. Given its ability to penetrate vegetation cover, high-resolution airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) is typically employed to generate accurate landslide maps. The object-based technique generally consists of many homogeneous pixels grouped together in a meaningful way through image segmentation. In this paper, in order to address the limitations of this approach, the final decision is executed using Dempster-Shafer theory (DST) rule combination based on probabilistic output from object-based support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifiers. Therefore, this research proposes an efficient framework by combining three object-based classifiers using the DST method. Consequently, an existing supervised approach (i.e., fuzzy-based segmentation parameter optimizer) was adopted to optimize multiresolution segmentation parameters such as scale, shape, and compactness. Subsequently, a correlation-based feature selection (CFS) algorithm was employed to select the relevant features. Two study sites were selected to implement the method of landslide detection and evaluation of the proposed method (subset "A" for implementation and subset "B" for the transferrable). The DST method performed well in detecting landslide locations in tropical regions such as Malaysia, with potential applications in other similarly vegetated regions.

TI  - Geographic information system-aided analysis of factors associated with the spatial distribution of <i>Echinococcus multilocularis</i> infections of foxes
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - To investigate the influence of environmental factors on the spatial epidemiology of infections with Echinococcus multilocularis, foxes were sampled in a focal endemic region in the Northwest of Brandenburg, Germany, and examined for infection by the parasite. The locations where foxes were obtained were recorded in a geographic information system database. Positions of infected and uninfected foxes were analyzed on the background of geographic vector data of water, settlements, streets, forests, crop, and pasture. Fox positions were allocated to different land-use classes by use of a Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) satellite image. Infected foxes were more frequently shot near water, in areas of high soil humidity, and on pastures, suggesting that dryness may limit the tenacity of E. multilocularis oncospheres. Thus open landscapes with humid soil seem to be favorable for the life cycle of the parasite. In contrast, infected foxes were significantly underrepresented in forest areas.

TI  - Mapping potential risk of Rift Valley fever outbreaks in African savannas using vegetation index time series data
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Rift Valley fever (RVF) outbreaks in East Africa are closely coupled with above normal rainfall that is associated with the occurrence of the warm phase of the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon. Outbreaks elsewhere in central and southern Africa are also linked to elevated rainfall patterns. Major RVF activity has been reported to occur throughout much of sub-Saharan Africa, except in areas with extensive tropical forest, In this study we used normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time-series data derived from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) instrument on polar orbiting National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) satellites to map areas with a potential for an RVF outbreak. A 19-year NDVI climatology was created and used to discriminate between areas with tropical forest, savanna, and desert. Because most RVF outbreaks have occurred in regions dominated by savanna vegetation, we created a mask to identify those areas where RVF would likely occur within the savanna ecosystems. NDVI anomalies were then calculated for the entire time Series from July 1981 to the July 2000. Subsequently, we developed a methodology that detects areas with persistent positive NDVI anomalies (greater than + 0.1 NDVI units) using a three-month moving window to flag regions at greatest risk. Algorithms were designed to account for periods of extended above normal NDVI (by inference rainfall) and to consider the complex life cycle of mosquitoes that maintain and transmit RVF virus to domestic animals and people. We present results for different ENSO warm- and cold-event periods. The results indicate that regions of potential outbreaks have occurred predominantly during warm ENSO events in East Africa and during cold ENSO events in southern Africa. Results provide a likely historical reconstruction of areas where RVF may have occurred during the last 19 years. There is a close agreement between confirmed outbreaks between 1981 and 2000, particularly in East Africa, and the risk maps produced in this study. This technique is adaptable to near real-time monitoring on a monthly basis and may be a useful tool in RVF disease surveillance.

TI  - Taking the strain out of onchocerciasis? A reanalysis of blindness and transmission data does not support the existence of a savannah blinding strain of onchocerciasis in West Africa
T2  - ADVANCES IN PARASITOLOGY, VOL 112
AB  - Onchocerciasis (also known as `river blindness'), is a neglected tropical disease (NTD) caused by the (Simulium-transmitted) filarial nematode Onchocerca volvulus. The occurrence of `blinding' (savannah) and non-blinding (forest) parasite strains and the existence of corresponding, locally adapted Onchocerca-Simulium complexes were postulated to explain greater blindness prevalence in savannah than in forest foci. As a result, the World Health Organization (WHO) Onchocerciasis Control Programme in West Africa (OCP) focused anti-vectorial and anti-parasitic interventions in savannah endemic areas. In this paper, village-level data on blindness prevalence, microfilarial prevalence, and transmission intensity (measured by the annual transmission potential, the number of infective, L3, larvae per person per year) were extracted from 16 West-Central Africa-based publications, and analysed according to habitat (forest, forest-savannah mosaic, savannah) to test the dichotomous strain hypothesis in relation to blindness. When adjusting for sample size, there were no statistically significant differences in blindness prevalence between the habitats (one-way ANOVA, P = 0.68, mean prevalence for forest = 1.76 +/- 0.37 (SE); mosaic = 1.49 +/- 0.38; savannah = 1.89 +/- 0.26). The well-known relationship between blindness prevalence and annual transmission potential for savannah habitats was confirmed and shown to hold for (but not to be statistically different from) forest foci (excluding data from southern Cote d'Ivoire, in which blindness prevalence was significantly lower than in other West African forest communities, but which had been the focus of studies leading to the strain-blindness hypothesis that was accepted by OCP planners). We conclude that the evidence for a savannah blinding onchocerciasis strain in simple contrast with a non-blinding forest strain is equivocal. A re-appraisal of the strain hypothesis to explain patterns of ocular disease is needed to improve understanding of onchocerciasis epidemiology and disease burden estimates in the light of the WHO 2030 goals for onchocerciasis.

TI  - Buruli Ulcer Disease and Its Association with Land Cover in Southwestern Ghana
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background Buruli ulcer (BU), one of 17 neglected tropical diseases, is a debilitating skin and soft tissue infection caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans. In tropical Africa, changes in land use and proximity to water have been associated with the disease. This study presents the first analysis of BU at the village level in southwestern Ghana, where prevalence rates are among the highest globally, and explores fine and medium-scale associations with land cover by comparing patterns both within BU clusters and surrounding landscapes.
   Methodology/Principal Findings We obtained 339 hospital-confirmed BU cases in southwestern Ghana between 2007 and 2010. The clusters of BU were identified using spatial scan statistics and the percentages of six land cover classes were calculated based on Landsat and Rapid Eye imagery for each of 154 villages/towns. The association between BU prevalence and each land cover class was calculated using negative binomial regression models. We found that older people had a significantly higher risk for BU after considering population age structure. BU cases were positively associated with the higher percentage of water and grassland surrounding each village, but negatively associated with the percent of urban. The results also showed that BU was clustered in areas with high percentage of mining activity, suggesting that water and mining play an important and potentially interactive role in BU occurrence.
   Conclusions/Significance Our study highlights the importance of multiple land use changes along the Offin River, particularly mining and agriculture, which might be associated with BU disease in southwestern Ghana. Our study is the first to use both medium- and high-resolution imagery to assess these changes. We also show that older populations (>= 60 y) appear to be at higher risk of BU disease than children, once BU data were weighted by population age structures.

TI  - Response of three local chicken ecotypes of Ghana to lentogenic and velogenic Newcastle disease virus challenge
T2  - TROPICAL ANIMAL HEALTH AND PRODUCTION
AB  - This study was carried out to assess the response of three Ghanaian local chicken ecotypes to LaSota (lentogenic) and virulent field strains of Newcastle disease virus (NDV). Local chickens sampled from the Interior Savannah (IS), Forest (FO) and Coastal Savannah (CS) agro-ecological zones were bred and their offspring were challenged with LaSota NDV at 4 weeks of age. The LaSota challenge was replicated four times with different chicken groups. A total of 1438 chicks comprising 509 Coastal Savannah, 518 Forest and 411 Interior Savannah ecotypes were used. Pre- and post-challenge anti-NDV antibody titre levels were determined via ELISA assays. A second trial was conducted by introducing sick birds infected with virulent NDV to a flock of immunologically naive chickens at 4 weeks old. Body weights were measured pre- and post-infection. Sex of the chickens was determined using a molecular method. In both trials, there was no significant difference among ecotypes in body weight and growth rate. In the LaSota trial, anti-NDV antibody titre did not differ by ecotype or sex. However, there was a positive linear relationship between body weight and antibody titre. In the velogenic NDV trial, survivability and lesion scores were similar among the three ecotypes. This study confirms that a relatively high dose of LaSota (NDV) challenge has no undesirable effect on Ghanaian local chicken ecotypes. All three Ghanaian local chicken ecotypes were susceptible to velogenic NDV challenge. Resistance to NDV by Ghanaian local chickens appears to be determined more by the individual's genetic makeup than by their ecotype.

TI  - Investigating <i>Chlamydia trachomatis</i> and Genital <i>Mycoplasma</i> Prevalence and Apoptosis Markers in Infertile and Fertile Couples
T2  - JUNDISHAPUR JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Background: Chlamydia trachomatis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, and Mycoplasma hominis are common sexually transmitted microorganisms.
   Objectives: The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of these microorganisms in infertile couples and the effect of these infections on semen parameters.
   Methods: In this case-control study, samples were collected from 50 infertile couples and 50 fertile women and men. Specimens were examined for the presence of C. trachomatis, M. hominis, and U. urealyticum by culture and PCR. Semen specimens were analyzed for apoptotic markers using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay and Western blot.
   Results: In this study, out of 50 semen specimens from infertile men, U. urealyticum and M. hominis were detected in 14 (28%) and 11 (22%) specimens by PCR, and five (10%) and one (2%) specimens by culture, respectively. C. trachomatis was found in five (10%) samples by PCR. In addition, out of 50 endocervical swabs from infertile women, C. trachomatis was found in seven (14%) specimens by PCR, U. urealyticum and M. hominis were detected in 25 (50%) and four (8%) swabs by PCR, and 13 (26%) and two (4%) by culture, respectively. The Western blot and TUNEL assay demonstrated a significant increase in caspase-3 activation and DNA fragmentation in the semen samples of the infected infertile men compared to uninfected men (6 vs. 1.5; P < 0.05).
   Conclusions: The results demonstrated that C. trachomatis and genital Mycoplasma are widespread among infertile couples, and these infections may lead to decreased semen quality.

TI  - Knowledge and Attitudes Towards Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Among Academic and Community Physicians in Mangalore, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF CANCER EDUCATION
AB  - Cervical cancer is the most common cancer found in Indian women. Two human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines were approved for use in India in 2006; however, neither has become readily accepted. Physician attitudes and recommendations are crucial in the uptake of HPV vaccines among adolescent women in the USA; thus, we ought to investigate provider attitudes and practices related to HPV vaccination in India via a survey administered to 210 Indian physicians. Of the 210 physicians, 46 % were community physicians and 54 % were academic physicians. The correct response to HPV knowledge questions was identified around 50 % of the time in 6/11 questions. Only 47 % of the physicians knew that there was an HPV vaccine approved for use in India. Only 11 % and 15 % of physicians strongly agree that the HPV vaccine will lead to long-lasting immunity and has a safe side effect profile, respectively. A total of 30 % of those surveyed reported that they would recommend the HPV vaccine to their patients, while 73 % agreed that the cost of the HPV vaccine is a major barrier to acceptance. After multivariate analysis, there were two significant variables independently associated with a physician's decision to recommend HPV vaccine. These variables were as follows: "whether the vaccine was freely available from the government sector" and "uncertainty about whether HPV must be persistent to cause cervical cancer vs not." Given the lack of knowledge among practicing physicians in Mangalore, increasing the education about HPV infection and HPV vaccination towards health care providers has the potential to increase vaccine recommendations.

TI  - Evaluation of multifrequency SAR data for estimating tropical above-ground biomass by employing radiative transfer modeling
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
AB  - The retrieval of the biophysical parameters and subsequent estimation of the above-ground biomass (AGB) of vegetation stands are made possible by the simulation of the extinction and scattering components from the canopy layer using vector radiative transfer (VRT) theory-based scattering models. With the use of such a model, this study aims to evaluate and compare the potential of dual-pol, multi-frequency SAR data for estimating above-ground biomass. The data selected for this work are L-band dual polarized (HH/HV) ALOS-2 data, S-band dual polarized (HH/HV) NovaSAR data, and C-band dual polarized (VV/VH) Sentinel-1 data. The two key biophysical parameters, tree height, and trunk radius are retrieved using the proposed methodology, applying the frequencies independently. A general allometric equation with vegetation-specific coefficients is used to estimate the AGB from the retrieved biophysical parameters. The retrieval results are validated using ground truth measurements collected from the study area. The L-band, with the coefficient of determination ( R-2) of 0.73 and the root mean square error (RMSE) of 35.90 t/ha, has the best correlation between the modeled and field AGBs, followed by the S-band with an R-2 of 0.37 and an RMSE of 63.37 t/ ha, and the C-band with an R-2 of 0.25 and an RMSE of 72.32 t/ha. The L-band has yielded improved estimates of AGB in regression analysis as well, with an R2 of 0.48 and an RMSE of 50.02 t/ha, compared to the S- and C-bands, which have the R-2 of 0.12 and 0.03 and the RMSE of 70.98 t/ha and 80.84 t/ha, respectively.

TI  - Monkeypoxvirus infections
T2  - REVUE SCIENTIFIQUE ET TECHNIQUE DE L OFFICE INTERNATIONAL DES EPIZOOTIES
AB  - During and after the smallpox eradication campaign, human cases of monkeypox appeared in West and Central Africa, as isolated cases or as small epidemics, Since inter-human transmission has never or only very exceptionally been documented, monkeypox does not represent a serious threat to humans. The virus reservoir is among tree squirrels living in the tropical rain forests of Africa and humans are infected by hunting, killing and skinning these animals. However, the modernisation of society lessens human contact with the virus reservoir. Since the eradication of smallpox, stocks of variola virus have been maintained; whether these stocks should now be destroyed is a political question, which is seriously compromised by mistrust between countries.

TI  - Bushpig (<i>Potamochoerus larvatus</i>) Hunting in Rural Areas of Madagascar and Its Health and Socioeconomic Implications
T2  - FRONTIERS IN CONSERVATION SCIENCE
AB  - Bushmeat consumption and trade plays a relevant role in many tropical countries as a source of protein and income for rural populations. In Madagascar, rural populations depend heavily on natural resources and wildlife as source of income and protein. The bushpig (Potamochoerus larvatus) is the largest mammal available in the island and regularly hunted. However, little is known about the importance and characteristics of this activity and its implication as a potential source of pathogens for both humans and domestic animals. A cross-sectional study was conducted in 2014-2015 in five different regions of rural Madagascar suspected to have significant bushpig populations to (i) quantify and characterize the importance of bushpig hunting, (ii) assess the socioeconomic impact of bushpig trade, (iii) evaluate the potential pathogen transmission between bushpigs, domestic pigs and humans. A total of 77 hunters, 10 butchers and 95 pig farmers were individually interviewed. Hunting seasonality and the perception of local hunters with regards to the dynamics of bushpig populations in the last decade differed between the tropical dry and tropical sub-arid climatic zones. The top reason for hunting bushpigs was crop protection but personal consumption and selling of meat were also common. Hunting efficacy was largely dependent on the technique used. Snares and traps, the most widely used techniques, allowed the majority of hunters to catch from one to 10 bushpigs per year. Limited commercial bushpig trade was observed with only 0.8 bushpig sold in average per year and per hunter, representing a 16 USD income. The average price per kilo sold was USD 0.8 and the average profit received by each butcher/collector after the sale of a carcass was USD 11.9. No perception of disease risks nor precautions were taken to prevent potential pathogen transmission from bushpig to humans or pigs. Most of the hunters (68%) indicated that they had never seen a diseased bushpig. Bushpig hunting in our study areas in Madagascar was basically a small-scale subsistence hunting, very different from commercial bushmeat hunting described in areas of Central Africa or the Amazon Basin. More research is needed to verify the sustainability of bushpig hunting and its potential role in terms of reducing pressure on other endemic wildlife species and transmitting pathogens to humans and pigs.

TI  - Genome Characterization and Pathogenicity of Two New <i>Hyptis pectinata</i> Viruses Transmitted by Distinct Insect Vectors
T2  - PHYTOPATHOLOGY
AB  - Two newly described viruses belonging to distinct families, Rhabdoviridae and Geminiviridae, were discovered co-infecting Hyptis pectinata from a tropical dry forest of Ecuador. The negative-sense RNA genome of the rhabdovirus, tentatively named Hyptis latent virus (HpLV), comprises 13,765 nucleotides with seven open reading frames separated by the conserved intergenic region 3 '-AAUUAUUUUGAU-5 '. Sequence analyses showed identities as high as 56% for the polymerase and 38% for the nucleocapsid to members of the genus Cytorhabdovirus. Efficient transmission of HpLV was mediated by the pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum) in a persistent replicative manner. The single-stranded DNA genome of the virus tentatively named Hyptis golden mosaic virus (HpGMV) shared homology with members of the genus Begomovirus with bipartite genomes. The DNA-A component consists of 2,716 nucleotides (nt), whereas the DNA-B component contains 2,666 nt. Pairwise alignments using the complete genomic sequence of DNA-A of HpGMV and closest relatives showed identities below the cutoff (<91% shared nt) established by the ICTV as species demarcation, indicating that HpGMV should be classified in a distinct begomovirus species. Transmission experiments confirmed that the whitefly Bemisia tabaci Middle East-Asia Minor 1 (MEAM1) is a vector of HpGMV.

TI  - Declining Prevalence of Disease Vectors Under Climate Change
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - More than half of the world population is at risk of vector-borne diseases including dengue fever, chikungunya, zika, yellow fever, leishmaniasis, chagas disease, and malaria, with highest incidences in tropical regions. In Ecuador, vector-borne diseases are present from coastal and Amazonian regions to the Andes Mountains; however, a detailed characterization of the distribution of their vectors has never been carried out. We estimate the distribution of 14 vectors of the above vector-borne diseases under present-day and future climates. Our results consistently suggest that climate warming is likely threatening some vector species with extinction, locally or completely. These results suggest that climate change could reduce the burden of specific vector species. Other vector species are likely to shift and constrain their geographic range to the highlands in Ecuador potentially affecting novel areas and populations. These forecasts show the need for development of early prevention strategies for vector species currently absent in areas projected as suitable under future climate conditions. Informed interventions could reduce the risk of human exposure to vector species with distributional shifts, in response to current and future climate changes. Based on the mixed effects of future climate on human exposure to disease vectors, we argue that research on vector-borne diseases should be cross-scale and include climatic, demographic, and landscape factors, as well as forces facilitating disease transmission at fine scales.

TI  - Burden of Norovirus and Rotavirus in Children after Rotavirus Vaccine Introduction, Cochabamba, Bolivia
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - The effectiveness of rotavirus vaccine in the field may set the stage for a changing landscape of diarrheal illness affecting children worldwide. Norovirus and rotavirus are the two major viral enteropathogens of childhood. This study describes the prevalence of norovirus and rotavirus 2 years after widespread rotavirus vaccination in Cochabamba, Bolivia. Stool samples from hospitalized children with acute gastroenteritis (AGE) and outpatients aged 5-24 months without AGE were recruited from an urban hospital serving Bolivia's third largest city. Both viruses were genotyped, and norovirus GII.4 was further sequenced. Norovirus was found much more frequently than rotavirus. Norovirus was detected in 69/201 (34.3%) of specimens from children with AGE and 13/71 (18.3%) of those without diarrhea. Rotavirus was detected in 38/201 (18.9%) of diarrheal specimens and 3/71 (4.2%) of non-diarrheal specimens. Norovirus GII was identified in 97.8% of norovirus-positive samples; GII.4 was the most common genotype (71.4% of typed specimens). Rotavirus G3P[8] was the most prevalent rotavirus genotype (44.0% of typed specimens) and G2P[4] was second most prevalent (16.0% of typed specimens). This community is likely part of a trend toward norovirus predominance over rotavirus in children after widespread vaccination against rotavirus.

TI  - Analysis of pig trading networks and practices in Uganda
T2  - TROPICAL ANIMAL HEALTH AND PRODUCTION
AB  - East Africa is undergoing rapid expansion of pig rearing, driven by increasing pork consumption. Introduction and expansion of pig production systems in this biodiverse landscape may create new risks, including zoonotic pathogen transmission. Historically, biosecurity measures have primarily been focused at farm level, ignoring the important function pig traders fulfill between farmers and consumers. This study interviewed pig traders operating at Uganda's only registered pork abattoir to describe their characteristics, business practices, biosecurity practices, and pig health management and reporting practices. All the traders were male, and nearly all (90.5%) relied on pig trading as their primary source of income. Most of the pigs brought for processing at the slaughterhouse were purchased from smallholder farms (87.3%). In addition, there was a significant difference in the high price paid per kilogram at farm gate by region (P=0.005). High prices paid at farm gate were associated with holiday periods (P<0.001), harvest season (P<0.001), and drought (P<0.001). Traders preferred buying live pigs from male farmers (88.9%) because they were considered the final decision makers and owned the pigs being sold. All pig traders were aware of clinical signs indicating a pig was sick. This study has provided baseline information on pig trader practices in Uganda. Improvements in local pork slaughterhouses and markets will benefit not only pig traders in accessing consistent customers but also individual pig farmers by increasing their market access. Finally, given their role as a link between farmers and consumers, traders would benefit from targeted inclusion in disease control and prevention strategies.

TI  - Bacterial profiling of head lice isolated from the Orang Asli: A first report in Malaysia
T2  - TROPICAL BIOMEDICINE
AB  - This study was carried out to determine from bacterial profiling to the bacterial profiles of head lice among the Orang Asli communities. The head lice were collected from Orang Ash community volunteers. The surface sterilized head lice pools were subjected to genomic DNA extraction while next generation sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene was performed using the Illumina MiSeq platform. Six female and three male head lice identified as Pediculus humanus capitis were collected. A total of 111 368 number of NGS sequencing reads were recorded while another 223 bacterial taxa sequences were obtained. Symbiotic bacteria showed the highest number of reads, with Arsenaphanus and Rhodococcus sequences being the most abundant genera in the female and male samples, respectively. The female head lice contained a more distinct microbial diversity. Amongst the pathogenic bacterial species sequences noted were the inethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Streptobacillus moniliformis, Haemophilus influenzac, Bordetella pertussis and Acinetobacter baumannii. The 16S rRNA genome sequencing revealed a number of rare and pathogenic bacterial species within the head lice of the Orang Ash. The socio-economic practices of the community which involved forest foraging and hunting, and their poor living conditions potentially facilitated the transmission of zoonotic bacterial pathogens, including those found within the head lice. Hence, there is the possibility that the head lice could serve as vectors for the transmission of pathogenic bacteria. This study highlighted the diverse microbial community found within the head lice's gut of the Orang Asli, with the detection of multiple rare and pathogenic bacteria capable of causing severe infections.

TI  - Contrasting sylvatic foci of Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus in northern south America
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - The ecology of Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) virus transmission was compared at three enzootic foci: two forest sites in the Catatumbo region of western Venezuela that have yielded small numbers of virus isolates since the 1970s, and another focus in the middle Magdalena Valley of Colombia that has consistently yielded many VEE virus isolates. Our results demonstrated dramatic differences in VEE virus isolation rates from sentinel hamsters, as well as differences in mosquito species composition and captured mammals with antibodies to VEE virus. between the Colombian and Venezuelan study sites. The higher isolation rate of enzootic VEE virus in the Colombian site was associated with a more abundant fauna of spiny rats (Proechimys spp,), known reservoir hosts of enzootic VEE virus, Mosquito collections demonstrated that the Colombian forest had a higher mosquito diversify and species evenness than either of the Venezuelan forests. The Colombian focus was especially richer in its Culex (Melanoconion) spp, fauna. a subgenus that includes all proven enzootic vectors for VEE virus. Our results suggest that the greater abundance. diversity, and stability of enzootic vector populations combined with the greater density (if rodent reservoir hosts, explains the higher levels of VEE virus circulation in the Colombian focus compared with the Venezuelan forests.

TI  - Savanna responses to feral buffalo in Kakadu National Park, Australia
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS
AB  - Savannas are the major biome of tropical regions, spanning 30% of the Earth's land surface. Tree: grass ratios of savannas are inherently unstable and can be shifted easily by changes in fire, grazing, or climate. We synthesize the history and ecological impacts of the rapid expansion and eradication of an exotic large herbivore, the Asian water buffalo (Bubalus bubalus), on the mesic savannas of Kakadu National Park (KNP), a World Heritage Park located within the Alligator Rivers Region (ARR) of monsoonal north Australia. The study inverts the experience of the Serengeti savannas where grazing herds rapidly declined due to a rinderpest epidemic and then recovered upon disease control. Buffalo entered the ARR by the 1880s, but densities were low until the late 1950s when populations rapidly grew to carrying capacity within a decade. In the 1980s, numbers declined precipitously due to an eradication program. We show evidence that the rapid population expansion and Sudden removal of this exotic herbivore created two ecological cascades by altering around cover abundance and composition, which in turn affected competitive regimes and fuel loads with possible further, long-term effects due to changes in fire regimes. Overall, ecological impacts varied across a north-south gradient in KNP that corresponded to the interacting factors of precipitation, landform, and vegetation type but was also contingent upon the history of buffalo harvest. Floodplains showed the greatest degree of impact during the period of rapid buffalo expansion, but after buffalo removal, they largely reverted to their prior state. Conversely, the woodlands experienced less visible impact during the first cascade. However, in areas of low buffalo harvest and severe impact, there was little recruitment of juvenile trees into the canopy due to the indirect effects of grazing and high frequency of prescribed fires once buffalo were removed. Rain forests were clearly heavily impacted during the first cascade, but the long term consequences of buffalo increase and removal remain unclear. Due to hysteresis effects, the simple removal of an exotic herbivore was not sufficient to return savanna systems to their previous state.

TI  - Modelling the impact of larviciding on the population dynamics and biting rates of <i>Simulium</i> <i>damnosum</i> (<i>s.l.</i>): implications for vector control as a complementary strategy for onchocerciasis elimination in Africa
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
AB  - Background: In 2012, the World Health Organization set goals for the elimination of onchocerciasis transmission by 2020 in selected African countries. Epidemiological data and mathematical modelling have indicated that elimination may not be achieved with annual ivermectin distribution in all endemic foci. Complementary and alternative treatment strategies (ATS), including vector control, will be necessary. Implementation of vector control will require that the ecology and population dynamics of Simulium damnosum (sensu lato) be carefully considered.
   Methods: We adapted our previous SIMuliid POPulation dynamics (SIMPOP) model to explore the impact of larvicidal insecticides on S. damnosum (s.l.) biting rates in different ecological contexts and to identify how frequently and for how long vector control should be continued to sustain substantive reductions in vector biting. SIMPOP was fitted to data from large-scale aerial larviciding trials in savannah sites (Ghana) and small-scale ground larviciding trials in forest areas (Cameroon). The model was validated against independent data from Burkina Faso/Cote d'Ivoire (savannah) and Bioko (forest). Scenario analysis explored the effects of ecological and programmatic factors such as pre-control daily biting rate (DBR) and larviciding scheme design on reductions and resurgences in biting rates.
   Results: The estimated efficacy of large-scale aerial larviciding in the savannah was greater than that of ground-based larviciding in the forest. Small changes in larvicidal efficacy can have large impacts on intervention success. At 93% larvicidal efficacy (a realistic value based on field trials), 10 consecutive weekly larvicidal treatments would reduce DBRs by 96% (e.g. from 400 to 16 bites/person/day). At 70% efficacy, and for 10 weekly applications, the DBR would decrease by 67% (e.g. from 400 to 132 bites/person/day). Larviciding is more likely to succeed in areas with lower water temperatures and where blackfly species have longer gonotrophic cycles.
   Conclusions: Focal vector control can reduce vector biting rates in settings where a high larvicidal efficacy can be achieved and an appropriate duration and frequency of larviciding can be ensured. Future work linking SIMPOP with onchocerciasis transmission models will permit evaluation of the impact of combined anti-vectorial and anti-parasitic interventions on accelerating elimination of the disease.

TI  - Is the chimpanzee, <i>Pan troglodytes</i> an endangered species?: It depends on what "endangered" means
T2  - PRIMATES
CP  - International Symposium on African Great Apes - Evolution, Diversity and Conservation
AB  - I review information on the status in the wild of the robust chimpanzee, Pan troglodytes, and consider whether this evidence is consistent with the designation of P. troglodytes as Endangered in the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) Red List, and with public statements to the effect that great apes as a whole will be extinct within a few decades. Chimpanzees remain widespread in tropical Africa, occurring in a variety of forested habitats. Estimates of total surviving numbers have increased from about 200,000 in the 1980s to a maximum of almost 300,000 in 2003. However, this apparent increase comes about from new survey data, rather than representing a measured increase in actual population numbers. Infectious disease decimated several chimpanzee populations during the 1990s, and data from parts of Gabon, extrapolated to that country as a whole, suggest a major decline in great ape populations caused by disease and hunting. However, accurate data on population numbers are absent for the majority of wild chimpanzee Populations. I found reports of the presence of Pan troglodytes in at least 51 national parks in at least 19 countries; some of these parks have been established very recently. Chimpanzees also occur in many non-park conservation areas. A set of large, well-protected parks could safeguard chimpanzees for the foreseeable future. Although many African parks do not function well at present, mechanisms to improve their function are understood and available. By a strict application of IUCN threat criteria, P. troglodytes can be considered Endangered, based on estimated rates of past decline and on the species' long generation time. Relatively speaking, however, P. troglodytes is less endangered than are orangutans or gorillas, and the species is unlikely to go extinct by the year 2100, especially if existing conservation measures improve. The IUCN threat-rating system has become overly complex; the system can produce results that do not accord with common sense and these results must therefore be interpreted with care.
