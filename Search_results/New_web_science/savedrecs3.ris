TI  - Enzootic frog pathogen <i>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</i> in Asian tropics reveals high ITS haplotype diversity and low prevalence
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Emerging Infectious Diseases (EIDs) are a major threat to wildlife and a key player in the declining amphibian populations worldwide. One such EID is chytridiomycosis caused by Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), a fungal pathogen. Aetiology of Bd infection is poorly known from tropical frogs in Asian biodiversity hotspots. Surveys were carried out in four biodiversity hotspots to ascertain the status of Bd fungus. We collected a total of 1870 swab samples from frogs representing 32 genera and 111 species. Nested PCRs revealed low prevalence (8.4%) and high Bd haplotype richness was revealed after sequencing. We document 57 Bd Internal Transcribed Spacer region (ITS) haplotypes, of which 46 were unique to the global database. Bd ITS region showed indels at the Taqman binding site and qPCR reverse primer binding site, suggesting qPCR is unsuitable for diagnosis in Asian Bd coldspots. Our median-joining network and Bayesian tree analyses reveal that the Asian haplotypes, with the exception of Korea, formed a separate clade along with pandemic BdGPL (Bd Global Panzootic Lineage) haplotype. We hypothesise that the frog populations in Asian tropics might harbour several endemic strains of Bd, and the high levels of diversity and uniqueness of Bd haplotypes in the region, probably resulted from historical host-pathogen co-evolution.

TI  - Seed dispersal, spatial distribution and population structure of Brazilnut trees (Bertholletia excelsa) in southeastern Amazonia
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY
AB  - Seeds of the Brazilnut tree (Bertholletia excelsa Humb. & Bonpl., Lecythidaceae) sustain one of the most important extractive industries in neotropical forests. Yet little is known about the demography and seed dispersal ecology of Bertholletia, particularly in natural stands which have not been previously harvested. This study presents data on the population density, spatial distribution, and seed dispersal ecology of Brazilnut trees at a pristine stand located within the Kayapo Indian Area of southeastern Amazonia, Parb, Brazil. Brazilnut trees were primarily found within groves (castanhais) of 75 to 149 trees, with a few isolated trees in between. Although the density of trees greater than or equal to 10 cm in diameter at breast height (hereafter, dbh) at two groves was 4.8 to 5.1 trees ha(-1), the overall density for the entire study area of c. 950 ha was estimated at 1.3 tree ha(-1). Within-grove nearest neighbour distances averaged 21 m and were markedly skewed towards even shorter distances. Seed dispersal experiments using 709 marked seeds indicated that this pattern can be largely explained by the highly restricted seed shadows imparted by the main seed dispersal agents of Bertholletia at this site, the red-rumped agouti (Dasyprocta leporina). Agoutis on average scatterhoard Bertholletia seeds to an average distance of 5 m, and rarely beyond 20 m, from seed stations. We suggest that, once edaphic and climatic conditions are suitable, the highly contagious spatial distribution of Bertholletia trees at the landscape level can be largely accounted for by the quantitatively dominant effect of short-distance dispersal by caviomorph rodents, and rare events of long-distance dispersal provided by other vectors. This mechanism of grove formation need not resort to untested conjectures of human dispersal and intentional planting in prehistoric and historic times as it has often been suggested in the literature.

TI  - Digital Earth in support of global change research
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
AB  - The Digital Earth concept as originally proposed by former US Vice president Al Gore is now well established and widely adopted internationally. Similarly, many researchers world-wide are studying the causes, effects and impacts of Global Change. The authors commence by describing a five-step approach to the development of Digital Earth technologies. This is followed by a detailed account of Digital Earth research and developments in China. The authors then present the research results of Global Change studies carried out in China, based on the Digital Earth approach. These research results are based on a classification of global change regions. This covers the following global change situations:
   Forest and grassland fires in Northern China, temperate region desertification and dust storms, underground coal fires, deforestation and carbon sequestration, protection and utilisation of wetlands, Avian Influenza and the spread of diseases, Tibet Plateau uplift and sub-tropical monsoon climate region, and sea-level rise. The research results show that the environment does not behave in a way easily understood by the traditional disciplinary approach. Although man is clearly a contributing factor to certain Global Change aspects, such as underground coal fires, desertification, land use changes etc., many of the aspects of Global Change are naturally occurring phenomena which have been changing over centuries, and will continue to do so, no matter what actions we undertake to reverse these processes. Hence, in their conclusions, the authors propose that the communities involved in Digital Earth modelling and in Global Change research co-operate closer to overcome the limitations inherent in the current 'conventional' scientific approach, where scientists have very much stayed within their respective scientific boundaries. Such an integrated approach will enable us to build the next level of scientific infrastructure required to understand and predict naturally occurring environmental changes, as well as that of coupled human-environmental systems.

TI  - Could Airborne Geophysical Data Be Used to Improve Predictive Modeling of Agronomic Soil Properties in Tropical Hillslope Area?
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Airborne geophysical data (AGD) have great potential to represent soil-forming factors. Because of that, the objective of this study was to evaluate the importance of AGD in predicting soil attributes such as aluminum saturation (ASat), base saturation (BS), cation exchange capacity (CEC), clay, and organic carbon (OC). The AGD predictor variables include total count (& mu;R/h), K (potassium), eU (uranium equivalent), and eTh (thorium equivalent), ratios between these elements (eTh/K, eU/K, and eU/eTh), factor F or F-parameter, anomalous potassium (Kd), anomalous uranium (Ud), anomalous magnetic field (AMF), vertical derivative (GZ), horizontal derivatives (GX and GY), and mafic index (MI). The approach was based on applying predictive modeling techniques using (1) digital elevation model (DEM) covariates and Sentinel-2 images with AGD; and (2) DEM covariates and Sentinel-2 images without the AGD. The study was conducted in Bom Jardim, a county in Rio de Janeiro-Brazil with an area of 382,430 km(2), with a database of 208 soil samples to a predefined depth (0-30 cm). Non-explanatory covariates for the selected soil attributes were excluded. Through the selected covariables, the random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) models were applied with separate samples for training (75%) and validation (25%). The model's performance was evaluated through the R-squared (R-2), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE), as well as null model values and coefficient of variation (CV%). The RF algorithm showed better performance with AGD (R-2 values ranging from 0.15 to 0.23), as well as the SVM model (R-2 values ranging from 0.08 to 0.23) when compared to RF (R-2 values ranging from 0.10 to 0.20) and SVM (R-2 values ranging from 0.04 to 0.10) models without AGD. Overall, the results suggest that AGD can be helpful for soil mapping. Nevertheless, it is crucial to acknowledge that the accuracy of AGD in predicting soil properties could vary depending on various common factors in DSM, such as the quality and resolution of the covariates and available soil data. Further research is needed to determine the optimal approach for using AGD in soil mapping.

TI  - Nursery fertilization of <i>Pithecellobium dulce</i> (Roxb.) Benth: effects on seedling quality
T2  - MADERA Y BOSQUES
AB  - Nursery fertilization is a cultural practice with potential to improve seedling quality, but it is necessary to define adequate fertilization levels for each specie. This study evaluated the effect of fertilization levels on seedling quality of Pithecellobium dulce during the nursery stage. The applicated levels were nine; they consisted in regimes in which a controlled-release fertilizer (CRF) 18-6-12, in three doses (4 g L-1, 6 g L-1, and 8 g L-1 of substrate) was mixed with a water-soluble fertilizer (WSF) 20-20-20, in concentrations of nitrogen of 0 mg L-1, 75 mg L-1, and 150 mg L-1. The fertilization regimes effects were determined by assessing morphological attributes of seedling quality, net assimilation rates (NAR), and nutrimental status of N-P-K on four-month old seedlings. A seedling-quality test was designed to undergo the seedlings to a stress condition of both nutrient's deficiencies and biomass loss, thereby measuring their resprouting capacity and growth. Statistical differences were observed by the effects of the fertilization regimes. Overall, an increase of the morphological quality and NAR was promoted by the mix of 8 g of CRF with 150 mg N L-1 of WSF, although the main responses in relation to the nutrimental status were of deficiency and dilution. In the seedling-quality test, the seedlings had limitations to induce either their resprouting or their growth according to the amount of nutrimental reserves. The fertilization with CRF and WSF have potential to enhance the seedling quality of P. dulce during nursery culture.

TI  - <i>Trypanosoma cruzi</i> TcIII/Z3 genotype as agent of an outbreak of Chagas disease in the Brazilian Western Amazonia
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE & INTERNATIONAL HEALTH
AB  - P>Chagas' disease is an emerging and neglected disease in the Brazilian Amazon region, where T. cruzi I predominates among the acute cases of the disease; and T. cruzi III/Z3, a population cluster from sylvatic areas of the Amazon basin, is rarely associated with human infections. On 23rd April 2007, the Foundation for Health Surveillance of the State of Amazonas, Brazil reported an outbreak of acute Chagas disease in the municipality of Coari on the Solimoes River banks. Fresh blood examination confirmed the infection in 25 patients. Parasite culture in LIT medium was successful for 18 isolates. Molecular characterization was performed by PCR of the non-transcribed spacer of the mini-exon and by sequencing of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit II (COII) gene. The T. cruzi isolates were all from genotype Z3, and sequencing revealed that all isolates had equal COII sequences compatible with TcIII type, suggesting a single source of infection. To our knowledge, this is the first outbreak of acute cases caused uniquely by the genotype TcIII/Z3. Wild vectors harbouring TcIII stocks contribute to transmission when the triatomine species reaches human food chain or when humans invade the forest environment, where sylvatic cycle constitutes a reservoir of parasites that might be associated with specific epidemiological and clinical traits of the emergent Chagas disease in the Amazon.

T2  - MITTEILUNGEN DER DEUTSCHEN GESELLSCHAFT FUR ALLGEMEINE UND ANGEWANDTE ENTOMOLOGIE, BD 20
CP  - Entomology 2015 Conference
AB  - Although commonly referred to as tropical diseases, dengue fever, yellow fever and malaria historically affected numerous European countries, including northern ones, such as Scandinavia, Great Britain and northwestern Russia, when summer conditions were appropriate for vector propagation and allowed extrinsic incubation of the pathogen. While formerly endemic malaria parasites and mosquito vectors (Aedes aegypti) disappeared from Europe in the first half of the 20'h century, imported pathogens and vectors have led to the emergence or resurgence of mosquito-borne diseases long thought to be overcome. Globalisation and climate change nowadays substantially support or facilitate the introduction and spread of pathogens and their vectors. Thus, malaria, dengue, chikungunya, West Nile fever, Usutu virus infection and dirofilariosis have increasingly occurred on the European continent recently while exotic mosquito species, such as the Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, the yellow fever mosquito, Ae. aegypti, and further invasive species with unclear vector competence, such as Aedes japonicus and Aedes koreicus, have (re-)established. As the frequency of cases and outbreaks of mosquito-borne diseases in Europe is expected to keep rising, the ECDC (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control), the WHO (World Health Organization) and the EMCA (European Mosquito Control Association) have put considerable effort in bringing this problem on the European agenda and in preparing guidelines for the surveillance and control of mosquitoes which enables risk assessment and management of mosquito vectors in Europe.

TI  - Unveil the transcriptional landscape at the Cryptococcus-host axis in mice and nonhuman primates
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Pathogens and hosts require rapid modulation of virulence and defense mechanisms at the infection axis, but monitoring such modulations is challenging. In studying the human fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans, mouse and rabbit infection models are often employed to shed light on the disease mechanisms but that may not be clinically relevant. In this study, we developed an animal infection model using the non-human primate cynomolgus monkey Macaca fascicularis. In addition, we systematically profiled and compared transcriptional responses between the infected mice and the cynomolgus monkey, using simultaneous or dual RNA next-generation sequencing. We demonstrated that there are shared but distinct transcriptional profiles between the two models following C. neoformans infection. Specifically, genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses are all upregulated. Osteoclastogenesis and insulin signaling are also significantly co-regulated in both models and disrupting an osteoclastogenesis-associated gene (OC-STAMP) or the insulin-signaling process significantly altered the host tolerance to C. neoformans. Moreover, C. neoformans was shown to activate metal sequestration, dampen the sugar metabolism, and control cell morphology during infection. Taking together, we described the development of a non-human primate model of cryptococcosis that allowed us to perform an in-depth analysis and comparison of transcriptome profiles during infections of two animal models and conceptually identify host genes important in disease responses. This study provides new insights in understanding fungal pathogenesis mechanisms that potentially facilitate the identification of novel drug targets for the treatment of cryptococcal infection.
   Author summary The host-pathogen interaction is highly dynamic and tightly regulated, and yet is difficult to monitor. Traditional investigations provide valuable information for the understanding of pathogenic microbial biology but are time-consuming and often neglect the host immune responses. In addition, current animal models for studying pathogenic fungi are limited in mimicking the responses from humans. The development of a new Cryptococcus neoformans infection model using nonhuman primates and the utilization of simultaneous RNA sequencing analysis provide fast and clinically relevant research data allowing the identification of novel critical players from both the invading fungus and the host. The data from the current study would not only help to decipher disease mechanisms but also promote the discovery of novel antifungal drug targets.

TI  - Domestic low-tech anaerobic digesters in Guin,-Bissau: a bench-scale preliminary study on locally available waste and wastewater
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Solid organic waste (SOW) and sewage (SEW), in developing contexts as Guin,-Bissau, can be converted into biogas in domestic low-tech anaerobic digesters (AD), avoiding their dispersion in the environment (cause of infective diseases) and simultaneously providing local sustainable/clean fuel to substitute firewood (cause of deforestation and respiratory diseases). Here, SOW and SEW, sampled from local markets/households of Bissau City, were processed in a bench-scale reactor, to define the potentials of low-tech mesophilic (30-37 A degrees C) AD in removing pathogen microbial population, responsible for infective diseases spreading through untreated SOW/SEW and in domestic fuel generation in substitution to firewood. Pathogens removal above 99.9 % were obtained for E. coli and Streptococci. Considering a target scenario (4-persons household unit), a low-tech AD of 2.35 m(3) functional volume, co-digesting 32 L day(-1) of SEW and 8 kg day(-1) of SOW, would produce about and substitute nearly 11 kg day(-1) of firewood for cooking needs, avoiding black carbon particles emissions and inhalation in households. Alternatively, ten biogas lamps could work for 3 h day(-1) or a 1-kW electric power generator run for over 2 h day(-1), with important socio-economic benefits. Finally, firewood substitution and the use of digestate as soil conditioner can simultaneously contribute in limiting deforestation and desertification, particularly in transition sub-Saharan tropical areas, such as Guin,-Bissau.

TI  - Banana bunchy top disease in Africa-Predicting continent-wide disease risks by combining survey data and expert knowledge
T2  - PLANT PATHOLOGY
AB  - Across Africa, banana bunchy top disease (BBTD) severely impacts banana production and livelihoods of millions of smallholder farmers. Mapping vulnerability of landscapes to monitor BBTD establishment and spread is crucial for proactive measures of disease exclusion. To highlight current and future risks of BBTD in Africa, the relationship between 1160 field observations from 14 BBTD surveys and environmental covariate maps was determined using logistic regression. From these relationships, we inferred the environmental suitability of the African landscape for the possible wider spread of BBTD. Using this information and expert knowledge, we generated a map highlighting the main banana production areas at risk of BBTD entry and establishment. We combined these maps to create a priority map that highlights the areas that need most attention in combating BBTD through surveillance and measures to prevent its spread. Our analysis shows that BBTD is widespread across tropical Africa, with dispersal over several hotspots. Central and Western Africa are most favourable for the development of BBTD. Central, West and South-East Africa are most at risk of BBTD entry and initial establishment. Areas in West and Central Africa, in the Great Lakes Region in Eastern Africa and in South-East Africa, particularly in Malawi and Mozambique, score high on the prioritization index for surveillance and mitigation efforts. Recent reports of BBTD presence in north-western Uganda and western Tanzania support these risk predictions. For these and other not-yet-infected areas, measures for close surveillance and proactive management of the disease are needed.

TI  - Deep serological profiling of the <i>Trypanosoma cruzi</i> TSSA antigen reveals different epitopes and modes of recognition by Chagas disease patients
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - BackgroundTrypanosoma cruzi, the agent of Chagas disease, displays a highly structured population, with multiple strains that can be grouped into 6-7 evolutionary lineages showing variable eco-epidemiological traits and likely also distinct disease-associated features. Previous works have shown that antibody responses to 'isoforms' of the polymorphic parasite antigen TSSA enable robust and sensitive identification of the infecting strain with near lineage-level resolution. To optimize the serotyping performance of this molecule, we herein used a combination of immunosignaturing approaches based on peptide microarrays and serum samples from Chagas disease patients to establish a deep linear B-cell epitope profiling of TSSA. Methods/Principle findingsOur assays revealed variations in the seroprevalence of TSSA isoforms among Chagas disease populations from different settings, hence strongly supporting the differential distribution of parasite lineages in domestic cycles across the Americas. Alanine scanning mutagenesis and the use of peptides of different lengths allowed us to identify key residues involved in antibody pairing and the presence of three discrete B-cell linear epitopes in TSSAII, the isoform with highest seroprevalence in human infections. Comprehensive screening of parasite genomic repositories led to the discovery of 9 novel T. cruzi TSSA variants and one TSSA sequence from the phylogenetically related bat parasite T. cruzi marinkellei. Further residue permutation analyses enabled the identification of diagnostically relevant or non-relevant substitutions among TSSA natural polymorphisms. Interestingly, T. cruzi marinkellei TSSA displayed specific serorecognition by one chronic Chagas disease patient from Colombia, which warrant further investigations on the diagnostic impact of such atypical TSSA. Conclusions/SignificanceOverall, our findings shed new light into TSSA evolution, epitope landscape and modes of recognition by Chagas disease patients; and have practical implications for the design and/or evaluation of T. cruzi serotyping strategies.
   Author summaryChagas disease, caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, is a chronic, debilitating illness of major significance in Latin America. Due to the extensive genetic and phenotypic variability of this parasite, methods able to reliably assign the infecting strain type are expected to have a positive effect on epidemiologic surveillance, prevention of transmission, and clinical management of Chagas disease. Herein we describe the diversity of human antibody specificities directed to a polymorphic T. cruzi antigen, TSSA, using a combination of bioinformatics and state of the art immunoassays based on peptide arrays. Our results led to the identification of novel variants of the antigen, distinct epitopes, and their key residues for antibody binding across diverse human populations and have practical implications for the design and/or evaluation of T. cruzi serotyping strategies.

TI  - Spatial relationships between above-ground biomass and bird species biodiversity in Palawan, Philippines
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - This study maps distribution and spatial congruence between Above-Ground Biomass (AGB) and species richness of IUCN listed conservation-dependent and endemic avian fauna in Palawan, Philippines. Grey Level Co-Occurrence Texture Matrices (GLCMs) extracted from Landsat and ALOS-PALSAR were used in conjunction with local field data to model and map local-scale field AGB using the Random Forest algorithm (r = 0.92 and RMSE = 31.33 Mg.ha(-1)). A support vector regression (SVR) model was used to identify the factors influencing variation in avian species richness at a 1km scale. AGB is one of the most important determinants of avian species richness for the study area. Topographic factors and anthropogenic factors such as distance from the roads were also found to strongly influence avian species richness. Hotspots of high AGB and high species richness concentration were mapped using hotspot analysis and the overlaps between areas of high AGB and avian species richness was calculated. Results show that the overlaps between areas of high AGB with high IUCN red listed avian species richness and endemic avian species richness were fairly limited at 13% and 8% at the 1-km scale. The overlap between 1) low AGB and low IUCN richness, and 2) low AGB and low endemic avian species richness was higher at 36% and 12% respectively. The enhanced capacity to spatially map the correlation between AGB and avian species richness distribution will further assist the conservation and protection of forest areas and threatened avian species.

TI  - The continental atlas of tsetse and African animal trypanosomosis in Nigeria
T2  - ACTA TROPICA
AB  - Tsetse-transmitted trypanosomosis remains a major animal health problem in Nigeria, in a context where changes in land cover, climate and control interventions are modifying its epidemiological patterns. Evidence-based decision making for the progressive control of the disease requires spatially-explicit information on its occurrence and prevalence, as well as on the distribution and abundance of the tsetse vector.
   In the framework of the continental Atlas of tsetse and African animal trypanosomosis (AAT), a geo-referenced database was assembled for Nigeria, based on the systematic review of 133 scientific publications (period January 1990 - March 2019).
   The three main species of trypanosomes responsible for the disease (i.e. Trypanosoma vivax, T. congolense and T. brucei) were found to be widespread, thus posing a national-level problem. Their geographic distribution extends beyond the tsetse-infested belt, owing to the combined effect of animal movement and mechanical transmission by non-tsetse vectors. T. simiae, the major trypanosomal pathogen in pigs, T. godfreyi and the human-infective T. brucei gambiense were also reported. AAT was reported in a number of susceptible host species, including cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, camels, horses, donkeys and dogs, while no study on wildlife was identified. Estimates of prevalence are heavily influenced by the sensitivity of the diagnostic techniques, ranging from an average of 3.5% for blood films to 31.0% for molecular techniques.
   Two riverine tsetse species (i.e. Glossina palpalis palpalis and G. tachinoides) were found to have the broadest geographical range, as they were detected in all six geopolitical zones of Nigeria. By contrast, the distribution of savannah species (i.e. G. morsitans submorsitans and G. longipalpis) appears to be highly fragmented, and limited to protected areas. Very little information is available for forest species, with one single paper reporting on G. fusca congolensis and G. nigrofusca nigrofusca in the Niger Delta region.
   The future development of a national Atlas of tsetse and AAT, relying on both published and unpublished information, could improve on the present review and provide further epidemiological evidence for decision making.

TI  - A Study on the Distribution Pattern of Banana Blood Disease (BBD) and Fusarium Wilt Using Multispectral Aerial Photos and a Handheld Spectrometer in Subang, Indonesia
T2  - DIVERSITY-BASEL
AB  - Knowledge of the health of banana trees is critical for farmers in order to profit from banana cultivation. Fusarium wilt and banana blood disease (BBD), two significant diseases that infect banana trees, are caused by Fusarium oxysporum and Ralstonia syzygii, respectively. They have caused a decline in crop yield, as they destroy trees, starting sequentially from the pseudostem to the fruit. The entire distribution of BBD and fusarium on a plantation can be understood using advanced geospatial information obtained from multispectral aerial photographs taken using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and a reliable data field for infected trees. Vegetation and soil indices derived from multispectral aerial photographs, such as the normalized difference vegetation index, the modified chlorophyll absorption ratio index, the normalized difference water index (NDWI), and soil pH, may have to be relied upon to explain the precise location of these two diseases. This study used a random forest algorithm to handle a large dataset consisting of multispectral and spectral models. The results show that the soil indices, soil pH, and NDWI are the most important variables for predicting the spatial distribution of these two diseases. Simultaneously, the plantation area affected by BBD is more extensive than that affected by fusarium if variations in planted banana cultivars are not considered.

TI  - Impact of SARS-CoV-2 Gamma lineage introduction and COVID-19 vaccination on the epidemiological landscape of a Brazilian city
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS MEDICINE
AB  - Background: The emergence of the Brazilian variant of concern, Gamma lineage (P.1), impacted the epidemiological profile of COVID-19 cases due to its higher transmissibility rate and immune evasion ability.
   Methods: We sequenced 305 SARS-CoV-2 whole-genomes and performed phylogenetic analyses to identify introduction events and the circulating lineages. Additionally, we use epidemiological data of COVID-19 cases, severe cases, and deaths to measure the impact of vaccination coverage and mortality risk.
   Results: Here we show that Gamma introduction in Sao Jose do Rio Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil, was followed by the displacement of seven circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants and a rapid increase in prevalence two months after its first detection in January 2021. Moreover, Gamma variant is associated with increased mortality risk and severity of COVID-19 cases in younger age groups, which corresponds to the unvaccinated population at the time.
   Conclusions: Our findings highlight the beneficial effects of vaccination indicated by a pronounced reduction of severe cases and deaths in immunized individuals, reinforcing the need for rapid and massive vaccination.

TI  - <i>Calonectria</i> (<i>Cylindrocladium</i>) species associated with dying <i>Pinus</i> cuttings
T2  - PERSOONIA
AB  - Calonectria (Ca.) species and their Cylindrocladium (Cy.) anamorphs are well-known pathogens of forest nursery plants in subtropical and tropical areas of the world. An investigation of the mortality of rooted Pinus cuttings in a commercial forest nursery in Colombia led to the isolation of two Cylindrocladium anamorphs of Calonectria species. The aim of this study was to identify these species using DNA sequence data and morphological comparisons. Two species were identified, namely one undescribed species, and Cy. gracile, which is allocated to Calonectria as Ca. brassicae. The new species, Ca. brachiatica, resides in the Ca. brassicae species complex. Pathogenicity tests with Ca. brachiatica and Ca. bressicae showed that both are able to cause disease on Pinus maximinoi and P tecunumanii. An emended key is provided to distinguish between Calonectria species with clavate vesicles and 1-septate macroconidia.

TI  - Monitoring and Control of <i>Aedes albopictus</i>, a Vector of Zika Virus, Near Residences of Imported Zika Virus Patients during 2016 in South Korea
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is an arthropod-borne virus mainly transmitted by Aedes species. A total of nine of the 16 imported ZIKV reported cases during the mosquito season in the Republic of Korea (ROK), following the return of local nationals from foreign ZIKV endemic countries, were surveyed for Aedes albopictus. Surveillance and vector control of Ae. albopictus, a potential vector of ZIKV, and related species are critical for reducing the potential for autochthonous transmission in the ROK. Surveillance and vector control were coordinated by Korean Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (KCDC) and conducted by local health authorities within 200 m of imported ZIKV patients' residences. After diagnosis, thermal fogging (3 x week x 3 weeks), residual spray for homes and nearby structures (1 x week x 3 weeks), and larval control (3 x week x 3 weeks) were conducted in accordance with national guidelines developed by KCDC in early 2016. Of the nine residences surveyed using BG Sentinel traps, Ae. albopictus trap indices (TIs) for the three (3) patients' residences located near/in forested areas were significantly higher than the six patients' residences located inside villages/urban areas or low-lying farmland without trees. Overall, Ae. albopictus TIs in forested areas decreased by 90.4% after adult and larval control, whereas TIs decreased by 75.8% for residences in nonforested areas. A total of 3,216 Aedes and Ochlerotatus spp. were assayed by real-time polymerase chain reaction for ZIKV, dengue, and chikungunya virus. Both species collected before and after vector control were negative for all viruses. Vector control within 200 m of residences of imported ZIKV patients, conducted in accordance with established guidelines, may have effectively reduced human-mosquito-human transmission cycle by competent vectors in South Korea.

TI  - Bioecological Drivers of Rabies Virus Circulation in a Neotropical Bat Community
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Introduction
   In addition to the commonly accepted importance of the vampire bat in the maintenance and transmission of the rabies virus (RABV) in South America, RABV infection of other species is widely evidenced, challenging their role in the viral cycle.
   Methodology/Principles findings
   To identify the bioecological drivers of RABV circulation in neotropical bat communities, we conducted a molecular and serological survey on almost 1,000 bats from 30 species, and a 4-year longitudinal survey in two colonies of vampire bats in French Guiana. RABV was molecularly detected in a common vampire and in a frugivorous bat. The sequences corresponded to haematophagous bat-related strains and were close to viruses circulating in the Brazilian Amazon region. Species' seroprevalence ranged from 0 to 20%, and the risk of seropositivity was higher in bats with a haematophagous diet, living in monospecific colonies and in dense forests. The longitudinal survey showed substantial temporal fluctuations, with individual waves of seroconversions and waning immunity. The high prevalences observed in bat communities, in most habitats and in species that do not share the same microhabitats and bioecological patterns, the temporal variations, and a rather short period of detectable antibodies as observed in recaptured vampires suggest (i) frequent exposure of animals, (ii) an ability of the infected host to control and eliminate the virus, (iii) more relaxed modes of exposure between bats than the commonly assumed infection via direct contact with saliva of infected animals, all of which should be further investigated.
   Conclusions/significance
   We hypothesize that RABV circulation in French Guiana is mainly maintained in the pristine forest habitats that may provide sufficient food resources to allow vampire bats, the main prevalent species, to survive and RABV to be propagated. However, on the forest edge andin disturbed areas, human activities may induce more insidious effects such as defaunation. One of the ecological consequences is the disappearance of resources for tertiary or secondary consumers. Populations of vampires may then shift to alternative resources such as cattle, domestic animals and humans. Therefore, a good forest status, allowing both a dilution effect in highly rich bat communities and the maintenance of large populations of medium-sized and large mammals used as prey by vampires, should prevent their migration to anthropized areas.

TI  - An assessment of the niche centroid hypothesis: <i>Pteropus lylei</i> (Chiroptera)
T2  - ECOSPHERE
AB  - Recent ecological theories propose that species reach their highest abundance and genetic diversity in the center of their ecological niche and decline toward the edges. We assessed whether Lyle's flying fox, Pteropus lylei, abundance and genetic diversity were correlated with niche centroid distance using an ecological niche model as a proxy for fundamental niche (N-F). Alternatively, we assessed whether P. lylei abundance and genetic diversity were correlated with fine-scale environmental factors as a proxy of the species' realized niche (N-R). We examined relationships between abundance and environmental factors at coarse and fine scales as proxies of N-F and N-R, respectively. For coarse scale, ecological niche of P. lylei was modeled using all available occurrence records in Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam, coupled with climatic data. We conducted field measurements of P. lylei abundance and used genetic structure data across a large portion of the species' range. We measured Euclidean distances between abundance and genetic data and the niche centroid in environmental dimensions. Spearman's correlation was estimated between abundance and genetic diversity vs. distance to the niche centroid. Complementarily, for the fine-scale test, we measured multiple regression models between abundance and genetic diversity versus the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), local temperature, percent area of waterbodies, human density, and number of Buddhist temples. We failed to detect relationships between abundance and genetic diversity with the distance to the niche centroid in the coarse-scale model. When using the fine-scale, landscape-level data, we found negative correlation between genetic diversity and number of temples. The data available were unable to support niche centroid hypothesis for the current distribution and abundances of P. lylei. We note that our failure to find an association does not support nor reject the niche centroid hypothesis. Instead, our capacity to test the niche centroid hypothesis may be limited by our ability to use empirical data to accurately reconstruct N-F from field observations only. Future research may require physiology-based experimental approaches to explore relationships between species abundances and the niche structure.

TI  - Field efficacy of a new repellent, KBR 3023, against Aedes albopictus (SKUSE) and Culex quinquefasciatus (SAY) in a tropical environment
T2  - JOURNAL OF VECTOR ECOLOGY
CP  - 2nd International Congress of Vector Ecology
AB  - Two new repellent formulations, KBR 3023 10% and 20% from Bayer AG, Germany, were evaluated together with DEET 10% and 20% as standard repellent formulations. Evaluation was based on two separate field studies: a daytime study (0900-1700 hr) in a forested orchard on Penang Island and a nighttime study (2100-0100 hr) in a squatter residential area on the adjacent mainland of peninsular Malaysia. Both studies were carried out by exposing humans with bars arms and legs to mosquitoes landing/biting for an eight hour period. Right arms and legs of the human baits were treated with different repellent formulations (KBR 3023 10%, 20% and DEET 10%, 20%) and the left limbs were left untreated to act as controls. The daytime study indicated that all four formulations were equally effective (P < 0.05) as repellents against the predominant Aedes albopictus with greater than 88.5% reduction in landing/biting in the first four hours and not less than 65.0% in the next four hours of the assessment period. In the night study, all four formulations were also found to be equally effective (P < 0.05) in repelling Culex quinquefasciatus, the predominant species. All four formulations provided complete protection against Cx. quinquefasciatus in the first two hours of exposure. The percentage reduction values were maintained above 90.0% for the next six hours of the assessment period. In conclusion, both the KBR 3023 and DEET formulations were found to be equally effective (P < 0.05) in providing along-lasting reduction in human-mosquito contact in both the day and night field studies.

TI  - Gastrointestinal Bacterial Transmission among Humans, Mountain Gorillas, and Livestock in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
AB  - Habitat overlap can increase the risks of anthroponotic and zoonotic pathogen transmission between humans, livestock, and wild apes. We collected Escherichia coli bacteria from humans, livestock, and mountain gorillas (Gorilla gorilla beringei) in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda, from May to August 2005 to examine whether habitat overlap influences rates and patterns of pathogen transmission between humans and apes and whether livestock might facilitate transmission. We genotyped 496 E. coli isolates with repetitive extragenic palindromic polymerase chain reaction fingerprinting and measured susceptibility to 11 antibiotics with the disc-diffusion method. We conducted population genetic analyses to examine genetic differences among populations of bacteria from different hosts and locations. Gorilla populations that overlapped in their use of habitat at high rates with people and livestock harbored E. coli that were genetically similar to E. coli from those people and livestock, whereas E. coli from gorillas that did not overlap in their use of habitats with people and livestock were more distantly related to human or livestock bacteria. Thirty-five percent of isolates from humans, 27% of isolates from livestock, and 17% of isolates from gorillas were clinically resistant to at least one antibiotic used by local people, and the proportion of individual gorillas harboring resistant isolates declined across populations in proportion to decreasing degrees of habitat overlap with humans. These patterns of genetic similarity and antibiotic resistance among E. coli from populations of apes, humans, and livestock indicate that habitat overlap between species affects the dynamics of gastrointestinal bacterial transmission, perhaps through domestic animal intermediates and the physical environment. Limiting such transmission would benefit human and domestic animal health and ape conservation.

TI  - Electronic structure and gas-phase chemistry of protonated α- and β-quinonoid compounds: a mass spectrometry and computational study
T2  - RAPID COMMUNICATIONS IN MASS SPECTROMETRY
AB  - RATIONALE The use of quinonoid compounds against tropical diseases and as antitumor agents has prompted the search for new naturally occurring and synthetic derivatives. Among these quinonoid compounds, lapachol and its isomers (- and -lapachone) serve as models for the synthesis of new compounds with biological activity, and the use of electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) analysis as a tool to elucidate and characterize these products has furnished important information about these compounds. METHODS ESI-MS/MS analysis under collision-induced dissociation conditions was used to describe the fragmentation mechanisms for protonated 1,4-naphthoquinone, 1,2-naphthoquinone, -lapachone, and -lapachone. The B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) model was used to obtain proton affinities, gas-phase basicities, and molecular electrostatic potential maps, thus indicating the probable protonation sites. Fragmentation pathways were suggested on the basis of the relative enthalpies of the product ions. RESULTS The ESI-MS signals of the cationized molecules of ortho quinonoid compounds were more intense than those of the protonated molecule. Formation of the major product ions with m/z 187 from protonated - and -lapachone has been attributed to a retro-Diels-Alder (RDA) reaction. CONCLUSIONS MS/MS studies on lapachol isomers (- and -lapachone) will facilitate the interpretation of the liquid chromatography (LC)-MS/MS analysis of new metabolites. MS/MS data on the 1,4-naphthoquinone, 1,2-naphthoquinone, -lapachone and -lapachone core will help characterize new derivatives from in vitro/in vivo metabolism studies in complex matrices. The product ions revealed the major fragmentation mechanisms and these ions will serve as diagnostic ions to identify each studied compound. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Community-Based Sampling Methods for Surveillance of the Chagas Disease Vector, <i>Triatoma dimidiata</i> (Hemiptera: Reduviidae: Triatominae)
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - In Guatemala, the most widespread vector of Trypanosoma cruzi (Kinetoplastida: Trypanosomatidae), the causative agent of Chagas disease, is Triatoma dimidiata (Latreille) (Hemiptera: Reduviidae: Triatominae). T. dimidiata is native to Guatemala and is present in both domestic and sylvatic habitats. Consequently, control of T. dimidiata is difficult because after successful elimination from homes, individual insects can recolonize homes from the surrounding environment. Therefore, intensive long-term surveillance of this species is essential to ensure adequate control is achieved. Manual inspection for signs of infestation, the current method used to monitor Triatominae throughout Central and South America, is labor and time-consuming, so cost-effective alternatives are needed. The current study compared the effectiveness of the current method of surveillance of T. dimidiata with community-based techniques of Gomez-Nunez sensor boxes, collection and observation of bugs by householders, and presence of triatomine-like feces on walls. Although manual inspection was the most sensitive method when used alone, collection by householders also was sensitive and specific and involved less effort. Sensor boxes were not sensitive indicators of T. dimidiata infestation when used alone. Two recorded variables, visual inspection for feces and the sighting of bugs by householders, were sensitive and specific indicators of infestation, and in combination with collection by householders and sensor boxes these methods were significantly more likely to detect infestations than manual inspection alone. A surveillance program that combines multiple community-based techniques should have low cost and involve minimal effort from the government and at the same time promote sustainable community involvement in disease prevention.

TI  - Does India perform medical research in areas where it is most needed?
T2  - NATIONAL MEDICAL JOURNAL OF INDIA
CP  - 5th Conference of the International-Society-for-Scientometrics-and-Informetrics
AB  - This paper attempts to map medical research in India and answer an important policy question by literature analysis. I match the disease pattern on the basis of mortality and morbidity statistics with journals used by Indian medical researchers to publish their work as shown by the Science Citation Index (SCI). The former reflects the needs while the latter reflects the areas in which research is being done. The limited statistics available from both the Government of India and the World Health Organization point to diarrhoeal dic;eases, diseases of children, respiratory diseases, circulatory system diseases, infectious diseases, malaria and tuberculosis as the major medical problems faced by India. The journals used often by Indian medical researchers to publish their work, as seen from the SCI (1981-85), show that in terms of number of publications, they are mainly active in general medicine, pharmacology, tropical medicine, neurosciences, radiology, oncology and pathology. In terms of the share of the world's literature in different subfields, India is second only to USA in andrology, third in tropical medicine after the USA and the UK, tenth in hygiene and public health, and eleventh in general and internal medicine, and radiology and nuclear medicine. Overall, India's share in the medical journal literature is not only much less than that of many other countries, both advanced and middle level, but also much less than that of India's share of the literature in physics, chemistry, mathematics and engineering. Data on the observed citation impact of Indian research in different subfields of medicine show that the work done in India in general is not integrated well into international research. India could be much more purposive in her research priorities and probably should invest much more in medical research.

TI  - Comparison of Malaria Simulations Driven by Meteorological Observations and Reanalysis Products in Senegal
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - The analysis of the spatial and temporal variability of climate parameters is crucial to study the impact of climate-sensitive vector-borne diseases such as malaria. The use of malaria models is an alternative way of producing potential malaria historical data for Senegal due to the lack of reliable observations for malaria outbreaks over a long time period. Consequently, here we use the Liverpool Malaria Model (LMM), driven by different climatic datasets, in order to study and validate simulated malaria parameters over Senegal. The findings confirm that the risk of malaria transmission is mainly linked to climate variables such as rainfall and temperature as well as specific landscape characteristics. For the whole of Senegal, a lag of two months is generally observed between the peak of rainfall in August and the maximum number of reported malaria cases in October. The malaria transmission season usually takes place from September to November, corresponding to the second peak of temperature occurring in October. Observed malaria data from the Programme National de Lutte contre le Paludisme (PNLP, National Malaria control Programme in Senegal) and outputs from the meteorological data used in this study were compared. The malaria model outputs present some consistencies with observed malaria dynamics over Senegal, and further allow the exploration of simulations performed with reanalysis data sets over a longer time period. The simulated malaria risk significantly decreased during the 1970s and 1980s over Senegal. This result is consistent with the observed decrease of malaria vectors and malaria cases reported by field entomologists and clinicians in the literature. The main differences between model outputs and observations regard amplitude, but can be related not only to reanalysis deficiencies but also to other environmental and socio-economic factors that are not included in this mechanistic malaria model framework. The present study can be considered as a validation of the reliability of reanalysis to be used as inputs for the calculation of malaria parameters in the Sahel using dynamical malaria models.

TI  - Accumulated Impacts of Sulfur Spraying on Soil Nutrient Availability and Microbial Biomass in Rubber Plantations
T2  - CLEAN-SOIL AIR WATER
AB  - Sulfur spraying is a conventional prevention and control measure for rubber leaf diseases in the northern margin of tropical Southeast Asia. The aim of this study was to determine the long-term (48 years) accumulated effects of sulfur spraying on some major soil microbial and nutrient properties in the area of rubber plantation. The results indicate a significant decrease in pH along the rubber chronosequence with yearly sulfur application. A negative effect of sulfur spraying on soil total sulfur content was also observed. Apart from that, soil microbial characteristics increased significantly, except for microbial biomass carbon. Soil nutrient bioavailability-related characteristics showed a complex pattern of response to sulfur spraying, among which bio-available ammonium nitrogen increased linearly, bio-available nitrate nitrogen showed a trend resembling a large resting capital letter "S", bio-available phosphorus showed a contrary trend to nitrogen, a capital letter "S" resting the other direction, whereas bio-available potassium had no response to sulfur spraying. Based on the comprehensive response indexes, soil microbial characteristics had a pulsing response to sulfur spraying accumulation and two critical turning points were sometime between the 23rd and 32nd year and between the 40th and 48th year. Soil nutrient bioavailability showed a volatile comprehensive pattern, but there was no significant difference during the chronosequence. There is need for control sulfur deposition frequency and dosage under the soil and environmental safety threshold in the diseases prevention and control in monoculture rubber plantation.

TI  - Interaction between ants and fruits of <i>Guapira opposita</i> (Nyctaginaceae) in a Brazilian sandy plain rainforest:: ant effects on seeds and seedlings
T2  - OECOLOGIA
AB  - This study examines the dispersal system of Guapira opposita in a tropical sandy rainforest in southeast Brazil. Guapira trees produce small fruits with a high protein content (28.4%) and low lipid content (0.3%), and the plant is primarily dispersed by birds. Mature fruits of G. opposita can fall spontaneously with the pulp intact, or be dropped by birds with bits of pulp attached. In either case, ground-dwelling ants rapidly remove the fruits to their nest (93% after 12 h). The ponerine ants Odontomachus chelifer and Pachycondyla striata are the main seed vectors among the ants, and together account for 56% (20 of 36) of the ant-fruit interactions recorded on the forest floor. Individual workers of O. chelifer and P. striata transport single fruits to their nests. Bits of pulp are fed to larvae and worker nestmates, and intact seeds are discarded outside the nest. Germination success in Guapira is higher for cleaned seeds (pulp removed) than for seeds coated by pulp. Guapira seedlings and juveniles are more frequent close to Odontomachus nests than at sites without such nests. Soil samples from Odontomachus nests had greater penetrability, and higher concentrations of P, K, and Ca than random soil samples. Field experiments suggest that the association between G. opposita seedlings and O. chelifer nests can potentially render the plant some protection against herbivores. Results indicate that fruit displacement by ponerine ants play an important role in the biology of G. opposita seeds and seedlings in the sandy forest, and illustrate the complex nature of the dispersal ecology of tropical tree species.

TI  - Delineating fragmented grassland patches in the tropical region using multi-seasonal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical satellite images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Globally, grasslands are declining and are in highly degraded conditions. In South Asia, grasslands are neglected and treated as wastelands. They remain unprotected, highly fragmented, and poorly understood, which has led to a loss of unique biodiversity and livelihoods. Mapping grasslands accurately is a challenge and current maps based on optical remote sensing often over- or underestimate grasslands in South Asia due to the prevalent complex landscape matrix, small patch sizes, and obscuring monsoonal clouds. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), fused with moderate spatial resolution optical data, has been used to delineate grasslands, but the high-resolution, freely available European Space Agency (ESA)'s Sentinel-1 (SAR) and Sentinel-2 (Optical) provide an opportunity to map small and fragmented patches. Further, high-resolution imageries require high computing power, which is often limited to stand-alone machines. Here, we demonstrate that using cloud computing and optimal use of multi-seasonal imagery, one can obtain a highly accurate land-cover land use (LCLU) classification for a complex habitat matrix. We performed LCLU classification using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm of Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 (Combined) in Google Earth Engine (GEE). GEE is a freely accessible cloud computing platform. We compared the accuracy of grassland classes between a) Sentinel-1 seasonal (pre-, during, and post-monsoon), b) Sentinel-2 post-monsoon, and c) combined Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2. We tested this method at two sites in a highly fragmented habitat matrix in arid and semi-arid areas of Western and Southern India. The classification results have shown that the overall accuracy for the combined image classification was higher than only Sentinel-2 or Sentinel-1 alone for both sites. Grassland class accuracy was also consistent with combined image classification across the sites. Our results identified newer grassland areas that coarse land use management maps used by the government did not. Since the computation was conducted in GEE, a regular laptop was sufficient for the user and processing was completed rapidly. We, therefore, suggest that this approach of using cloud computing and optimal use of resource-hungry (computation and storage) high-resolution Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data can be used to identify major LCLU classes and patchy grasslands in the arid and semi-arid regions of India and has the potential to map at a continent level.

TI  - Landscape Composition and Spatial Prediction of Alveolar Echinococcosis in Southern Ningxia, China
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background: Alveolar echinococcosis (AE) presents a serious public health challenge within China. Mass screening ultrasound surveys can detect pre-symptomatic AE, but targeting areas identified from hospital records is inefficient regarding AE. Prediction of undetected or emerging hotspots would increase detection rates. Voles and lemmings of the subfamily Arvicolinae are important intermediate hosts in sylvatic transmission systems. Their populations reach high densities in productive grasslands where food and cover are abundant. Habitat availability is thought to affect arvicoline population dynamic patterns and definitive host-intermediate host interactions. Arvicoline habitat correlates with AE prevalence in Western Europe and southern Gansu Province, China.
   Methods and Findings: Xiji County, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, borders southern Gansu. The aims of this study were to map AE prevalence across Xiji and test arvicoline habitat as a predictor. Land cover was mapped using remotely sensed (Landsat) imagery. Infection status of 3,205 individuals screened in 2002-2003 was related, using generalised additive mixed models, to covariates: gender; farming; ethnicity; dog ownership; water source; and areal cover of mountain pasture and lowland pasture. A Markov random field modelled additional spatial variation and uncertainty. Mountain pasture and lowland pasture were associated with below and above average AE prevalence, respectively.
   Conclusions: Low values of the normalised difference vegetation index indicated sub-optimality of lowland pasture for grassland arvicolines. Unlike other known endemic areas, grassland arvicolines probably did not provide the principal reservoir for Echinococcus multilocularis in Xiji. This result is consistent with recent small mammal surveys reporting low arvicoline densities and high densities of hamsters, pikas and jerboas, all suitable intermediate hosts for E. multilocularis, in reforested lowland pasture. The risk of re-emergence is discussed. We recommend extending monitoring to: southern Haiyuan County, where predicted prevalence was high; southern Xiji County, where prediction uncertainty was high; and monitoring small mammal community dynamics and the infection status of dogs.

TI  - VECTORIAL CAPACITY AND ENTOMOLOGICAL INOCULATION RATES OF ANOPHELES-GAMBIAE IN A HIGH RAINFALL FORESTED AREA OF SOUTHERN SIERRA-LEONE
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND PARASITOLOGY
AB  - We report the first study of gonotrophic cycle duration, survival rates, pre-gravid rates, vectorial capacity and chromosomal polymorphism of Anopheles gambiae s.s. in Sierra Leone. In the village of Bayama in the Southern Province, An. gambiae was the only species found to be naturally infected with Plasmodium falciparum and it constituted 99.7% of 22,541 anopheline mosquitoes caught. Chromosomal studies revealed only An. gambiae s.s. out of 66 females examined for chromosomal polymorphism, 61 (92.4%) had the 2LA inversion in the standard arrangement. Other inversions observed in low frequencies included 2Rcu and 2Ru. We estimated a gonotrophic cycle length of three days and survival rate per gonotrophic cycle of 0.59 for this species. The mean daily survival rate of An. gambiae was 0.85 and the entomological inoculation rate was 1,235 infective bites/person/year. Blood-meal ELISA tests showed that the species was very anthropophagic and that there were an estimated 35.4 daily inoculations per infective case. The epidemiological significance of these entomological parameters is discussed in the light of parasitological results for nearby villages.

TI  - A Neutralizing Monoclonal Antibody Targeting the Acid-Sensitive Region in Chikungunya Virus E2 Protects from Disease
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - The mosquito-borne alphavirus, chikungunya virus (CHIKV), has recently reemerged, producing the largest epidemic ever recorded for this virus, with up to 6.5 million cases of acute and chronic rheumatic disease. There are currently no licensed vaccines for CHIKV and current anti-inflammatory drug treatment is often inadequate. Here we describe the isolation and characterization of two human monoclonal antibodies, C9 and E8, from CHIKV infected and recovered individuals. C9 was determined to be a potent virus neutralizing antibody and a biosensor antibody binding study demonstrated it recognized residues on intact CHIKV VLPs. Shotgun mutagenesis alanine scanning of 98 percent of the residues in the E1 and E2 glycoproteins of CHIKV envelope showed that the epitope bound by C9 included amino-acid 162 in the acid-sensitive region (ASR) of the CHIKV E2 glycoprotein. The ASR is critical for the rearrangement of CHIKV E2 during fusion and viral entry into host cells, and we predict that C9 prevents these events from occurring. When used prophylactically in a CHIKV mouse model, C9 completely protected against CHIKV viremia and arthritis. We also observed that when administered therapeutically at 8 or 18 hours post-CHIKV challenge, C9 gave 100% protection in a pathogenic mouse model. Given that targeting this novel neutralizing epitope in E2 can potently protect both in vitro and in vivo, it is likely to be an important region both for future antibody and vaccine-based interventions against CHIKV.

TI  - Entomological Surveillance of <i>Aedes</i> Mosquitoes: Comparison of Different Collection Methods in an Endemic Area in RIO de Janeiro, Brazil
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE
AB  - Using collection methods for Aedes adults as surveillance tools provides reliable indices and arbovirus detection possibilities. This study compared the effectiveness of different methods for collecting Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus and detecting arboviruses circulating in field-caught female specimens. Collection sites were defined in urban, peri-urban, and rural landscapes in two Brazilian cities. Collections were performed using Adultraps (ADT), BG-Sentinel (BGS), CDC-like traps (CDC), and indoor (ASP-I) and outdoor (ASP-O) aspiration during the rainy and dry seasons of 2015 and 2016. Generalized linear mixed models were used to model the effectiveness of each collection method. A total of 434 Ae. aegypti and 393 Ae. albopictus were collected. In total, 64 Ae. aegypti and sixteen Ae. albopictus female pools were tested for DENV, CHIKV, ZIKV, or YFV; none were positive. Positivity and density were linear at low densities (<1 specimen); thereafter, the relationship became non-linear. For Ae. aegypti, ADT and CDC were less effective, and ASP-I and ASP-O were as effective as BGS. For Ae. albopictus, all collection methods were less effective than BGS. This study highlights the need for an integrated surveillance method as an effective tool for monitoring Aedes vectors.

TI  - Remote Sensing and Modeling of Mosquito Abundance and Habitats in Coastal Virginia, USA
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - The increase in mosquito populations following extreme weather events poses a major threat to humans because of mosquitoes' ability to carry disease-causing pathogens, particularly in low-lying, poorly drained coastal plains vulnerable to tropical cyclones. In areas with reservoirs of disease, mosquito abundance information can help to identify the areas at higher risk of disease transmission. Using a Geographic Information System (GIS), mosquito abundance is predicted across the City of Chesapeake, Virginia. The mosquito abundance model uses mosquito light trap counts, a habitat suitability model, and dynamic environmental variables (temperature and precipitation) to predict the abundance of the species Culiseta melanura, as well as the combined abundance of the ephemeral species, Aedes vexans and Psorophora columbiae, for the year 2003. Remote sensing techniques were used to quantify environmental variables for a potential habitat suitability index for the mosquito species. The goal of this study was to produce an abundance model that could guide risk assessment, surveillance, and potential disease transmission. Results highlight the utility of integrating field surveillance, remote sensing for synoptic landscape habitat distributions, and dynamic environmental data for predicting mosquito vector abundance across low-lying coastal plains. Limitations of mosquito trapping and multi-source geospatial environmental data are highlighted for future spatial modeling of disease transmission risk.

T2  - TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE
AB  - The global health system has significantly evolved over the last 30 years, particularly since the UN Millennium Declaration in 2000. The transformation in global healthcare partnerships has been most visible in the area of neglected tropical diseases, where technological innovation is directly linked to social change. Numerous strategic partnerships between different actors, including pharmaceutical companies, global and national health institutions and philanthropic organizations and disease specific foundations populate the landscape of neglected tropical diseases and yet, we know little on relational and structural aspects underpinning the partnerships. Our research uses a rich longitudinal case study - a tripartite public-private partnership formed between a global health organization, a major pharmaceutical company and a research university to develop a new drug for the treatment of malaria in Sub-Saharan Africa. Development of new drugs is central to attain social change in a poverty stricken region. We adopt a micro-foundational perspective in analyzing strategic choices made by the partnership's Product Development Team (PDT) and unravel the dynamic interplay between power-trust relationship in such strategic business partnerships.

TI  - Population genetic structure and phenotypic diversity of <i>Aspidodera raillieti</i> (Nematoda: Heterakoidea), a parasite of Didelphini marsupials in Brazil's South and Southeast Atlantic Forest
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
AB  - Background: The population genetics of parasites may be influenced by host specificity, life cycle, host geographical range, evolutionary history, and host population structure. The nematode Aspidodera raillieti infects different marsupial and rodent hosts in the Nearctic and Neotropical regions, implying a gene flow among populations. However, niche diversification of the main hosts of A. raillieti in superimposed areas may provide conditions for population genetic structuring within this parasite species. We examined the genetic structuring of A. raillieti infecting three marsupial species co-occurring along the South and Southeast Brazilian Atlantic Forest, a hotspot of biodiversity.
   Methods: We employed morphometric analyses and partial mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I gene sequences (MT-CO1) to characterize populations via phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses.
   Results: Among 175 A. raillieti specimens recovered from the marsupial hosts Didelphis aurita, D. albiventris, and Philander quica, we identified 99 MT-001 haplotypes forming four haplogroups and four clades in networks and phylogenetic trees, respectively. Clades I and II encompassed parasites of D. albiventris from the South region, Glade III comprised parasites of D. aurita from the South and Southeast regions, and Glade IV encompassed parasites of D. aurita and D. albiventris from the South and Southeast regions and parasites of P. quica from the South region. High genetic differentiation between clades, with a high fixation index and greater genetic variation in the analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA), indicated low gene flow between clades. Haplotypes shared among host species revealed a lack of host specificity. A significant correlation in the Mantel test suggested parasite isolation by distance, while there was no evidence of geographical structure between populations. Negative neutrality test values for clades III and IV suggested recent population expansion. Morphometric differentiation between A. raillieti specimens recovered from different host species, as well as from different localities, was more evident in males.
   Conclusion: The genetic structure of A. raillieti populations in the South and Southeast Atlantic Forest resulted from historical events rather than from current geographical distribution or host specificity. We also demonstrate morphometric variation associated with host species and localities, suggesting phenotypic plasticity to host attributes and to spatial variables.

T2  - TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Baseline studies to evaluate the role of different anopheline mosquitoes as probable vectors of malaria in the Lacandon rainforest region in Chiapas (Mexico) were carried out in 3 rural villages between June and November 1988.  Anopheles vestitipennis was the most abundant species in all the villages, followed by An. albimanus, An. punctimacula and An. darlingi. Human bait collections showed that An. vestitipennis and An. albimanus tended to bite man either indoors or outdoors, while An. punctimacula preferred to bite outdoors.  Monthly man-biting rates of An. vestitipennis tended to follow the rainfall pattern.  Plasmodium vivax was detected in An. vestitipennis only, with an estimated overall infection rate of 4.67 per 1000 mosquitoes (range 0-54.42, of 3500 mosquitoes assayed).  This is the first incrimination of An. vestitipennis as a probable vector of P. vivax in Mexico.

TI  - Sand flies naturally infected by <i>Leishmania</i> (<i>L</i>.) <i>mexicana</i> in the peri-urban area of Chetumal city, Quintana Roo, Mexico
T2  - TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - The surveillance of prevalent Leishmania sand fly vectors is an important issue for epidemiological studies in populated areas where leishmaniasis is endemic. In this study, we collected sand flies from a pen-urban area in the southeast of Mexico. Natural infection with Leishmania (L.) mexicana was studied by PCR using a Leishmania internal transcribed spacer of the ribosomal RNA gene for amplification. Infected Lutzomyia olmeca olmeca, Lu. shannoni and Lu. cruciata sand flies were collected mainly during the high transmission season (November to March), coinciding with the highest sand fly densities. Additionally, positive specimens of Lu. olmeca olmeca were also captured during July and August. The infected sand flies were from primary forest (subperennial forest) and secondary forest (18-25 years old and 10-15 years old respectively). Sand flies collected with Disney and Shannon traps were the ones found to be infected with L. (L.) mexicana. We conclude that the high-risk period in which L. (L.) mexicana is transmitted in the pen-urban area of Chetumal City is from July to March and that transmission is associated with both the subperennial forest and the secondary forest.

They are 5 men which have lived between 3 weeks and 4 years in forested areas of Cameroon in four cases and C (o) over cap te d'Ivoire in one case. The incubation period varied from 5 months to 2 years. The limb oedema was always located to one arm. It was associated with a blood eosinophilia above 2000/mm(3) in 4 of 5 patients. The skin detection of microfilaria of Onchocerca volvulus was positive in every case. The serodiagnostic tests were negative for indirect immunoflurescent assay and immunoelectrophoresis with exception of one patient. These patients were cured with ivermectine and/or diethylcarbamazine. In addition, 26 other cases described in the litterature are discussed.

TI  - The use of hand-raised psittacines for reintroduction:: a case study of scarlet macaws (<i>Ara macao</i>) in Peru and Costa Rica
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - This study reports on three scarlet macaw (Ara macao) reintroduction projects using hand-raised birds in Peru and Costa Rica. The habitats at the release sites ranged from pristine tropical forest to forest fragments in an agricultural matrix. The combined first-year survival was 74% and the annual post first-year survival was 96%. Survival rates were very high despite a wide range in predator communities. Number of birds released explained 70% of the variation in survival with birds from larger releases having higher survival rates. Behavioral evidence suggests that birds established at the site facilitated survival of later releases. Breeding attempts were recorded at all three sites and hand-raised birds with wild mates successfully fledged young in Peru. Supplemental feeding post-release played an important role in keeping the birds near the release site and facilitating social interactions. This work shows that properly socialized hand-raised macaws can survive and breed in the wild but that ex-pets are not good release candidates. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Growth stresses and strains in <i>Acacia mangium</i>
T2  - FOREST PRODUCTS JOURNAL
AB  - The growth stresses and other properties of timber from plantation trees of Acacia mangium affected by the high growth rate were investigated in order to clarify the relationship between growth stresses and growth rate on tropical fast-growing species. Twenty-four stands with various ages (4 to 10 yr) and diameters (8.8 to 30.5 cm) from one section of Perum Perhutani manmade forest area in West Java, Indonesia were selected. The growth stresses of A. mangium were higher compared to those from species of temperate zones. From the radial vectors 4 to 15 cm the longitudinal released strains were almost constant with average values ranging from -0.04 to -0.10 percent. Higher negative values were located in the tension wood regions. The growth rate did not affect either the magnitude or the radial distribution of growth stresses inside the stem (residual stresses). There was no significant relationship between growth rate and specific gravity. However, a clear correlation was found between the released strains and the microfibril angle (MFA). The smaller the MFA (below 8 degrees), the higher the absolute values of the released strains. In order to obtain stands of A, mangium with lower growth stress levels, it is important to avoid the formation of tension wood.

TI  - Population history, phylogeography, and conservation genetics of the last Neotropical mega-herbivore, the lowland tapir (<i>Tapirus terrestris</i>)
T2  - BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY
AB  - Background: Understanding the forces that shaped Neotropical diversity is central issue to explain tropical biodiversity and inform conservation action; yet few studies have examined large, widespread species. Lowland tapir (Tapirus terrrestris, Perissodactyla, Tapiridae) is the largest Neotropical herbivore whose ancestors arrived in South America during the Great American Biotic Interchange. A Pleistocene diversification is inferred for the genus Tapirus from the fossil record, but only two species survived the Pleistocene megafauna extinction. Here, we investigate the history of lowland tapir as revealed by variation at the mitochondrial gene Cytochrome b, compare it to the fossil data, and explore mechanisms that could have shaped the observed structure of current populations.
   Results: Separate methodological approaches found mutually exclusive divergence times for lowland tapir, either in the late or in the early Pleistocene, although a late Pleistocene divergence is more in tune with the fossil record. Bayesian analysis favored mountain tapir (T. pinchaque) paraphyly in relation to lowland tapir over reciprocal monophyly, corroborating the inferences from the fossil data these species are sister taxa. A coalescent-based analysis rejected a null hypothesis of allopatric divergence, suggesting a complex history. Based on the geographic distribution of haplotypes we propose (i) a central role for western Amazonia in tapir diversification, with a key role of the ecological gradient along the transition between Andean subcloud forests and Amazon lowland forest, and (ii) that the Amazon river acted as an barrier to gene flow. Finally, the branching patterns and estimates based on nucleotide diversity indicate a population expansion after the Last Glacial Maximum.
   Conclusions: This study is the first examining lowland tapir phylogeography. Climatic events at the end of the Pleistocene, parapatric speciation, divergence along the Andean foothill, and role of the Amazon river, have similarly shaped the history of other taxa. Nevertheless further work with additional samples and loci is needed to improve our initial assessment. From a conservation perspective, we did not find a correspondence between genetic structure in lowland tapir and ecogeographic regions proposed to define conservation priorities in the Neotropics. This discrepancy sheds doubt into this scheme's ability to generate effective conservation planning for vagile species.

TI  - Soils from intercropped fields have a higher capacity to suppress black root rot in cassava, caused by <i>Scytalidium lignicola</i>
T2  - JOURNAL OF PHYTOPATHOLOGY
AB  - The objective of the present study was to evaluate the natural suppressive capacity of soils from forest, and monocropping and intercropping systems, against root rot, caused by Scytalidium lignicola, in a greenhouse experiment. We used soils from a tropical dry forest (FOR) and two intercropping and two monoculture systems. The first intercrop was maize and beans (CORNCOWP), and the second intercrop was cassava, pigeon peas and beans (CASPIGPCOWP). The first monoculture was beans, and the second was passion fruit. The intercropping soils showed a higher capacity to suppress black root rot in cassava than the monoculture because such soils were able to reduce disease severity by about 50%. Bean soil in the monoculture showed less microbial biomass carbon than in the intercrop, with means of 10.05 and 38.2 mg/kg, respectively. The higher density of bacteria and fungal populations, microbial biomass, urease and arylsulphatase activities correlated with a decrease in disease severity. Soils from the intercrops produced changes in soil quality, primarily in the population and density of microorganisms, enzymatic activities, total organic carbon and nutrients, reducing disease severity in cassava plants. These effects were validated by multivariate principal component analysis and showed three distinct groups: one FOR, one intercropping and one monocropping. The majority of vectors were in the direction of FOR and intercropping soils. We have provided some of the first data related to the beneficial effects of intercropping on the suppression of black root rot in cassava, which is validated through different attributes.

TI  - Diversity, distribution and abundance of Sandflies (Diptera: Psychodidae) in Parana State, Southern Brazil
T2  - NEOTROPICAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - Due to the spread of the Visceral leishmaniasis in Brazilian territory, this research was undertaken with the objective to identify the sandfly fauna and aspects of the species' behavior in forest and anthropic environments in Parana State, Brazil. ne sandfly captures were sporadically carried out in 37 municipalities of the Parana state, during the period from March 2004 to November 2005. Each municipality was once visited, when Falcao traps were installed during three consecutive nights in forested fragments and anthropic environments; captures with Shannon traps installed in forests and edge of forests, inspection of walls and electric aspiration in domiciles and forested areas were sporadically undertaken. The data analysis was based on estimates of frequency and abundance of the species, by five native landscapes. A total of 3 8,662 specimens belonging to 23 species were captured. Nyssomyia neivai (Pinto) (75.6%), Ny. whitmani (Antunes & Coutinho) (10.1%), Migonemyia migonei (Fran a) (7.8%), Expapillata firmatoi (Barreto et al.) (2.1%) and Pintomyia fischeri (Pinto) (1.6%) together constituted 97.2% of the phlebotomine colleteted. High frequencies of sand flies were found in forests, henhouses, pigpens and domiciles. The three most frequent species have been implicated in transmission of tegumentary leishmaniasis in Parana and in the Brazilian Southeastern and Southern Regions. Lutzomyia longipalpis (Lutz & Neiva), the visceral leishmaniasis vector was no found, however Lutzomyia gaminariai (Cordero et al.), female of which is similar to that of Lu. longaipalpis was captured, raising the need to investigate its behavior, including as regard to the vectorial competence.

TI  - The Current Distribution of <i>Oncomelania hupensis</i> Snails in the People's Republic of China Based on a Nationwide Survey
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE
AB  - Schistosomiasis is a helminth infection caused by the genus Schistosoma, which is still a threat in tropical and sub-tropical areas. In the China, schistosomiasis caused by Schistosoma japonicum is mainly endemic to the Yangtze River valley. The amphibious snail Oncomelania hupensis (O. hupensis) is the unique intermediate host of S. japonicum; hence, snail control is a crucial approach in the process of schistosomiasis transmission control and elimination. In 2016, a nationwide snail survey was conducted involving all snail habitats recorded since 1950 in all endemic counties of 12 provinces. A total of 53,254 existing snail habitats (ESHs) were identified, presenting three clusters in Sichuan Basin, Dongting Lake, and Poyang Lake. The overall habitat area was 5.24 billion m(2), of which 3.58 billion m(2) were inhabited by O. hupensis. The area inhabited by snails (AIS) in Dongting and Poyang Lakes accounted for 76.53% of the population in the country. Three typical landscape types (marshland and lakes, mountains and hills, and plain water networks) existed in endemic areas, and marshland and lakes had a predominant share (3.38 billion m(2)) of the AIS. Among the 12 endemic provinces, Hunan had a share of nearly 50% of AIS, whereas Guangdong had no ESH. Ditches, dryland, paddy fields, marshland, and ponds are common habitat types of the ESH. Although the AIS of the marshland type accounted for 87.22% of the population in the whole country, ditches were the most common type (35,025 or 65.77%) of habitat. Six categories of vegetation for ESHs were identified. A total of 39,139 habitats were covered with weeds, accounting for 55.26% of the coverage of the area. Multiple vegetation types of snail habitats appeared in the 11 provinces, but one or two of these were mainly dominant. Systematic sampling showed that the presence of living snails was 17.88% among the 13.5 million sampling frames. The occurrence varied significantly by landscape, environment, and vegetation type. The median density of living snails in habitats was 0.50 per frame (0.33 m x 0.33 m), and the highest density was 40.01 per frame. Furthermore, two main clusters with high snail densities and spatial correlations indicated by hotspot analysis were identified: one in Hunan and Hubei, the other in Sichuan. This national survey is the first full-scale census on the distribution of O. hupensis, which is significant, as transmission interruption and elimination are truly becoming the immediate goal of schistosomiasis control in China. The study discerns the detailed geographic distribution of O. hupensis with the hotspots of snail density in China. It is beneficial to understand the status of the snail population in order to finally formulate further national control planning.

TI  - Integrating genetic and silvicultural strategies to minimize abiotic and biotic constraints in Brazilian eucalypt plantations
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Organized forestry in Brazil began in the late 1960s, stimulated by a government policy which subsidized afforestation programs from 1967 to 1989 to develop an internationally-competitive wood-based industry, managed by the private sector. Currently, planted forests in Brazil total about 6.9 million ha, from which 4.9 million ha is planted with eucalypt (around 25% of world plantation), 1.6 million ha with pine, and 0.42 M ha with other species. Roundwood consumption of forest plantations totaled 170.1 million m(3) in 2011, eucalypt plantation accounted for 80.6% of this total.
   Most eucalypt plantations are managed in short rotations (6-8 years) and are established in regions with water, nutritional and frost stresses of low to high degrees. The mean annual increment is 40 m(3) ha(-1) year(-1) roundwood, ranging from 25 to 60 m(3) ha(-1) year(-1) depending on the level of environmental stress. Improving natural resources use efficiency by breeding and matching genotypes to sites and using appropriate site management practices is a key challenge to sustain or increase productivity.
   The wide range of eucalypt species and hybrids with different climatic and edaphic suitability associated with the easy propagation by seeds and cloning allow the adaptation of plantations to various tropical and subtropical regions in Brazil. The possibility of using eucalypt wood in a range of purposes has led large and small enterprises to establish eucalypt forests for multiple uses. The desirable characteristics in association with the accumulated knowledge on eucalypt silviculture encourage the use of this genus in most plantations. The most important factors in the selective process for a genotype are wood characteristics, productivity level, susceptibility to pests and diseases, drought tolerance, especially in tropical regions (frost free), and frost tolerance in subtropical regions (mostly without water deficit). In regions with pronounced seasonality and moderate to long drought periods, the planting of hybrid genotypes predominates, propagated by cloning. Under subtropical conditions, the planting of single species predominates, propagated by seed. Clonal plantations with interspecific hybrids have been fundamental for eucalypt adaptation in regions under water and nutritional stresses. Given the rapid advances in eucalypt breeding, regarding adaptation to water stress and resistance to diseases and pests, and the adoption of clonal propagation techniques, genotypes are rapidly becoming obsolete and are replaced by more productive ones after harvesting. Thus, the replanting of crops has become a common procedure after the second half of the 1990s in Brazil.
   This paper describes the basic requirements for integrating genetic and silvicultural strategies to minimize abiotic and biotic constraints in eucalypt plantations. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Strategies to enhance access to diagnosis and treatment for Chagas disease patients in Latin America
T2  - EXPERT REVIEW OF ANTI-INFECTIVE THERAPY
AB  - Introduction: Chagas disease, caused by infection with the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, represents a huge public health problem in the Americas, where millions of people are affected. Despite the availability of two drugs against the infection (benznidazole and nifurtimox), multiple factors impede their effective usage: (1) gaps in patient and healthcare provider awareness; (2) lack of access to diagnosis; (3) drug toxicity and absence of treatment algorithms to address adverse effects; (4) failures in drug supply and distribution; and (5) inconsistent drug efficacy against the symptomatic chronic stage. Areas covered: We review new approaches and technologies to enhance access to diagnosis and treatment to reduce the disease burden. We also provide an updated picture of recently published and ongoing anti-T. cruzi drug clinical trials. Although there has been progress improving the research and development (R&D) landscape, it is unclear whether any new treatments will emerge soon. Literature search methodologies included multiple queries to public databases and the use of own-built libraries. Expert opinion: Besides R&D, there is a major need to continue awareness and advocacy efforts by patient associations, local and national governments, and international agencies. Overall, health systems strengthening is essential to ensure vector control commitments, as well as patient access to diagnosis and treatment.

TI  - Genetic Analysis of Invasive <i>Aedes albopictus</i> Populations in Los Angeles County, California and Its Potential Public Health Impact
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - The Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, is an anthropophilic aggressive daytime-biting nuisance and an efficient vector of certain arboviruses and filarial nematodes. Over the last 30 years, this species has spread rapidly through human travel and commerce from its native tropical forests of Asia to every continent except Antarctica. In 2011, a population of Asian tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus) was discovered in Los Angeles (LA) County, California. To determine the probable origin of this invasive species, the genetic structure of the population was compared against 11 populations from the United States and abroad, as well as preserved specimens from a 2001 introduction into California using the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase 1 (CO1) gene. A total of 66 haplotypes were detected among samples and were divided into three main groups. Aedes albopictus collected in 2001 and 2011 from LA County were genetically related and similar to those from Asia but distinct from those collected in the eastern and southeastern United States. In view of the high genetic similarities between the 2001 and 2011 LA samples, it is possible that the 2011 population represents in part the descendants of the 2001 introduction. There remains an imperative need for improved surveillance and control strategies for this species.

TI  - Potential for sylvatic and urban Aedes mosquitoes from Senegal to transmit the new emerging dengue serotypes 1, 3 and 4 in West Africa
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Dengue fever (DEN) is the most common arboviral disease in the world and dengue virus (DENV) causes 390 million annual infections around the world, of which 240 million are inapparent and 96 million are symptomatic. During the past decade a changing epidemiological pattern has been observed in Africa, with DEN outbreaks reported in all regions. In Senegal, all DENV serotypes have been reported. These important changes in the epidemiological profile of DEN are occurring in a context where there is no qualified vaccine against DEN. Further there is significant gap of knowledge on the vector bionomics and transmission dynamics in the African region to effectively prevent and control epidemics. Except for DENV-2, few studies have been performed with serotypes 1, 3, and 4, so this study was undertaken to fill out this gap. We assessed the vector competence of Aedes (Diceromyia) furcifer, Ae. (Diceromyia) taylori, Ae. (Stegomyia) luteocephalus, sylvatic and urban Ae. (Stegomyia) aegypti populations from Senegal for DENV-1, DENV-3 and DENV-4 using experimental oral infection. Whole bodies and wings/legs were tested for DENV presence by cell culture assays and saliva samples were tested by real time RT-PCR to estimate infection, disseminated infection and transmission rates. Our results revealed a low capacity of sylvatic and urban Aedes mosquitoes from Senegal to transmit DENV-1, DENV-3 and DENV-4 and an impact of infection on their mortality. The highest potential transmission rate was 20% despite the high susceptibility and disseminated infection rates up to 93.7% for the 3 Ae. aegypti populations tested, and 84.6% for the sylvatic vectors Ae. furcifer, Ae. taylori and Ae. luteocephalus.
   Author summary Dengue fever remains a major public health problem in all tropical regions of the world and causes 390 million infections each year. In Africa, while dengue outbreaks were rare during the last century, recurrent urban epidemic have been reported in all regions the last decade. Serotype 3, never reported in West Africa, caused major outbreaks in 2009 in several capital cities while serotype 2, usually confined to the forest cycle, spilled over into urban areas in Senegal and Mauritania in 2014-2015. These changes are occurring in a context where vector control remains the only effective approach to prevent and control epidemics. However, the design and the implementation of efficient vector control require an accurate knowledge of the vector bionomics and competence while such data are lacking in the African region. To fill out this gap we experimentally infected domestic and wild mosquitoes from Senegal to assess their vector competence for dengue serotypes 1, 3 and 4. Finally both domestic and wild Senegalese mosquitoes showed a low ability to transmit dengue viruses.

TI  - Observations on <i>Haemagogus janthinomys</i> Dyar (Diptera: Culicidae) and other Mosquito Populations within Tree Holes in a Gallery Forest in the Northwestern Region of Sao Paulo State, Brazil
T2  - NEOTROPICAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - In 2000, an outbreak of sylvatic yellow fever possibly occurred in gallery forests of the Grande river in the Parana basin in the northwestern region of Sao Paulo state. The aim of this study was to obtain information on the bionomics of Haemagogus and other mosquitoes inside tree holes in that area. Eighteen open tree holes were sampled for immature specimens. Adults were collected twice a month in the forest in Santa Albertina county from July 2000 to June 2001. The seasonal frequency of fourth instars was obtained by the Williams geometric mean (Mw), while the adult frequency was estimated either by hourly arithmetic or the Williams' means. Cole's index was applied to evaluate larval inter-specific associations. Among the ten mosquito species identified, the most abundant was Aedes terrens Walker followed by Sabethes tridentatus Cerqueira and Haemagogus janthinomys Dyar. Larval and adult abundance of these species was higher in summer than in winter. Although larval abundance offIg.janthinomys peaked in the rainy season, correlation with rainfall was not significant. Six groups of larval associations were distinguished, one of which the most positively stable. The Hg. janthinomys and Ac. terrens association was significant, and Limatus durhamii Theobald was the species with most negative associations.

TI  - The effects of neighbouring tree islands on pollinator density and diversity, and on pollination of a wet prairie species, <i>Asclepias lanceolata</i> (Apocynaceae)
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
AB  - The Everglades (Florida, USA) is a mosaic of different habitats. Tropical and temperate trees grow on patches of high ground (tree islands) surrounded by lower elevation wetland communities (marl prairie).
   Tree islands of various sizes provide nesting substrate, larval host plants and floral resources for insect pollinators. Herbaceous plants in the open surrounding wetlands may also depend on these pollinators.
   We investigated pollinator diversity and abundances in both tree island and marl prairie habitats using transect sampling methods and estimated pollination success of the milkweed Asclepias lanceolata, an insect-pollinated marl prairie species, in relation to distance from and size of the closest tree island.
   On a total of 11 bayhead tree islands, we found that insect diversity and abundance were greater on the edge of larger tree islands (20-30 m(2)) than on smaller tree islands (5-10 m(2)). Pollinator diversity and abundance in the marl prairie decreased with increasing distance from tree islands.
   Pairs of potted A. lanceolata plants were placed in the marl prairie at distances up to 1000 m from small and large tree islands. Fruit and seed production were highest for plants placed less than 25 m from tree islands and decreased with increasing distance.
   Our results suggest that tree islands are an important source of pollinators for the plants in the tree island and surrounding wetland habitats.
   This landscape-based study illustrates how overall landscape structure affects important biotic interactions, particularly plant-pollinator relationships. Our findings have far-reaching ecological implications for the reproductive success of plants in small, isolated populations that may depend on insect vectors for pollination.

TI  - SHIFTING HERBIVORY PATTERN DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGE: A CASE STUDY OF HIMALAYAN BALSAM FROM PAKISTAN
T2  - PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
AB  - Pests, diseases and weeds cause significant impact on crops and natural vegetation each year. Climate change is likely to cause a spread of tropical and sub-tropical species into temperate areas and to increase the numbers of many temperate species currently limited by low temperatures at high altitudes. The potential expansion of geographical ranges of pest species will be disruptive to quarantine barriers and is likely to result in increased damage to crops and natural vegetation in previously pest free areas. Elm Leaf Beetle Pyrrhalta luteola (Mueller) is been reported to increase due to 0.3 degrees C rise in temperature and 3-4% decrease in rainfall in the Moist Himalayan Forest of Pakistan. The insect attacks Impatience gladulifera Royle., a plant of medicinal importance. The plant is not only used in a variety of local medicines but is also one of the important constituent of undergrowth natural vegetation in these forests. During the last 10 years the leaf damaged cased by the insect is on a hike and has increased up to 85%.

Recently, there has been a resurgence of withering in different forestry areas, which represents a serious threat to the profitability and survival of forest plantations. A study has been undertaken to resolve this problem. Plant samples were collected from the trunk (bark, sapwood and central cylinder) and the roots for fungal microflora analysis through in vitro cultures to identify the causative agent of the decay of healthy trees. Sixteen different fungal genera were selected, including two species responsible for teak disease: Verticillium sp. with 82% and 98% frequencies and Fomes sp. with 79% and 60% frequencies, respectively in the roots and trunks of the diseased teaks. The presence of fungi was recorded as Verticillium sp. in 30% of diseased trees, Fomes sp. in 7.5% and all species combined in 70.5% of the cases. The inoculation of young seedling teaks in semi-controlled environment with isolates of different species of fungi allowed the restoration of the infection over 73.3% of the plants with Verticillium sp. and 16.4% with Fomes sp. The study recorded, for the first time, Verticillium sp. responsible for teak decay in plantation and reforestation (semi deciduous dense forest environment) in Cote d'Ivoire. Very often the causes of teak and forest species decay associated with fungi are attributed by error to Fomes sp., ignoring a formidable decay agent in forestry, the Verticillium sp. The lack of knowledge and information on the real causality of teak decay, associated with fungi, could make fungicidal treatments, for control of wood tree diseases, difficult and unsuccessful.

TI  - ECTOPARASITIC FAUNA OF BIRDS, AND VOLANT AND NON-VOLANT SMALL MAMMALS CAPTURED AT SRINAKARIN DAM, KANCHANABURI, THAILAND
T2  - SOUTHEAST ASIAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - The investigation of ectoparasitic fauna on birds, and volant and non-volant small mammals at Srinakarin Dam, Kanchanaburi Province, Thailand was carried out under a national biodiversity and disease surveillance program for four consecutive months: January, February, May and June 2009. A total of 122 animals, comprised of 15 species of birds, 9 species of volant small mammals and 8 species of non-volant small mammals were examined for ectoparasite infestation. Of these animals, 1 genus of hard ticks (Ixodidae), 2 species of mesostigmatid mites (Laelapidae), 4 genera in three families of astigmatid mites (Proctophyllodidae, Pteronyssidae and Trouessartiidae), 4 species in three families of lice (Philopteridae, Polyplacidae and Trichodectidae) and 2 families of batflies (Nycteribiidae and Streblidae) were collected. This is the first survey conducted to determine ectoparasites infesting birds and small mammals living in the reserved forest of Srinakarin Dam, Thailand. A lower infestation rate of ectoparasites was observed in mammals, ranging from 3.5% to 10.3% than birds, with infestation rates between 7.3% and 34.2%. No major potential health risks to people who lived in this area were found.

TI  - Comparative Metagenomics of Palearctic and Neotropical Avian Cloacal Viromes Reveal Geographic Bias in Virus Discovery
T2  - MICROORGANISMS
AB  - Our understanding about viruses carried by wild animals is still scarce. The viral diversity of wildlife may be best described with discovery-driven approaches to the study of viral diversity that broaden research efforts towards non-canonical hosts and remote geographic regions. Birds have been key organisms in the transmission of viruses causing important diseases, and wild birds are threatened by viral spillovers associated with human activities. However, our knowledge of the avian virome may be biased towards poultry and highly pathogenic diseases. We describe and compare the fecal virome of two passerine-dominated bird assemblages sampled in a remote Neotropical rainforest in French Guiana (Nouragues Natural Reserve) and a Mediterranean forest in central Spain (La Herreria). We used metagenomic data to quantify the degree of functional and genetic novelty of viruses recovered by examining if the similarity of the contigs we obtained to reference sequences differed between both locations. In general, contigs from Nouragues were significantly less similar to viruses in databases than contigs from La Herreria using Blastn but not for Blastx, suggesting that pristine regions harbor a yet unknown viral diversity with genetically more singular viruses than more studied areas. Additionally, we describe putative novel viruses of the families Picornaviridae, Reoviridae and Hepeviridae. These results highlight the importance of wild animals and remote regions as sources of novel viruses that substantially broaden the current knowledge of the global diversity of viruses.

TI  - Spatial prediction of risk areas for vector transmission of <i>Trypanosoma cruzi</i> in the State of Parana, southern Brazil
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - After obtaining certification of the absence of transmission of the Trypanosoma cruzi by Triatoma infestans in 2006, other native species of protozoan vectors have been found in human dwellings within municipalities of the State of Parana, Southern Brazil. However, the spatial distribution of T. cruzi vectors and how climatic and landscape combined variables explain the distribution are still poorly understood. The goal of this study was to predict the potential distribution of T. cruzi vectors as a proxy for Chagas disease transmission risk using Ecological Niche Models (ENMs) based on climatic and landscape variables. We hypothesize that ENM based on both climate and landscape variables are more powerful than climate-only or landscape-only models, and that this will be true independent of vector species. A total of 2,662 records of triatomines of five species were obtained by community-based entomological surveillance from 2007 to 2013. The species with the highest number of specimens was Panstrongylus megistus (73%; n = 1,943), followed by Panstrongylus geniculatus (15.4%; 411), Rhodnius neglectus (6.0%; 159), Triatoma sordida (4.5%; 119) and Rhodnius prolixus (1.1%; 30). Of the total, 71.9% were captured at the intradomicile. T. cruzi infection was observed in 19.7% of the 2,472 examined insects. ENMs were generated based on selected climate and landscape variables with 1 km(2) spatial resolution. Zonal statistics were used for classifying the municipalities as to the risk of occurrence of synanthropic triatomines. The integrated analysis of the climate and landscape suitability on triatomines geographical distribution was powerful on generating good predictive models. Moreover, this showed that some municipalities in the northwest, north and northeast of the Parana state have a higher risk of T. cruzivector transmission. This occurs because those regions present high climatic and landscape suitability values for occurrence of their vectors. The frequent invasion of houses by infected triatomines clearly indicates a greater risk of transmission of T. cruzi to the inhabitants. More public health attention should be given in the northern areas of the State of Parana, which presents high climate and landscape suitabilities for the disease vectors. In conclusion, our results through spatial analysis and predictive maps showed to be effective in identifying areas of potential distribution and, consequently, in the definition of strategic areas and actions to prevent new cases of Chagas' disease, reinforcing the need for continuous and robust surveillance in these areas.

TI  - Contribution of <i>Anopheles funestus, An. gambiae</i> and <i>An. nili</i> (Diptera: Culicidae) to the perennial malaria transmission in the southern and western forest areas of Cote d'Ivoire
T2  - ANNALS OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND PARASITOLOGY
AB  - The involvement of members of the Anopheles gambiae complex Giles and An. funestus Giles and An. nili Theobald groups in the transmission of Plasmodium falciparum was recently investigated in the villages of Gbatta and Kpehiri, which lie, respectively, in forest areas in the west and south of Cote d'Ivoire.
   Adult female mosquitoes were collected, using human landing catches, inside and outside dwellings. After identification and dissection, the heads and thoraces of all the anopheline mosquitoes were tested, in an ELISA, for circumsporozoite protein (CSP). All the female anopheline mosquitoes collected and identified to species using PCR were found to be An. gambiae s.s., An. nili s.s. or An. funestus s.s., with An. gambiae s.s. and An. funestus s.s. predominant in Gbatta but An. nili s.s. the most common species in Kpehiri. In Gbatta, 3.1% of the female An. gambiae collected, 5.0% of the female An. funestus and 1.8% of the female An. nili were found CSP-positive. The corresponding values in Kpehiri were even higher, at 5.9%, 6.2% and 2.4%, respectively. The estimated entomological inoculation rates (EIR) were very high: 302 infected bites (139 from An. gambiae, 146 from An. funestus and 17 from An. nili)/person-year in Gbatta and 484 infected bites (204 from An. gambiae, 70 from An. funestus and 210 from An. nili)/person-year in Kpehiri.
   In Gbatta, An. gambiae s.s. was responsible for most of the rainy-season transmission while An. funestus became the main malaria vector in the dry seasons. In Kpehiri, however, An. nili appeared to be the main vector throughout the year, with An. gambiae of secondary importance and An. funestus only becoming a significant vector during the rainy season. Although, in both study sites, intense transmission was therefore occurring and the same three species of anopheline mosquito were present, the relative importance of each mosquito species in the epidemiology of the human malaria at each site differed markedly.

TI  - Predictive pollen-based biome modeling using machine learning
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - This paper investigates suitability of supervised machine learning classification methods for classification of biomes using pollen datasets. We assign modern pollen samples from Africa and Arabia to five biome classes using a previously published African pollen dataset and a global ecosystem classification scheme. To test the applicability of traditional and machine-learning based classification models for the task of biome prediction from high dimensional modern pollen data, we train a total of eight classification models, including Linear Discriminant Analysis, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, Classification Decision Tree, Random Forest, Neural Network, and Support Vector Machine. The ability of each model to predict biomes from pollen data is statistically tested on an independent test set. The Random Forest classifier outperforms other models in its ability correctly classify biomes given pollen data. Out of the eight models, the Random Forest classifier scores highest on all of the metrics used for model evaluations and is able to predict four out of five biome classes to high degree of accuracy, including arid, montane, tropical and subtropical closed and open systems, e.g. forests and savanna/grassland. The model has the potential for accurate reconstructions of past biomes and awaits application to fossil pollen sequences. The Random Forest model may be used to investigate vegetation changes on both long and short time scales, e.g. during glacial and interglacial cycles, or more recent and abrupt climatic anomalies like the African Humid Period. Such applications may contribute to a better understanding of past shifts in vegetation cover and ultimately provide valuable information on drivers of climate change.

TI  - Soil parent material prediction for Brazil via proximal soil sensing
T2  - GEODERMA REGIONAL
AB  - Parent material (PM) is key in the thorough understanding of soils. However, the complexity of PM distributions and the difficulty of reaching PM in deep soils prevent its detailed assessment. Proximal sensors, such as the por table X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (pXRF), might ease this process. This work attempts to prove the potential of pXRF to predict different PMs from analyses of soil samples. The study encompassed five Brazilian states representing 1,541,309.409 km(2), from where 310 soil samples of various soil classes derived from 12 different PMs were collected and analyzed by PXRF. Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms were used for modeling. Modeling comprised three datasets: one containing all data (310 samples), a dataset with younger soils (151 samples) and one with older soils, conceptually less influenced by their PM (159 samples), to understand how soil-PM chemical proximity affects prediction performance, assessed via overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient. Data distribution showed pXRF can discriminate PM types via their resulting soils, regardless of the degree of weathering. Prediction results were prominent: RF and SVM achieved roughly 0.9 Kappa and overall accuracy predicting all data. For the remaining datasets, SVM achieved 0.96 Kappa and RF nearly 0.92 for younger soils, and 0.87 and 0.9, respectively, for older soils, confirming that PMs of younger soils are slightly easier to predict, but even soils heavily altered by pedogenetic processes can be accurately predicted. Results confirm the pXRF potential to predict PM from soil data, which might help in soil mapping and its consequent activities in tropical conditions. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - <i>Plasmodium simium</i>: Population Genomics Reveals the Origin of a Reverse Zoonosis
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB  - Background. The population history of Plasmodium simium, which causes malaria in sylvatic Neotropical monkeys and humans along the Atlantic Coast of Brazil, remains disputed. Genetically diverse P vivax populations from various sources, including the lineages that founded the species P simium, are thought to have arrived in the Americas in separate migratory waves.
   Methods. We use population genomic approaches to investigate the origin and evolution of P simium.
   Results. We find a minimal genome-level differentiation between P simium and present-day New World P vivax isolates, consistent with their common geographic origin and subsequent divergence on this continent. The meagre genetic diversity in P simium samples from humans and monkeys implies a recent transfer from humans to non-human primates - a unique example of malaria as a reverse zoonosis of public health significance. Likely genomic signatures of P simium adaptation to new hosts include the deletion of > 40% of a key erythrocyte invasion ligand, PvRBP2a, which may have favored more efficient simian host cell infection.
   Conclusions. New World P vivax lineages that switched from humans to platyrrhine monkeys founded the P simium population that infects nonhuman primates and feeds sustained human malaria transmission in the outskirts of major cities.

TI  - "Chiclero's Ulcer" Due to <i>Leishmania mexicana</i> in Travelers Returning from Central America: A Case Report and Review of the Literature
T2  - PATHOGENS
AB  - Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) due to a New World species of Leishmania is increasingly seen among returning international travelers, and most cases arise from travel to Mexico, Central and South America. We described a case of CL in a women presenting a nonhealing ulceration under her right ear with slight increase of size of the left parotid gland under the skin lesion, evolving for 4 months. In her history of travel, she reported a ten-day stay in Mexico during the Christmas vacation in the Yucatan region with only half a day walking in the tropical forest. Diagnosis of CL due to Leishmania mexicana was done via PCR detection and sequencing from swab sampling of the lesion. The patient recovered without antiparasitic treatment. Clinicians should consider diagnosing Chiclero's ulcer in patients returning from endemic areas such as Central America and Texas who present with chronic ulceration. A noninvasive sampling is sufficient for the PCR-based diagnosis of this disease.

TI  - On palms, bugs, and Chagas disease in the Americas
T2  - ACTA TROPICA
AB  - Palms are ubiquitous across Neotropical landscapes, from pristine forests or savannahs to large cities. Although palms provide useful ecosystem services, they also offer suitable habitat for triatomines and for Trypanosoma cruzi mammalian hosts. Wild triatomines often invade houses by flying from nearby palms, potentially leading to new cases of human Chagas disease. Understanding and predicting triatomine-palm associations and palm infestation probabilities is important for enhancing Chagas disease prevention in areas where palm-associated vectors transmit T. cruzi. We present a comprehensive overview of palm infestation by triatomines in the Americas, combining a thorough reanalysis of our published and unpublished records with an in-depth review of the literature. We use site-occupancy modeling (SOM) to examine infestation in 3590 palms sampled with non-destructive methods, and standard statistics to describe and compare infestation in 2940 palms sampled by felling-and-dissection. Thirty-eight palm species (18 genera) have been reported to be infested by similar to 39 triatomine species (10 genera) from the USA to Argentina. Overall infestation varied from 49.1-55.3% (SUM) to 62.6-66.1% (dissection), with important heterogeneities among sub-regions and particularly among palm species. Large palms with complex crowns (e.g., Attalea butyracea, Acrocomia aculeata) and some medium-crowned palms (e.g., Copernicia, Butia) are often infested; in slender, small-crowned palms (e.g., Euterpe) triatomines associate with vertebrate nests. Palm infestation tends to be higher in rural settings, but urban palms can also be infested. Most Rhodnius species are probably true palm specialists, whereas Psammolestes, Eratyrus, Cavernicola, Panstrongylus, Triatoma, Alberprosenia, and some Bolboderini seem to use palms opportunistically. Palms provide extensive habitat for enzootic T. cruzi cycles and a critical link between wild cycles and transmission to humans. Unless effective means to reduce contact between people and palm-living triatomines are devised, palms will contribute to maintaining long-term and widespread, albeit possibly low-intensity, transmission of human Chagas disease.

TI  - Unlocking the potential of snake venom-based molecules against the malaria, Chagas disease, and leishmaniasis triad
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL MACROMOLECULES
AB  - Malaria, leishmaniasis and Chagas disease are vector-borne protozoal infections with a disproportionately high impact on the most fragile societies in the world, and despite malaria-focused research gained momentum in the past two decades, both trypanosomiases and leishmaniases remain neglected tropical diseases. Affordable effective drugs remain the mainstay of tackling this burden, but toxicicty, inneficiency against later stage disease, and drug resistance issues are serious shortcomings. One strategy to overcome these hurdles is to get new therapeutics or inspiration in nature. Indeed, snake venoms have been recognized as valuable sources of biomacromolecules, like peptides and proteins, with antiprotozoal activity. This review highlights major snake venom components active against at least one of the three aforementioned diseases, which include phospholipases A2, metalloproteases, L-amino acid oxidases, lectins, and oligopeptides. The relevance of this repertoire of biomacromolecules and the bottlenecks in their clinical translation are discussed considering approaches that should increase the success rate in this arduous task. Overall, this review underlines how venom-derived biomacromolecules could lead to pioneering antiprotozoal treatments and how the drug landscape for neglected diseases may be revolutionized by a closer look at venoms. Further investigations on poorly studied venoms is needed and could add new therapeutics to the pipeline.

TI  - Natural sesquiterpene lactones induce programmed cell death in <i>Trypanosoma cruzi</i>: A new therapeutic target?
T2  - PHYTOMEDICINE
AB  - Background: Chagas disease or American Trypanosomiasis is caused by the flagellated protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi) and is recognized by the WHO as one of the world's 17 neglected tropical diseases. Only two drugs (Benznidazol, Bz and Nifurtimox, Nx) are currently accepted for treatment, however they cause severe adverse effects and their efficacy is still controversial. It is then important to explore for new, drugs.
   Purpose: Programmed cell death (PCD) in parasites offers interesting new therapeutic targets. The aim of this work was to evaluate the induction of PCD in T. cruzi by two natural sesquiterpene lactones (STLs), dehydroleucodine (DhL) and helenalin (Hln) as compared with the two conventional drugs, Bz and Nx.
   Material and Methods: Hln and DhL were isolated from aerial parts of Gaillardia megapotamica and Artemisia douglassiana Besser, respectively. Purity of compounds (greater than 95%) was confirmed by C-13-nuclear magnetic resonance, melting point analysis, and optical rotation. Induction of PCD in T. cruzi epimastigotes and trypomastigotes by DhL, Hln, Bz and Nx was assayed by phosphatidylserine exposure at the parasite surface and by detection of DNA fragmentation using the TUNEL assay. Trypanocidal activity of natural and synthetic compounds was assayed by measuring parasite viability using the MTT method.
   Results: The two natural STLs, DhL and Hln, induce programmed cell death in both, the replicative epimastigote form and the infective trypomastigote form of T. cruzi. Interestingly, the two conventional antichagasic drugs (Bz and Nx) do not induce programmed cell death. A combination of DhL and either Bz or Nx showed an increased effect of natural compounds and synthetic drugs on the decrease of parasite viability.
   Conclusion: DhL and Hln induce programmed cell death in T. cruzi replicative epimastigote and infective trypomastigote forms, which is a different mechanism of action than the conventional drugs to kill the parasite. Therefore DhL and Hln may offer an interesting option for the treatment of Chagas disease, alone or in combination with conventional drugs. (C) 2014 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

TI  - Delineation of high resolution climate regions over the Korean Peninsula using machine learning approaches
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - In this research, climate classification maps over the Korean Peninsula at 1 km resolution were generated using the satellite-based climatic variables of monthly temperature and precipitation based on machine learning approaches. Random forest (RF), artificial neural networks (ANN), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), logistic regression (LR), and support vector machines (SVM) were used to develop models. Training and validation of these models were conducted using in-situ observations from the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) from 2001 to 2016. The rule of the traditional Koppen-Geiger (K-G) climate classification was used to classify climate regions. The input variables were land surface temperature (LST) of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), monthly precipitation data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3B43 product, and the Digital Elevation Map (DEM) from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM). The overall accuracy (OA) based on validation data from 2001 to 2016 for all models was high over 95%. DEM and minimum winter temperature were two distinct variables over the study area with particularly high relative importance. ANN produced more realistic spatial distribution of the classified climates despite having a slightly lower OA than the others. The accuracy of the models using high altitudinal in-situ data of the Mountain Meteorology Observation System (MMOS) was also assessed. Although the data length of the MMOS data was relatively short (2013 to 2017), it proved that the snowy, dry and cold winter and cool summer class (Dwc) is widely located in the eastern coastal region of South Korea. Temporal shifting of climate was examined through a comparison of climate maps produced by period: from 1950 to 2000, from 1983 to 2000, and from 2001 to 2013. A shrinking trend of snow classes (D) over the Korean Peninsula was clearly observed from the ANN-based climate classification results. Shifting trends of climate with the decrease/increase of snow (D)/temperate (C) classes were clearly shown in the maps produced using the proposed approaches, consistent with the results from the reanalysis data of the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) and Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC).

TI  - Self-organizing maps of typhoon tracks allow for flood forecasts up to two days in advance
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB  - Typhoons are among the greatest natural hazards along East Asian coasts. Typhoon-related precipitation can produce flooding that is often only predictable a few hours in advance. Here, we present a machine-learning method comparing projected typhoon tracks with past trajectories, then using the information to predict flood hydrographs for a watershed on Taiwan. The hydrographs provide early warning of possible flooding prior to typhoon landfall, and then real-time updates of expected flooding along the typhoon's path. The method associates different types of typhoon tracks with landscape topography and runoff data to estimate the water inflow into a reservoir, allowing prediction of flood hydrographs up to two days in advance with continual updates. Modelling involves identifying typhoon track vectors, clustering vectors using a self-organizing map, extracting flow characteristic curves, and predicting flood hydrographs. This machine learning approach can significantly improve existing flood warning systems and provide early warnings to reservoir management. Tropical cyclones can cause severe flooding when making landfall, but these water flows can often only be forecasted a few hours before. Here, the authors present a new approach using self-organizing maps and flow characteristic curves to predict tropical cyclone related runoff up to two days in advance.

TI  - Diagnostics to support the control of scabies-Development of two target product profiles
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   Scabies was added to the WHO NTD portfolio in 2017 and targets for the control of scabies were included in the 2021-2030 WHO NTD roadmap. A major component of scabies control efforts a strategy based on mass drug administration (MDA) with ivermectin. Currently diagnosis of scabies relies on clinical examination with a limited role for diagnostic testing. Under the recommendation of the WHO Diagnostic Technical Advisory Group (DTAG) for Neglected Tropical Diseases, a working group was assembled and tasked with agreeing on priority use cases for and developing target product profiles (TPPs) for new diagnostics tools for scabies.
   Methodology and principal findings
   The working group convened three times and established two use cases: establishing if the 10% threshold for mass drug administration had been reached and if the 2% threshold for stopping mass drug administration has been achieved. One subgroup assessed the current diagnostic landscape for scabies and a second subgroup determined the test requirements for both use cases. Draft TPPs were sent out for input from stakeholders and experts. Both TPPs considered the following parameters: product use, design, performance, configuration, cost, access and equity. The group considered the use of the tests as a single step process or as part of a two step process following initial clinical examination. When used a single step test (the ideal scenario) for starting MDA a new diagnostic required a sensitivity of >= 92% and a specificity of >= 98%. When used a single step test (the ideal scenario) for stopping MDA a new diagnostic required a sensitivity of >= 80% and a specificity of >= 99%.
   Conclusions
   The TPPs developed will provide test developers with guidance to ensure that novel diagnostic tests meet identified public health needs.

TI  - American Tegumentary Leishmaniasis in the Brazilian Amazon from 2010 to 2014
T2  - REVISTA DO INSTITUTO DE MEDICINA TROPICAL DE SAO PAULO
AB  - American tegumentary leishmaniasis (ATL) is one of the most important but neglected infectious diseases, and can cause severe deformities. ATL incidence remains high in forest regions, such as in the Amazonas State, Brazil. However, differences within the State and over time have been observed, since infection patterns are not homogeneous, and these aspects need to be clarified. This study aimed to identify the epidemiological profile of ATL and its spatial and temporal distribution in the Brazilian Amazon, from 2010 to 2014. Data were extracted from the Information System for Notifiable Diseases, which descriptively evaluates the incidence rate, as well as the temporal and spatial distribution of the disease. The highest prevalence of ATL was found in men and in the age group of 20-40 years. Approximately 95% of the cases were of cutaneous ATL and they were identified through direct examination. The spatial analysis has shown that ATL was widely distributed, both in rural and urban areas, and more concentrated in the Southern part of the State. Moreover, although there was an expansion in the spatial distribution and an increasing incidence of ATL in Amazonas, the epidemiological profile remained unchanged, suggesting that other factors must be responsible for its widespread distribution and increasing incidence.

TI  - Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imaging and machine learning applications for plant phenotyping
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
AB  - The availability of timely and accurate information about plant conditions is critical for making informed de-cisions for maintaining or improving agricultural productivity. However, field data collection is often laborious and time-consuming, underscoring the need for accurate and efficient methods to monitor crop growth and development. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of combining unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based imaging and machine learning (ML) techniques for monitoring sweet corn (Zea mays var. saccharata) height, biomass, and yield. The study was conducted at the Tropical Research and Education Center (TREC) during the winter (dry) season of 2020-2021 using 16 experimental plots planted with sweet corn. The treatments were set up in a completely randomized block design (RCBD) with four irrigation treatments of 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% full irrigation with four replications each. Field data collection included plant height, fresh and dry biomass, and yield. In addition, UAV images were collected using the DJI Matrice 210 v2 UAV (SZ DJI Technology Co., Ltd., Shenzhen, China) equipped with a MicaSense RedEdge-MX multispectral sensor (MicaSense, Seattle, WA, USA). Image processing was done with Pix4Dmapper 4.7.5 (Pix4D S.A., Prilly, Switzerland). A crop surface model, representing estimated plant height (UAVH), was calculated based on pixel -to-pixel differences between digital surface and terrain models. A simple linear regression model was used to estimate sweet corn biomass and yield from UAV images estimated plant height (UAVH). In addition, two linear algorithms known as a linear model (LM) and Lasso and elastic-net regularized generalized linear model (GLMNET) and three non-linear ML algorithms including random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and k-nearest neighbor (kNN) were used to predict plant height and biomass. These algorithms were chosen due to their reliable performance and ability to learn complex non-linear relationships. Eight vegetation indices with UAVH were also used to evaluate the ML models' performance to predict plant height and biomass. Results confirmed that UAV imaging could be effectively used to estimate plant height (d = 0.99, r2 = 0.99, and MAE = 5 cm). Estimated fresh and dry biomass from UAV imaging also had good agreements with measured data with r2 values of 0.75 and 0.70, respectively. A statistically significant linear correlation between measured fresh yield at harvest and UAVH was found with d, adjusted r2, and MAE of 0.84, 0.66, and 67 g m- 2, respectively. Evaluation of ML algorithms revealed that all models performed well for plant biomass estimation with d values between 0.88 and 0.99. However, the kNN and SVM outperformed all other models for biomass estimation. GMLNET performed better than other models for plant height estimation. Overall, results revealed that UAV imaging and ML models could be effectively used for monitoring plant phenotypic characteristics such as height, yield, and biomass.

TI  - Untangling cryptic diversity in the High Andes: Revision of the <i>Scytalopus</i> [<i>magellanicus</i>] complex (Rhinocryptidae) in Peru reveals three new species
T2  - AUK
AB  - Tropical mountains feature marked species turnover along elevational gradients and across complex topography, resulting in great concentrations of avian biodiversity. In these landscapes, particularly among morphologically conserved and difficult to observe avian groups, species limits still require clarification. One such lineage is Scytalopus tapaculos, which are among the morphologically most conserved birds. Attention to their distinctive vocal repertoires and phylogenetic relationships has resulted in a proliferation of newly identified species, many of which are restricted range endemics. Here, we present a revised taxonomy and identify species limits among high-elevation populations of Scytalopus tapaculos inhabiting the Peruvian Andes. We employ an integrated framework using a combination of vocal information, mitochondrial DNA sequences, and appearance, gathered from our own fieldwork over the past 40 yr and supplemented with community-shared birdsong archives and museum specimens. We describe 3 new species endemic to Peru. Within all 3 of these species there is genetic differentiation, which in 2 species is mirrored by subtle geographic plumage and vocal variation. In a fourth species, Scytalopus schulenbergi, we document deep genetic divergence and plumage differences despite overall vocal similarity. We further propose that an extralimital taxon, Scytalopus opacus androsrictus, be elevated to species rank, based on a diagnostic vocal character. Our results demonstrate that basic exploration and descriptive work using diverse data sources continues to identify new species of birds, particularly in tropical environs.

TI  - Environmental determinants of <i>Opisthorchis viverrini</i> prevalence in northeast Thailand
T2  - GEOSPATIAL HEALTH
AB  - Opisthorchis viverrini infection is an important, human, parasitic disease along the middle and lower Mekong River of Southeast Asia. Despite vast efforts in epidemiological research, the wide geographical variation in O. viverrini prevalence remains unexplained. To investigate the potential influence of village location, prevalence data recorded during the year 2009 for 90 villages in northeast Thailand were analysed by a geographical information systems approach based on a digital elevation model for altitude determination. Land use compositions of village surroundings were derived from images produced by the Thematic Mapper of the Landsat satellite and landscape metrics were applied to quantify spatial patterns. Pearson's correlation coefficients were used to evaluate the associations between the environmental factors and O. viverrini prevalence. In spite of no statistical difference (P = 0.117), higher-ground villages generally had a lower level of opisthorchiasis than those situated lower down, while a significant negative correlation was detected between O. viverrini prevalence and the composition of farmland with low water content (P = 0.028), indicating the potential influence of agricultural lands with drought-tolerant crops. Strengthening this hypothesis, a significant positive association with O. viverrini prevalence was found for the combined land use classes of water and of farmland with high water content (P = 0.032), indicating that the dominance of a large land use patch capable of providing suitable habitats for the intermediate hosts might contribute to the disease. This study highlights the influence of landscapes on the epidemiology of O. viverrini infection and emphasises the need to incorporate land use planning into control strategies.

TI  - Co-endemicity of Loiasis and Onchocerciasis in Rain Forest Communities in Southwestern Nigeria
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   Loiasis is currently receiving attention as a disease of public health importance because of the possibility of increased risk of developing neurologic serious adverse event following mass ivermectin treatment against onchocerciasis in individual co-infected with Onchocerca volvulus and Loa loa.
   Methodology/Principal Findings
   Rapid assessment procedure for loiasis (RAPLOA) was conducted in 12 communities covering the 3 senatorial districts of Osun State, Nigeria. A total of 960 people were interviewed for history of eye worm using the WHO guidelines for rapid assessment. The survey confirmed the presence of loiasis in all the 12 communities with 4 in Osun East/Ife south senatorial district being at high risk with a prevalence of over 40%. Based on the RAPLOA results, communities within Osun East/Ife south senatorial district were selected for microfilaraemic assessment of L. loa and O. volvulus. A total of 1115 and 1091 individuals were screened for L. loa and O. volvulus microfilaria worms respectively. 160 (14.3%) had L. loa microfilaria detected in their blood with 8 (5.0%) individuals having L. loa loads above 8000 mf/ml. 166 (15.2%) subjects had O. volvulus microfilaria (range 4-504 mf/ml) detected in their skin snip. 30 (2.69%) subjects were co-infected with both L. loa and O. volvulus. There was a significant variation in the prevalence (2.1% to 33.3%) of onchocerciasis in the communities studied (p = 0.001). Five (41.7%) of the studied communities had a prevalence that is equal to or greater than 20%.
   Conclusions/Significance
   Low prevalence of onchocerciasis and loiasis co-infection in this study suggests that loiasis may not pose a serious epidemiological threat to the continuous distribution and sustainability of ivermectin for the treatment of onchocerciasis. Evaluation of the interruption of onchocerciasis transmissions in this region using all the indicators set forth by WHO is therefore suggested.

TI  - Risk Factors for African Tick-Bite Fever in Rural Central Africa
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - African tick-bite fever is an emerging infectious disease caused by the spotted fever group Rickettsia, Rickettsia africae, and is transmitted by ticks of the genus Amblyomma. To determine the seroprevalence of exposure to R. africae and risk factors associated with infection, we conducted a cross-sectional study of persons in seven rural villages in distinct ecological habitats of Cameroon. We examined 903 plasma samples by using an indirect immunofluorescence assay for antibodies to R. africae and analyzed demographic and occupational data collected from questionnaires. Of the 903 persons tested, 243 (26.9%) had IgG/IgM/IgA reactive with R. africae. Persons from four of the seven village sites were significantly more likely to be seropositive (P < 0.05), and lowland forest sites tended to have higher seroprevalences. These results suggest that African tick-bite fever is common in adults in rural areas of Cameroon and that ecological factors may play a role in the acquisition of R. africae infection.

TI  - Lymphatic filariasis in Asia: a systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - PARASITOLOGY RESEARCH
AB  - Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is an important neglected parasitic disease according to the World Health Organization. In this study, we aimed to determine the prevalence of human LF in Asia using a systematic review and meta-analysis approach. Records from 1990 to 2018 in reputable databases including PubMed, Science Direct, Embase, and Cochrane Library were searched using a panel of related keywords. All 48 countries of Asia were searched one by one in combination with the keywords. In all, 41,742 cases identified in this study were included in the analysis. According to our findings, the pooled prevalence of LF in Asia was estimated at 3% (95% CI: [1.7, 5.2]). There was no major trend in the cumulative prevalence of LF over time. Some countries in Asia including China, Japan, Vietnam, and South Korea succeeded in eliminating LF as a public health problem, but others still need to monitor the disease. Based on the initiative of the WHO starting in 2000, some countries in Asia succeeded in eliminating LF as a public health problem. Other countries have taken steps to eliminate the disease with variable degrees of success. These efforts might be affected by issues such as climate change.

TI  - New host records of Cerambycidae (Coleoptera) from central Mexico
T2  - PAN-PACIFIC ENTOMOLOGIST
AB  - Longhorn beetles (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) feed during their larval stage on wood from recently dead or diseased trees and may have a wide variety of hosts. However, reports of larval hosts for Cerambycidae could be misinterpreted from field observations. The use of freshly cut branches to attract longhorn beetles is a method that provides reliable information about which hosts they use. This study reports new records of larval hosts of longhorn beetles in the tropical dry forest of San Andres de la Cal, Morelos, Mexico. In the study area, species of woody plants were sampled, from each of which sections of branches were cut and left exposed to local field conditions for two months to attract beetles. Branches were later collected and placed in emergence chambers. A total of 26 species of Cerambycidae emerged from the branches of 51 species of woody plants of the families Apocynaceae, Araliaceae, Burseraceae, Celastraceae, Convolvulaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Fabaceae, Juglandaceae, Malpighiaceae, Malvaceae, Moraceae, Oleaceae and Rubiaceae. For all 26 cerambycid species, we found previously unreported hosts, and for nine species, the hosts we report are the first recorded in the literature. The nine species whose host relationships have not been previously reported are: Euderces basimactdatus Giesbert & Chemsak 1997; E. pulcher (Bates, 1874); Elytroleptus grandis Linsley 1935; Areocompsa puncticollis asperula (Bates, 1885); Acanthoderes (Pardalisia) lacrymans (Thomson, 1865); Olenosus serrunanus Bates, 1872; Oreodera brailovskvi Chemsak & Noguera, 1993; O. copel McCarty, 2001 and Sphaenothecus picticornis Bates, 1880.

TI  - The community of Diptera (Insecta) colonizing axils of <i>Alocasia macrorrhizos</i> (L.) G. Don (Araceae), with records of <i>Aedes aegypti</i> (L.) and <i>Aedes albopictus</i> (Skuse) in urban areas of Manaus, Amazonas
T2  - BIOTA NEOTROPICA
AB  - Alocasia macrorrhizos (L.) G. Don grows and proliferates in shaded areas in several forest fragments in urban zones. The adult plant has axils that accumulate rain water (phytotelmata) and serve as breeding sites for several families of aquatic insects. The objective of this study was to determine the composition of the entomofauna associated with water accumulations in axils of A. macrorrhizos in urban areas of Manaus, Brazil. Individuals of A. macrorrhizos were sampled in five forest fragments, between April/2005 and March/2007 in urban areas of Manaus, totaling 184 sampling units. A manual suction hose was used for the removal of entomofauna. A total of 1,941 immatures of Diptera were collected representing the following families: Culicidae (96.5%), Chironomidae (2%), Psychodidae (0.7%), Ephydridae (0.7%) and Corethrellidae (0.1%). Five Culicidae species were identified: Wyeomyia melanocephala Dyar & Knab, 1906 (91.7%), Wy. ypsipola Dyar, 1922 (4.3%), Aedes albopictus (Skuse, 1894) (2.3%), Ae. aegypti (Linnaeus, 1762) (1.5%) and Johnbelkinia longipes (Fabricius, 1805) (0.1%). The members of Culicidae were the most abundant, confirming the importance of this group in communities associated with phytotelmata, with a positive relation to the volume of water (p < 0.05). The occurrence of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus in axils of A. macrorrhizos demonstrates the potential of this Araceae as a breeding site of these medically important species. However, the real contribution of this Araceae in the maintenance and dispersion of populations of these two species of mosquitoes throughout the year should be further studied.

Understanding the origin, nature, and geographical distribution of species diversity in this important complex has important implications for vector incrimination, control, and management, and for modelling future responses to climate change, deforestation, and human population expansion. This study attempts to further explore species diversity and evolutionary history in the Albitarsis Complex by undertaking a characterization and phylogenetic analysis of the mitogenome of all 10 putative taxa in the Albitarsis Complex.
   Methods: Mitogenome assembly and annotation allowed for feature comparison among Albitarsis Complex and Anopheles species. Selection analysis was conducted across all 13 protein-coding genes. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference methods were used to construct gene and species trees, respectively. Bayesian methods were also used to jointly estimate species delimitation and species trees.
   Results: Gene composition and order were conserved across species within the complex. Unique signatures of positive selection were detected in two species-Anopheles janconnae and An. albitarsis G-which may have played a role in the recent and rapid diversification of the complex. The COI gene phylogeny does not fully recover the mitogenome phylogeny, and a multispecies coalescent-based phylogeny shows that considerable uncertainty exists through much of the mitogenome species tree. The origin of divergence in the complex dates to the Pliocene/Pleistocene boundary, and divergence within the distinct northern South American clade is estimated at approximately 1 million years ago. Neither the phylogenetic trees nor the delimitation approach rejected the 10-species hypothesis, although the analyses could not exclude the possibility that four putative species with scant a priori support (An. albitarsis G, An. albitarsis H, An. albitarsis I, and An. albitarsis J), represent population-level, rather than species-level, splits.
   Conclusion: The lack of resolution in much of the species tree and the limitations of the delimitation analysis warrant future studies on the complex using genome-wide data and the inclusion of additional specimens, particularly from two putative species, An. albitarsis I and An. albitarsis J.

TI  - Topoisomerase 1B as a Target Against Leishmaniasis
T2  - MINI-REVIEWS IN MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY
AB  - Leishmaniasis affects more than 12 million people in 98 countries, the infection being caused by more than 20 species of protozoan parasites belonging to the genus Leishmania and spread by sandflies bite. Poor sanitary conditions, malnutrition, deforestation and urbanization increase the risk for leishmaniasis. Leishmaniasis is the only tropical disease treated with non-anti-leishmanial drugs, among which liposomal amphotericin B, a combination of pentavalent antimonials and paromomycin and miltefosine, that are highly toxic, represent the most used ones. Drug resistance is now widespread and the search for new molecular targets is open. Topoisomerase 1B, that controls the topological state of DNA and is essential for the parasites viability, has been detected as a promising target for anti-leishmaniasis therapy. The enzyme presents structural/functional differences with the human counterpart, making it unique among Eukarya. Here we review the structural features of this enzyme and the drugs that can be developed and used for this specific targeting.

TI  - Revealing the Event of Helminthic Infection in Primary School Children (Ethnographic Study in Taramanu Village of West Sumba Regency)
T2  - BULETIN PENELITIAN SISTEM KESEHATAN
AB  - Helminthic disease including one of the most neglected tropical diseases present in Indonesia, can attack all ages but are more common in school aged children and primary school age. In 2014 the Central Bureau of Statistics data in West Sumba regency recorded 932 cases of worms, and the case is one of infectious diseases caused by parasites. This paper aims to reveal the incidence of worms infection in children of primary school in Taramanu Village, West Sumba regency. Collecting data in the form of participant observation and direct communication in addition to the faeces collection and examination. The result showed that the belief not to bury the faeces obtained since of the ancestors caused the people of West Sumba, especially Taramanu Village less attention to environmental conditions and personal hygiene. This has an impact on the behavior of taramanu community, especially children defecate in any place (shrubs, forests or behind the house) and the habit of not using footwear for daily activities causes the worm life cycle perfectly, and reinforced with the results of laboratory tests, positive infected earthworms, there are even 3 types of worms in 1 child. The real action that can be taken by the community, the government and health workers in reducing the disease of the worm is to break the parasite life cycle that can be done from the individual level is the use of latrine for bowel (jamban) movement and the use of footwear/sandalisasi. In addition, it should be given understanding through the traditional leaders and religious leaders about the use of latrines that the stool is not buried but directly mixed with water.

TI  - Comparative analysis of dengue versus chikungunya outbreaks in Costa Rica
T2  - RICERCHE DI MATEMATICA
AB  - For decades, dengue virus has been a cause of major public health concern in Costa Rica, due to its landscape and climatic conditions that favor the circumstances in which the vector, Aedes aegypti, thrives. The emergence and introduction throughout tropical and subtropical countries of the chikungunya virus, as of 2014, challenged Costa Rican health authorities to provide a correct diagnosis since it is also transmitted by the same vector and infected hosts may share similar symptoms. We study the 2015-2016 dengue and chikungunya outbreaks in Costa Rica while establishing how point estimates of epidemic parameters for both diseases compare to one another. Longitudinal weekly incidence reports of these outbreaks signal likely misdiagnosis of infected individuals: underreporting of chikungunya cases, while overreporting cases of dengue. Our comparative analysis is formulated with a single-outbreak deterministic model that features an undiagnosed class. Additionally, we also used a genetic algorithm in the context of weighted least squares to calculate point estimates of key model parameters and initial conditions, while formally quantifying misdiagnosis.

TI  - Long-term evolution of hepatitis B virus genotype F: Strong association between viral diversification and the prehistoric settlement of Central and South America
T2  - JOURNAL OF VIRAL HEPATITIS
AB  - The genotype F (HBV-F) is an autochthonous Native American strain of the hepatitis B virus. In this study, we reconstruct the HBV-F long-term evolution under a hypothesis of co-divergence with humans in Central and South America, since their entry into the region 14.5-16 thousand years ago. The Bayesian phylogeographic reconstruction supported a virus-host co-expansion; however, two evolutionary scenarios would have been present. Whereas subgenotype F1 spreads along a Pacific coastal route and would have evolved associated with Central American and Andean cultures from the west of the continent, subgenotypes F2-F6 spread along the Atlantic coastline and inner pathways associated with communities inhabiting the tropical forest lowlands. Then, we propose a model for HBV-F evolution in which the selection of differential biological characteristics in these two main groups would be related to their evolution in host populations with different genetic backgrounds and dissimilar demographic conditions.

TI  - SEVERE MALARIA IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA - EPIDEMIOLOGIC RISK-FACTORS
T2  - MEDECINE ET MALADIES INFECTIEUSES
AB  - Malaria is still a major cause of severe illness among people living in many tropical countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. This is a well-known evidence but many different and various factors are involved which account for an important epidemiological diversity. Factors likely to influence the frequence and severity of the disease are analysed : 1- environmental factors : natural biogeography govern the epidemiological patterns of malaria which can be modified by local conditions such as relief, climate changes, natural disasters and, most important, human-related activities Like urbanisation, deforestation, migration of workers or refugees,... 2- host and parasite factors as familial and/or individual susceptibility, strain virulence and level of chemoresistance of malaria parasites and the size of the inoculum of sporozoites; 3- socioeconomic factors such as occupation, educational level and crowding. Moreover the outcome of an infection depend on the level of malaria acquired immunity which is related to the intensity and regularity of transmission.

TI  - Classifying ecosystems with metaproperties from terrestrial laser scanner data
T2  - METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB  - 1. In this study, we introduce metaproperty analysis of terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) data, and demonstrate its application through several ecological classification problems. Metaproperty analysis considers pulse level and spatial metrics derived from the hundreds of thousands to millions of lidar pulses present in a single scan from a typical contemporary instrument. In such large aggregations, properties of the populations of lidar data reflect attributes of the underlying ecological conditions of the ecosystems.
   2. In this study, we provide the Metaproperty Classification Model to employ TLS metaproperty analysis for classification problems in ecology. We applied this to a proof-of-concept study, which classified 88 scans from rooms and forests with 100% accuracy, to serve as a template.
   3. We then applied the Metaproperty Classification Model in earnest, to separate scans from temperate and tropical forests with 97.09% accuracy (N=224), and to classify scans from inland and coastal tropical rainforests with 84.07% accuracy (N=270).
   4. The results demonstrate the potential for metaproperty analysis to identify subtle and important ecosystem conditions, including diseases and anthropogenic disturbances. Metaproperty analysis serves as an augmentation to contemporary object reconstruction applications of TLS in ecology, and can characterize regional heterogeneity.

The type material was collected in fragments of seasonally dry tropical forest in the state of Pernambuco, northeastern Brazil. The new genus and species is morphologically similar to genera Rafaelia Townsend and Malacophagula Bequaert. However, the atypical two thoracic black stripes and phallic morphology give evidence to the proposal of a new genus in Sarcophaginae.

TI  - A systematic review and meta-analysis of the potential non-human animal reservoirs and arthropod vectors of the Mayaro virus
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Improving our understanding of Mayaro virus (MAYV) ecology is critical to guide surveillance and risk assessment. We conducted a PRISMA-adherent systematic review of the published and grey literature to identify potential arthropod vectors and non-human animal reservoirs of MAYV. We searched PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, SciELO and grey-literature sources including PAHO databases and dissertation repositories. Studies were included if they assessed MAYV virological/immunological measured occurrence in field-caught, domestic, or sentinel animals or in field-caught arthropods. We conducted an animal seroprevalence meta-analysis using a random effects model. We compiled granular georeferenced maps of non-human MAYV occurrence and graded the quality of the studies using a customized framework. Overall, 57 studies were eligible out of 1523 screened, published between the years 1961 and 2020. Seventeen studies reported MAYV positivity in wild mammals, birds, or reptiles and five studies reported MAYV positivity in domestic animals. MAYV positivity was reported in 12 orders of wild-caught vertebrates, most frequently in the orders Charadriiformes and Primate. Sixteen studies detected MAYV in wild-caught mosquito genera including Haemagogus, Aedes, Culex, Psorophora, Coquillettidia, and Sabethes. Vertebrate animals or arthropods with MAYV were detected in Brazil, Panama, Peru, French Guiana, Colombia, Trinidad, Venezuela, Argentina, and Paraguay. Among non-human vertebrates, the Primate order had the highest pooled seroprevalence at 13.1% (95% CI: 4.3-25.1%). From the three most studied primate genera we found the highest seroprevalence was in Alouatta (32.2%, 95% CI: 0.0-79.2%), followed by Callithrix (17.8%, 95% CI: 8.6-28.5%), and Cebus/Sapajus (3.7%, 95% CI: 0.0-11.1%). We further found that MAYV occurs in a wide range of vectors beyond Haemagogus spp. The quality of evidence behind these findings was variable and prompts calls for standardization of reporting of arbovirus occurrence. These findings support further risk emergence prediction, guide field surveillance efforts, and prompt further in-vivo studies to better define the ecological drivers of MAYV maintenance and potential for emergence.

TI  - Ecological correlates in Brazilian Amazonian anurans: implications for conservation
T2  - AMPHIBIA-REPTILIA
AB  - The objective of the present study is to identify the ecological characteristics of Amazonian frogs that would make them candidates for endangered species status, and to quantify correlations between body size and geographic distribution. The study included 180 species for which information was available on life history characteristics, including reproductive mode, aquatic larval development, primary larval habitat and adult microhabitat, and activity period. Species with aquatic development were classified in eight ecological groups based on a cluster analysis. Twenty-eight of the aquatic-developing species share a stream-based larval development stage with groups of endangered or vulnerable species from Australia and Central America. The Amazonian species have geographic ranges around five times larger than their Australian and Central American counterparts. The median clutch size and geographic range in aquatic-developing anuran species were 20 percent and 3.3 percent greater, respectively, than those of terrestrial-developing species. For both aquatic- and terrestrial-developing species, body size was positively associated with clutch size. Body size was also correlated with geographic range in aquatic-developing, but not in terrestrial species. Restricted geographic ranges and a lack of populations in protected areas were recorded in both groups. Most of these species occur in the southwestern Brazilian Amazon, which not only has poor coverage of protected areas, but is becoming increasingly threatened by ongoing economic development. The systematic monitoring of the region's anurans and the creation of new conservation units should thus be of the highest priority.

TI  - Toward Developing a Generalizable Pedotransfer Function for Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity Using Transfer Learning and Predictor Selector Algorithm
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
AB  - Pedotransfer functions (PTFs) are being instrumental in saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-s) estimation. Despite various advancements, the performance of existing generic K-s predicting PTFs need augmentation. This study developed a robust K-s predicting PTF using a machine learning (ML) algorithm and exhaustive data set for 324 soils with 28 properties sampled over a tropical savanna region of India. Four ML algorithms were evaluated for this purpose, and random forest (RF) outperformed all others. A substantial improvement to the prediction by RF-based PTF was achieved through predictor selection using a hybrid wrapper-embedded algorithm. The predictor selection algorithm selected eight pertinent predictors (HID-S): S, Si, C, FSF, C-u, GMD, D-60, and D-10. The mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), coefficient of determination (R-2), and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) obtained as average tenfold cross-validation scores for RF algorithm training with HID-S were 0.87, 1.47, 0.94, and 0.94, respectively. The developed PTF (RF-HID-S) was evaluated alongside the recently published PTFs by Araya and Ghezzehei (2019, ), within and outside the study region. In that process, it was observed that the RF-HID-S possessed superior prediction proficiency compared to the recently published and commonly used PTFs in both cases. These findings mark RF-HID-S as the most robust generalizable PTF, which may further be evaluated in different parts of the world. Moreover, looking at the performance of the eight selected predictors within and outside the study region, they can be considered for experiment design globally to make K-s estimation accurate and cost-effective.

TI  - A Tale of Grass and Trees: Characterizing Vegetation Change in Payne's Creek National Park, Belize from 1975 to 2019
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB  - The lowland savannas of Belize are important areas to conserve for their biodiversity. This study takes place in Payne's Creek National Park (PCNP) in the southern coastal plain of Belize. PCNP protects diverse terrestrial and coastal ecosystems, unique physical features, and wildlife. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification technique was used to classify the heterogeneous landscape of PCNP to characterize woody and non-woody conversion in a time-series of remotely sensed data from 1975, 1993, 2011 and 2019. Results indicate that the SVM classifier performs well in this small savanna landscape (average overall accuracy of 91.9%) with input variables of raw Landsat imagery, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), elevation, and soil type. Our change trajectory analysis shows that PCNP is a relatively stable landscape, but with certain areas that are prone to multiple conversions in the time-series. Woody vegetation mostly occurs in areas with variable slopes and riparian zones with increased nutrient availability. This study does not show extensive woody conversion in PCNP, contrary to widespread woody encroachment that is occurring in savannas on other continents. These high-performing SVM classification maps and future studies will be an important resource of information on Central American savanna vegetation dynamics for savanna scientists and land managers that use adaptive management for ecosystem preservation.

TI  - Perception and attitudes of local communities towards vertebrate fauna in the Andes of Colombia: Effects of gender and the urban/rural setting
T2  - ETHNOBIOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - This study aimed to assess the attitudes and perceptions of inhabitants in the Andean region of Colombia towards 17 native terrestrial vertebrate species and the associated sociodemographic factors, such as gender and locality. The data was collected through semi-structured surveys of 100 participants, and five variables were evaluated on a Likert scale measuring people's perceptions (level of liking, medicinal use, detrimental to daily activity, disease transmission, and folklore traditions). The respondents' attitudes were also measured by asking if they agreed that the government should protect or eradicate some species in the region. The perception of liking varied significantly between the town and the countryside for five species (eagle, owl, bat, snake, and lizard), and folklore only varying for the owl between town and countryside. The species with the highest frequency of negative perceptions were native rat, bat, and snake species, which varied according to locality and gender. Conversely, birds like the canary and hummingbird species had predominantly positive perceptions. Owl, snake, and bat species had the greatest diversity of folklore traditions, primarily associated with death and bad luck. Although most respondents supported conserving all species, there was a preference for birds and some mammals and reptiles. The study highlights the importance of understanding people's perceptions of using charismatic species and implementing awareness campaigns on the ecological importance of species less liked by local communities. The results can guide future conservation initiatives to ensure that conservation strategies align with the attitudes and beliefs of local communities.

TI  - Seasonal and Spatial Dynamics of the Primary Vector of <i>Plasmodium knowlesi</i> within a Major Transmission Focus in Sabah, Malaysia
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   The simian malaria parasite Plasmodium knowlesi is emerging as a public health problem in Southeast Asia, particularly in Malaysian Borneo where it now accounts for the greatest burden of malaria cases and deaths. Control is hindered by limited understanding of the ecology of potential vector species.
   Methodology/Principal Findings
   We conducted a one year longitudinal study of P. knowlesi vectors in three sites within an endemic area of Sabah, Malaysia. All mosquitoes were captured using human landing catch. Anopheles mosquitoes were dissected to determine, oocyst, sporozoites and parous rate. Anopheles balabacensis is confirmed as the primary vector of. P. knowlesi (using nested PCR) in Sabah for the first time. Vector densities were significantly higher and more seasonally variable in the village than forest or small scale farming site. However An. balabacensis survival and P. knowlesi infection rates were highest in forest and small scale farm sites. Anopheles balabacensis mostly bites humans outdoors in the early evening between 1800 to 2000hrs.
   Conclusions/Significance
   This study indicates transmission is unlikely to be prevented by bednets. This combined with its high vectorial capacity poses a threat to malaria elimination programmes within the region.

TI  - Deadly dormmate: A case study on <i>Bungarus candidus</i> living among a student dormitory with implications for human safety
T2  - ECOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS AND EVIDENCE
AB  - 1. Snakebite, which was reclassified as a neglected tropical disease by the World Health Organization in 2017, afflicts at least 1.8-2.7 million people worldwide each year. Understanding the habits of medically significant snakes can help us better construct preventative measures which reduce snake-human conflicts and snakebite. 2. As a case study, using radio-telemetry, we monitored a single focal Bungarus candidus individual for 102 days within a suburban landscape (a university dormitory complex) in Nakhon Ratchasima, Thailand. 3. Daily location checks revealed the telemetered snake sheltered within human settlement habitat 75% of the time it was tracked, where we also documented active foraging, a predation event and interactions with humans. 4. Despite being captured and relocated to an adjacent forest on two occasions, the focal animal promptly returned to the dormitories. Translocation as a management tool requires meaningful discussion at the local level and further study, considering the costs and potential limitations for effectiveness. 5. This case study provides brief insight into the ecology and behaviour of one of Asia's most medically significant snake species and highlights challenges current conflict management practices face locally. Our observations appear to lend credibility to preventative measures such as increasing awareness, encouraging the use of flashlights and carefully maintaining buildings so that snakes cannot enter through crevices or plumbing. Snake-human conflict prevention and mitigation techniques require further evaluation to determine the effectiveness of prescribed management methods.

TI  - Production of quality aroid foliage plants using captured rainwater and irrigation runoff as an irrigation source
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE IVTH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON IRRIGATION OF HORTICULTURAL CROPS
CP  - 4th International Symposium on Irrigation of Horticultural Crops
AB  - Containment and reuse of rainwater and irrigation runoff is considered an effective measure to conserve water and reduce nutrient runoff in nursery crop production. Captured water has been used as an irrigation source for producing landscape ornamentals but has rarely been used for greenhouse containerized crops in the US. This study evaluated if quality aroid foliage plants could be produced using captured rainwater and irrigation runoff as an irrigation source. A collection basin captured irrigation runoff from a landscape plant production bed and rainwater from a greenhouse roof. One cultivar each of Anthurium, Aglaonema, Dieffenbachia, Epipremnum, Philodendron, Spathiphyllum, and Syngonium was planted in 15-cm diameter containers filled with Vergo Container Mix A. Potted plants were grown on ebb-and-flow trays fertigated with a nutrient solution made from a water-soluble fertilizer dissolved in the captured water or well water. Plant canopy heights, widths, number of leaves, flower accounts (if any), and plant overall quality were recorded at the end of production. No growth disorders or diseases were related to water sources. Plant overall quality when fertigated with the captured water was either slightly higher than or equal to that of the control plants. This study indicated that captured rainwater and irrigation runoff can be an alternative source for producing quality aroid foliage plants in greenhouse conditions.

TI  - <i>Gmelina arborea</i> "death disease" in fast-growth plantations: Effects of soil and climatic conditions on severity and incidence and its implications for wood quality
T2  - FOREST SYSTEMS
CP  - World Congress on Silvo-Pastoral Systems - Silvo-Pastoral Systems in a Changing World - Functions, Management and People
AB  - Aim of study: Plantations are threatened by an emerging disease called "Gmelina death disease". The objective of this study was measured the incidence and severity of this disease and were correlated with the characteristics of the plantations, micro-and macronutrients in the soil and climatic parameters.
   Area of study: The present study evaluated 16 symptomatic fast-growth plantations of different age in Costa Rica.
   Material and methods: Fungi were identified from xylem of infected trees. Incidence and severity was measured and correlated with the characteristics of the plantations, micro-and macronutrients in the soil and climatic parameters. Root condition and the quality (specify gravity, mechanical and decay resistance and chemical compositions), of the wood of symptomatic and asymptomatic trees were compared.
   Main results: Three fungal species (Chaetomella raphigera, Fusarium solani and Rhizomucor variabilis) were identified from diseased samples. Clay content in the soil profile from 10-20 cm deep explained a significant proportion of the variation in the incidence and severity of the disease, and stand density was related to severity. Although two climatic variables, Holdridge's potential annual evapotranspiration and Thornthwaite's potential evapotranspiration, showed a relationship between the incidence in the trees and symptoms of the disease. Infected wood turned black in symptomatic trees. Specify gravity and mechanical resistance of infected wood decreased, whereas its natural durability was unaffected. Changes were observed in the quantities of Mg, Fe, Ca, K and Zn in infected wood.
   Research highlights: Gmelina plantations established in sites with high stand densities and high contents of clay increase susceptibility to this disease.

TI  - Object-based classification of vegetation and terrain topography in Southwestern Amazonia (Brazil) as a tool for detecting ancient fluvial geomorphic features
T2  - COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES
AB  - Reconstructing the evolution of large tropical fluvial systems over the geological time is challenging, particularly in areas such as the Amazonian lowlands where basic geological and geomorphological data are still scarce relatively to the large dimension of the region. In such areas, remote sensing data are useful for detecting ancient morphological features that may reveal past fluvial dynamics. In this study, we explored object-based image analysis (OBIA) in the Madeira-Purus interfluve, Southwestern Brazilian Amazonia, integrating geospatial data including Landsat satellite multispectral images, the digital elevation model (DEM) acquired during the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), and stream channels digitized from topographic maps. This approach provided the basis to categorize automatically classes with contrasting vegetation and/or topographic characteristics within the dense tropical forest over an extensive and relatively flat forested area. The main goal was to use these classes as a surrogate for the recognition of ancient geomorphic features consisting mainly of paleochannels that may help reconstructing fluvial history in space and time. Landsat optical images with stream vector were appropriate to classify open vegetation areas that grow over paleochannels, but failed to identify these objects when they were located over forested areas. However, the digital elevation model (DEM) derived from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) was successful to detect these objects even in forested areas. Topographic survey undertaken in the field increased the classification reliability by demonstrating true terrain variations along transects measured across the paleochannels. Based on this technique, networks of dendritic paleochannels were mapped and related to ancient tributaries of the Madeira River that had their courses flowing opposite to main modern streams. This denotes a significant change in fluvial dynamics over time, most likely resulting from tectonic tilting. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Characterization of indicator tree species in neotropical environments and implications for geological mapping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Geobotanical remote sensing (GbRS) in the strict sense is an indirect approach to obtain geological information in heavily vegetated areas for mineral prospecting and geological mapping. Using ultra- and hyperspectral technologies, the goals of this research comprise the definition and mapping of Neotropical tree species that are associated with geological facies (here called geo-environments) as well as their spectral discrimination at leaf and crown scales. This work also aims to investigate the possible relationship between leaf and crown spectral and chemical properties. The study was developed at the Mogi-Guacu Ecological Station, in the Cerrado domain, southeastern Brazil. Data from 70 sample units, such as sediment texture and species from inventories, were first analyzed through vectorial quantization using Self-Organizing Maps (SOM). Principal Component Analysis and Spearman's ranked correlation coefficients were used to define geo-environments and target-species, respectively. Biochemical and visible to shortwave infrared (VSWIR) point spectral data (350-2500 nm) were collected from the leaves of the target-species, during both rainy and dry seasons. Spectral data from target-species crowns were obtained from hyperspectral images (530-2.532 nm, ProSpecTIR-VS sensor) with 1 m spatial resolution, and acquired in the beginning of the dry season. These spectra were classified using Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) with two endmembers (EMs). Based on the MESMA results with two EMs, the best dataset per target-species was chosen for pixel-based image unmixing with three EMs (target-species, other vegetation types and shade). From 121 species sampled in the field, two proved to be associated with floodplains (Alluvial Deposits sequence), two with hills and plateaus of the Aquidauna Formation (Carboniferous sedimentary rocks, Parana Basin), and two more with a specific facies of the Aquidauna Formation that has a distinctive presence of coarse and very coarse sand. Five target-species were well discriminated at the leaf scale, reaching 90.0% and 85.0% of global accuracies in the rainy season and in the dry season, respectively. Accurate spectral discrimination appears to be linked to the considerable biochemical variability of their leaves in both seasons. Three species were discriminated at the crown scale, with 70.6% of global accuracy. When eight other landscape scale vegetation classes were included in the analyses, only Qualea grandiflora Mart. produced a satisfactory accuracy (61.1% and 100% of producer and user's accuracies, respectively). The spatial distribution of its fraction in the unmixed image, particularly, matches with the geological facies to which it was associated in the field. Ecological requirements for successfully mapping indicator species include broad and random distribution of the target-species' population, and singular physiological, phenological (and spectral) behavior at the imagery acquisition date. Our study shows that, even in tropical conditions, it is possible to use plant species mapping to support geological delineation, where rock exposures are typically rare.

TI  - Survey for Antibody to Hantaviruses in Tamaulipas, Mexico
T2  - JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE DISEASES
AB  - Wild rodents (n=248) were trapped in two ecologically distinct sites at El Cielo Biosphere Reserve in the state of Tamaulipas, Mexico, during the summer of 2003. Samples from 199 individuals were tested for Hantavirus antibodies by an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Hanatavirus antibodies to recombinant Sin Nombre virus nucleocapsid protein were found in seven rodents (3.5%) of a single species, Peromyscus levipes. Antibody-positive rodents were found only in the Cloud Forest site, which had lower rodent species diversity, than the Tropical Subdecidous Forest site. Although the identity of the virus hi P. levipes remains to he determined, our study provides further evidence that Hantavirus antibody positive individuals are prevalent in the rodent fauma of Mexico, This is the first survey for Hantavirus antibodies in the rodent. fauma of Tamaulipas and the first report of P. levipes as a potential host for a Hantavirus.

TI  - Malaria Research for Tailored Control and Elimination Strategies in the Greater Mekong Subregion
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - The malaria landscape in the Greater Mekong Subregion has experienced drastic changes with the ramp -up of the control efforts, revealing formidable challenges that slowed down the progress toward malaria elimination. Problems such as border malaria and cross-border malaria introduction, multidrug resistance in Plasmodium falciparum, the persistence of Plasmodium vivax, the asymptomatic parasite reservoirs, and insecticide resistance in primary vectors require integrated strategies tailored for individual nations in the region. In recognition of these challenges and the need for research, the Southeast Asian International Center of Excellence for Malaria Research has established a network of researchers and stakeholders and conducted basic and translational research to identify existing and emerging problems and develop new countermeasures. The installation of a comprehensive disease and vector surveillance system at senti-nel sites in border areas with the implementation of passive/active case detection and cross-sectional surveys allowed timely detection and management of malaria cases, provided updated knowledge for effective vector control measures, and facilitated the efficacy studies of antimalarials. Incorporating sensitive molecular diagnosis to expose the significance of asymptomatic parasite reservoirs for sustaining transmission helped establish the necessary evidence to guide tar-geted control to eliminate residual transmission. In addition, this program has developed point-of-care diagnostics to monitor the quality of artemisinin combination therapies, delivering the needed information to the drug regulatory authori-ties to take measures against falsified and substandard antimalarials. To accelerate malaria elimination, this program has actively engaged with stakeholders of all levels, fostered vertical and horizontal collaborations, and enabled the effective dissemination of research findings.

TI  - Diversity of biting midges <i>Culicoides</i> (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae), potential vectors of disease, in different environments in an Amazonian rural settlement, Brazil
T2  - REVISTA DA SOCIEDADE BRASILEIRA DE MEDICINA TROPICAL
AB  - Introduction: The Culicoides transmit a variety of pathogens. Our aim was to survey the Culicoides species occurring in an Amazonian rural settlement, comparing abundance, richness, and diversity in different environments. Methods: Culicoides were captured using CDC light traps. The Shannon-Wiener (H') and Renyi indices were used to compare species diversity and evenness between environments, the equitability (J') index was used to calculate the uniformity of distribution among species, and similarity was estimated using the Jaccard similarity index. A permutational multivariate analysis of variance was applied to assess the influence of environment on species composition. A non-metric dimensional scale was used to represent the diversity profiles of each environment in a multidimensional space. Results: 6.078 Culicoides were captured, representing 84 species (45 valid species/39 morphotypes). H' values showed the following gradient: forest > capoeira > peridomicile > forest edge. The equitability J' was greater in capoeira and forests compared to peridomiciles and the forest edge. The population compositions of each environment differed statistically, but rarefaction estimates indicate that environments of the same type possessed similar levels of richness. Species of medical and veterinary importance were found primarily in peridomiciles: C. paraensis, vector of Oropouche virus; C. insignis and C. pusillus, vectors of Bluetongue virus; C. filariferus, C. flavivenula, C. foxi, and C. ignacioi, found carrying Leishmania DNA. Conclusions: This study indicates that diversity was higher in natural environments than in anthropized environments, while abundance and richness were highest in the most anthropized environment. These findings suggest that strictly wild Culicoides can adapt to anthropized environments.

TI  - Scurvy in a tropical paradise? Evaluating the possibility of infant and adult vitamin C deficiency in the Lapita skeletal sample of Teouma, Vanuatu, Pacific islands
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PALEOPATHOLOGY
AB  - The Neolithic colonisation of the Pacific islands was one of the most challenging migration events inhuman history. The regions east of the Solomon Islands were colonised relatively recently by a people known as the Lapita. The Lapita brought with them a 'transported landscape' of domesticated plants and animals that had to be established upon arrival for the survival of these fledgling communities. Colonisation of these previously uninhabited islands was potentially perilous, and could leave colonisers vulnerable to periods of resource stress. The largest cemetery sample of Lapita people from the site of Teouma in Vanuatu offers a unique opportunity to assess the impact of colonisation on the health of pioneering populations. This paper explores the possibility that Teouma people experienced vitamin C deficiency as one of the consequences of the agricultural subsistence practices during the initial phases of island colonisation. Skeletal lesions in infants and adults indicative of scurvy suggest that initial colonisation phases in the Pacific islands involved precarious times involving deficiencies of key nutrients. Colonisation of the Pacific islands may share similar frameworks and problems as periods of subsistence transition in other parts of the world. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Variable resistance to Quambalaria pitereka in spotted gum reveal opportunities for disease screening
T2  - AUSTRALASIAN PLANT PATHOLOGY
AB  - Quambalaria shoot blight, caused by the fungus Quambalaria pitereka, is a serious disease affecting the development of spotted gum (Corymbia citriodora subsp. citriodora, C. citriodora subsp. variegata, C. henryi and C. maculata) plantations in subtropical and tropical Australia. Incorporation of screening for resistance to Q. pitereka into current breeding programs is essential for the future development of plantations using spotted gum and Corymbia hybrids. The aim of this study was to determine whether there is variability in resistance among and within different species provenances and families of spotted gum to infection by Q. pitereka. A secondary aim was to consider whether the origin of seed source is a significant indicator of resistance to Q. pitereka. Assessments were conducted in trials consisting of spotted gum provenances, families and clones, all at the same site with high levels of disease pressure and with optimum climatic conditions for disease development. While all species and provenances of spotted gum could be infected by Q. pitereka, results showed that there are high levels of variability in resistance between and within species, provenances and families, indicating the potential to select for disease resistance. Provenance was shown to be an unreliable indicator of resistance to Q. pitereka.

TI  - EFFECTS OF TAR SMEARING TREATMENT ON FALCATARIA <i>MOLUCCANA</i> <i>INFECTED</i> BY GALL RUST DISEASE
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL FOREST SCIENCE
AB  - Gall rust disease caused by Uromycladium tepperianum fungus is one of the destructive diseases of Falcataria moluccana in Indonesia. The fungus induces gall formation either on stem, branch or trunk of young and mature trees. Control practice using tar solution for preventing gall reformation on stem, after removal of gall, has been conducted. However the effects of tar in inhibiting gall reformation, especially on the anatomical properties of F. moluccana xylem, are not known. This study aimed to find out the effects of tar treatment on gall reformation and the anatomical properties of F. moluccana xylem after treatment. Three kinds of treatments were applied on the trunk after the gall was removed, namey, one time tar smearing, per 15 days tar smearing and without tar smearing. Observed parameters were number of gall reformation and wood anatomical properties modification. The result indicated that tar treatments reduced gall reformation. Significant modifications on wood anatomical properties occurred in one time tar smearing treatment i.e. wood fibre diameter and ray width. The effects of gall rust on F. moluccana wood were observable through appearance of fungi mycelia in fibre cell, formation of multiseriate ray cells, presence of phenolic-like compound and modification on axial parenchyma cells configuration and narrower vessel element.

TI  - Investigating accuracies of WorldView-2, Sentinel-2, and SPOT-6 in discriminating morphologically similar savanna woody plant species during a dry season
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Accurate assessment of woody species diversity using remote sensing can assist ecologists by providing timely information for ecosystem management. The increasing availability of remotely sensed data necessitates the investigation of accuracies of different sensors in classifying plant species, especially during the dry season when foliage amount is low. WorldView-2, SPOT-6, and Sentinel-2 images were compared in detecting woody species (n = 27) and three coexisting land cover types in a savanna environment during a dry period. Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers were applied to each imagery to make a strong case for the comparison. The overall classification accuracies ranged between 52% and 65% for all images, with the WorldView-2 image performing the best followed by Sentinel-2 and SPOT-6 images. These accuracy rankings were similar for both the RF and SVM classifiers, with the former faring better. Pairwise comparison of the images using McNemar's test showed significant differences between images in their ability to correctly identify woody species. Analysis of band importance revealed better contributions to the classifications of infrared bands for all images. Overall, the findings showed the potential of optical imagery in classifying and monitoring woody species hotspots in savanna environments even during a low photosynthesis season.

T2  - LANCET INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB  - Background The Ebola epidemics in west Africa and the Democratic Republic of the Congo highlight an urgent need for safe and effective vaccines to prevent Ebola virus disease. We aimed to assess the safety and long-tenn immunogenicity of a two-dose heterologous vaccine regimen, comprising the adenovirus type 26 vector-based vaccine encoding the Ebola virus glycoprotein (Ad26.ZEBOV) and the modified vaccinia Ankara vector-based vaccine, encoding glycoproteins from Ebola virus, Sudan virus, and Marburg virus, and the nucleoprotein from the Tai Forest virus (MVA-BN-Filo), in Sierra Leone, a country previously affected by Ebola.
   Methods The trial comprised two stages: an open-label, non-randomised stage 1, and a randomised, double-blind, controlled stage 2. The study was done at three clinics in Kambia district, Sierra Leone. In stage 1, healthy adults (aged >= 18 years) residing in or near Kambia district, received an intramuscular injection of Ad 26.Z EBOV (5 x 10(10) viral particles) on day 1 (first dose) followed by an intramuscular injection of MVA-BN-Filo (1 x 10(8) infectious units) on day 57 (second dose). An Ad 26.Z EBOV booster vaccination was offered at 2 years after the first dose to stage 1 participants. The eligibility criteria for adult participants in stage 2 were consistent with stage 1 eligibility criteria. Stage 2 participants were randomly assigned (3:1), by computer-generated block randomisation (block size of eight) via an interactive web-response system, to receive either the Ebola vaccine regimen (Ad26.ZEBOV followed by MVA-BN-Filo) or an intramuscular injection of a single dose of meningococcal quadrivalent (serogroups A, C, W135, and Y) conjugate vaccine (MenACWY; first dose) followed by placebo on day 57 (second dose; control group). Study team personnel, except those with primary responsibility for study vaccine preparation, and participants were masked to study vaccine allocation. The primary outcome was the safety of the Ad26.ZEBOV and MVA-BN-Filo vaccine regimen, which was assessed in all participants who had received at least one dose of study vaccine. Safety was assessed as solicited local and systemic adverse events occurring in the first 7 days after each vaccination, unsolicited adverse events occurring in the first 28 days after each vaccination, and serious adverse events or immediate reportable events occurring up to each participant's last study visit. Secondary outcomes were to assess Ebola virus glycoprotein-specific binding antibody responses at 21 days after the second vaccine in a perprotocol set of participants (ie, those who had received both vaccinations within the protocol-defined time window, had at least one evaluable post-vaccination sample, and had no major protocol deviations that could have influenced the immune response) and to assess the safety and tolerability of the Ad26.ZEBOV booster vaccination in stage 1 participants who had received the booster dose. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02509494.
   Findings Between Sept 30, 2015, and Oct 19, 2016, 443 participants (43 in stage 1 and 400 in stage 2) were enrolled; 341 participants assigned to receive the Ad26.ZEBOV and MVA-BN-Filo regimen and 102 participants assigned to receive the MenACWY and placebo regimen received at least one dose of study vaccine. Both regimens were well tolerated with no safety concerns. In stage 1, solicited local adverse events (mostly mild or moderate injection-site pain) were reported in 12 (28%) of 43 participants after Ad26.ZEBOV vaccination and in six (14%) participants after MVA-BN-Filo vaccination. In stage 2, solicited local adverse events were reported in 51(17%) of 298 participants after Ad26.ZEBOV vaccination, in 58 (24%) of 246 after MVA-BN-Filo vaccination, in 17 (17%) of 102 after MenACWY vaccination, and in eight (9%) of 86 after placebo injection. In stage 1, solicited systemic adverse events were reported in 18 (42%) of 43 participants after Ad26.ZEBOV vaccination and in 17 (40%) after MVA-BN-Filo vaccination. In stage 2, solicited systemic adverse events were reported in 161 (54%) of 298 participants after Ad26.ZEBOV vaccination, in 107 (43%) of 246 after MVA-BN-Filo vaccination, in 51 (50%) of 102 after MenACWY vaccination, and in 39 (45%) of 86 after placebo injection. Solicited systemic adverse events in both stage 1 and 2 participants included mostly mild or moderate headache, myalgia, fatigue, and arthralgia. The most frequent unsolicited adverse event after the first dose was headache in stage 1 and malaria in stage 2. Malaria was the most frequent unsolicited adverse event after the second dose in both stage 1 and 2. No serious adverse event was considered related to the study vaccine, and no immediate reportable events were observed. In stage 1, the safety profile after the booster vaccination was not notably different to that observed after the first dose. Vaccine-induced humoral immune responses were observed in 41 (98%) of 42 stage 1 participants (geometric mean binding antibody concentration 4784 ELISA units [EU]/mL [95% CI 3736-6125J) and in 176 (98%) of 179 stage 2 participants (3810 EU/mL [3312-43831) at 21 days after the second vaccination.
   Interpretation The Ad26.ZEBOV and MVA-BN-Filo vaccine regimen was well tolerated and immunogenic, with persistent humoral immune responses. These data support the use of this vaccine regimen for Ebola virus disease prophylaxis in adults. Copyright (C) 2021. Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Echinococcus Granulosus Infection in Two Free-Ranging Lumholtz's Tree-Kangaroo (<i>Dendrolagus lumholtzi</i>) from the Atherton Tablelands, Queensland
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE
AB  - Infection with the larval stage of the cestode, Echinococcus granulosus sensu lato (s.l.), causes hydatid disease (hydatidosis) in a range of hosts, including macropods and other marsupials, cattle, and humans. Wild macropods are an important sylvatic reservoir for the life cycle of E. granulosus (s.l.) in Australia, and so provide a conduit for transmission of hydatid disease to domestic animals and humans. Two Lumholtz's tree-kangaroos (Dendrolagus lumholtzi) from the Atherton Tablelands of Far North Queensland were recently found to have hydatid cysts in both liver and lung tissues. Tree-kangaroos may travel across the ground between patches of forest but are primarily arboreal leaf-eating macropods. The finding of hydatid cysts in an arboreal folivore may indicate that the area has a high level of contamination with eggs of E. granulosus (s.l.). This finding may be of significance to human health as well as indicating the need for further investigation into the prevalence of hydatid disease in domestic stock, wildlife and humans living in this rapidly urbanizing region.

TI  - Conservation of aquatic insects in Neotropical regions: A gap analysis using potential distributions of diving beetles in Cuba
T2  - AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS
AB  - Human activities are an increasing threat to Neotropical freshwater ecosystems, with the potential extinction of thousands of aquatic species. Despite this, knowledge about the effectiveness of protected area networks in protecting aquatic insects in this biogeographical region is very limited. Cuba supports the highest diversity of aquatic insects in the Antilles, with a large number of endemics. A gap analysis was conducted to assess the effectiveness of the National System of Protected Areas of Cuba (NSPAC) in the conservation of Cuban diving beetles (family Dytiscidae). This involved considering the areas with the highest potential species richness, estimated by using species distribution models with three different approaches (MaxEnt, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine), and the known localities of endemic species. The highest potential species richness of Dytiscidae in Cuba is predicted to occur in the low-medium altitude of the eastern mountain areas. Although most of these areas occur inside the NSPAC, several areas of potential high species richness are currently unprotected. It is recommended that sampling programmes are carried out in areas with high predicted species richness to validate the species distribution models. The distribution of three Cuban endemic species (Copelatus barbouri, Desmopachria glabella and Celina cubensis) lies completely outside of the NSPAC. Despite their conservation interest as threatened endemic species, they are currently unprotected. To improve the conservation of freshwater biodiversity in Cuba it is recommended that (i) the NSPAC network is extended to protect areas supporting endemic species and those with the highest potential species richness that are currently unprotected, and (ii) a whole-catchment management approach, specifically to maintain natural flows, should be adopted, especially in the mountainous areas of eastern Cuba.

TI  - Progress towards onchocerciasis elimination in Cote d'Ivoire: A geospatial modelling study
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Author summary
   Cote d'Ivoire is endemic for onchocerciasis (also known as "river blindness"). This neglected tropical disease is transmitted by biting black flies that breed in fast flowing rivers. From 1975 to 1991, onchocerciasis control was based on weekly aerial spraying of the insecticide temephos, on black fly breeding sites. Vector control, however, was mostly focused on the northern and central parts of the country. From 1992 to present, mass treatment with ivermectin was implemented in all endemic areas, including forested regions in the south. Here we present the first geospatial estimates of onchocerciasis endemicity over time. Using the machine learning algorithm quantile regression forest, we implemented models to: identify important socio-demographic and environmental factors that correlate with onchocerciasis infection; predict the prevalence and density of infection in areas without ground-truth data; delineate remaining infection hotspots. Our results show that Cote d'Ivoire has made very significant progress in reducing infection parameters over time, and they may help to inform future interventions to achieve the goal of onchocerciasis elimination in Cote d'Ivoire.
   Background
   Cote d'Ivoire has had 45 years of intervention for onchocerciasis by vector control (from 1975 to 1991), ivermectin mass drug administration (MDA) (from 1992 to 1994) and community directed treatment with ivermectin (CDTi) from 1995 to the present. We modeled onchocerciasis endemicity during two time periods that correspond to the scale up of vector control and ivermectin distribution, respectively. This analysis illustrates progress towards elimination during these periods, and it has identified potential hotspots areas that are at risk for ongoing transmission.
   Methods and findings
   The analysis used Ministry of Health skin snip microfilaria (MF) prevalence and intensity data collected between 1975 and 2016. Socio-demographic and environmental factors were incorporated into a predictive, machine learning algorithm to create continuous maps of onchocerciasis endemicity. Overall predicted mean MF prevalence decreased from 51.8% circa 1991 to 3.9% circa 2016. The model predicted infection foci with higher prevalence in the southern region of the country. Predicted mean community MF load (CMFL) decreased from 10.1MF/snip circa 1991 to 0.1MF/snip circa 2016. Again, the model predicts foci with higher Mf densities in the southern region. For assessing model performance, the root mean squared error and R-2 values were 1.14 and 0.62 respectively for a model trained with data collected prior to 1991, and 1.28 and 0.57 for the model trained with infection survey data collected later, after the introduction of ivermectin. Finally, our models show that proximity to permanent inland bodies of water and altitude were the most informative variables that correlated with onchocerciasis endemicity.
   Conclusion/Significance
   This study further documents the significant reduction of onchocerciasis infection following widespread use of ivermectin for onchocerciasis control in Cote d'Ivoire. Maps produced predict areas at risk for ongoing infection and transmission. Onchocerciasis might be eliminated in Cote d'Ivoire in the future with a combination of sustained CDTi with high coverage, active surveillance, and close monitoring for persistent infection in previously hyper-endemic areas.

TI  - Genetic and phenotypic changes accompanying the emergence of epizootic subtype IC Venezuelan equine encephalitis viruses from an enzootic subtype ID progenitor
T2  - JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY
AB  - Recent studies have indicated that epizootic Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) viruses can evolve fi om enzootic subtype ID strains that circulate continuously in lowland tropical forests (A. M. Powers, M. S. Oberste. A. C. Brault, R. Rico-Hesse, S. M. Schmura, J. F. Smith, W. Kang, W. P, Sweeney, and S. C, Weaver, J. Virol, 71:6697-6705, 1997), To identify mutations associated with the phenotypic changes leading to epizootics, we sequenced the entire genomes of two subtype IC epizootic VEE virus strains isolated during a 1992-1993 Venezuelan outbreak and four sympatric, subtype ID enzootic strains closely related to the predicted epizootic progenitor. Analysis by maximum-parsimony phylogenetic methods revealed 25 nucleotide differences which were predicted to have accompanied the 1992 epizootic emergence; 7 of these encoded amino acid changes in the nsP1, nsP3, capsid, and E2 envelope glycoprotein, and 2 were mutations in the 3' untranslated genome region. Comparisons with the genomic sequences of IAB and other IC epizootic VEE virus strains revealed that only one of the seven amino acid changes associated with the 1992 emergence, a threonine-to-methionine change at position 360 of the nsP3 protein, accompanied another VEE virus emergence event. Two changes in the E2 envelope glycoprotein region believed to include the major antigenic determinants, both involving replacement of uncharged residues with arginine, are also candidates for epizootic determinants.

TI  - The diversity of the Chagas parasite, <i>Trypanosoma cruzi</i>, infecting the main Central American vector, <i>Triatoma dimidiata</i>, from Mexico to Colombia
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Little is known about the strains of Trypanosoma cruzi circulating in Central America and specifically in the most important vector in this region, Triatoma dimidiata. Approximately six million people are infected with T. cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, which has the greatest negative economic impact and is responsible for similar to 12,000 deaths annually in Latin America. By international consensus, strains of T. cruzi are divided into six monophyletic clades called discrete typing units (DTUs TcI-VI) and a seventh DTU first identified in bats called TcBat. TcI shows the greatest geographic range and diversity. Identifying strains present and diversity within these strains is important as different strains and their genotypes may cause different pathologies and may circulate in different localities and transmission cycles, thus impacting control efforts, treatment and vaccine development. To determine parasite strains present in T. dimidiata across its geographic range from Mexico to Colombia, we isolated abdominal DNA from T. dimidiata and determined which specimens were infected with T. cruzi by PCR. Strains from infected insects were determined by comparing the sequence of the 18S rDNA and the spliced-leader intergenic region to typed strains in GenBank. Two DTUs were found: 94% of infected T. dimidiata contained TcI and 6% contained TcIV. TcI exhibited high genetic diversity. Geographic structure of TcI haplotypes was evident by Principal Component and Median-Joining Network analyses as well as a significant result in the Mantel test, indicating isolation by distance. There was little evidence of association with TcI haplotypes and host/vector or ecotope. This study provides new information about the strains circulating in the most important Chagas vector in Central America and reveals considerable variability within TcI as well as geographic structuring at this large geographic scale. The lack of association with particular vectors/hosts or ecotopes suggests the parasites are moving among vectors/hosts and ecotopes therefore a comprehensive approach, such as the Ecohealth approach that makes houses refractory to the vectors will be needed to successfully halt transmission of Chagas disease.

TI  - Vegetation loss and the 2016 Oropouche fever outbreak in Peru
T2  - MEMORIAS DO INSTITUTO OSWALDO CRUZ
AB  - BACKGROUND Oropouche virus causes Oropouche fever, an arboviral disease transmitted mainly by midges of the genus Culicoides and Culex mosquitoes. Clinical presentation of Oropouche fever in humans includes fever, headache, rash, myalgia, and in rare cases spontaneous bleeding and aseptic meningitis. Landscape change has been proposed as a driver of Oropouche fever emergence.
   OBJECTIVE To investigate the landscape epidemiology of the Oropouche fever outbreak that began in April 2016 in Cusco, Peru.
   METHODS We used information of vegetation and multivariate spatial analyses including ecological niche modeling. Vegetation was characterised using16-day composite enhanced vegetation index (EVI) images at 500 m spatial resolution from the MODIS sensor carried by the Terra satellite.
   FINDINGS Cases were distributed across seven Peruvian districts in two provinces. La Concepcion was the province with most of the affected districts. EVI time series across 2000 to 2016 suggested a decline in the vegetation in sites with Oropouche fever cases before the epidemic. Our ecological niche modeling suggests that other areas in Junin, Apurimac, and Madre de Dios departments are at risk of Oropouche fever occurrence.
   MAIN CONCLUSIONS Our results may provide a guide for future fieldwork to test hypotheses regarding Oropouche fever emergence and habitat loss in tropical Latin America.

TI  - The acacia plantation boom in Thu'a Thien Hue Province, Central Vietnam: A survey of tree farmers' shifting livelihoods, environmental perceptions, and occupational perspectives
T2  - TREES FORESTS AND PEOPLE
AB  - The rise of exotic-species-based plantation forestry in biodiverse tropical countries transforms livelihoods and environmental qualities in various ways. Through 180 structured interviews of different types of acacia plantation owners (producers of woodchips/sawlogs, with/without membership in a recent Forest Stewardship Council [FSC] program) we investigated such transformations in three districts along a lowland-upland gradient in Thua Thien Hue Province, Central Vietnam. We focused on how trajectories of livelihood and income changes related to the farmers' perceptions on environmental changes, and how this, in turn, was linked to the farmers' assessments of opportunities, risks, and concrete plans in tree cultivations. Sawlog producers (especially with FSC-certification) in the lowlands had been among the first to plant acacias in the 1990s, and in 2018 usually owned large plantations. In contrast, most farmers producing just woodchips were smallholders. Before acacias the farmers' livelihoods were often more diversified in terms of agricultural products. Since then, many farmers (especially in the lowlands) abandoned rice/cassava production and/or livestock keeping to concentrate on wood production, willingly and/or as an outcome of land conversion (enclosure) to privatised plantations. Farmers' incomes and material assets usually increased (especially FSC-farmers), but most smallholders still depended on incomes from subsidiary wage labor. Within a context of 'development' improvements were also seen in infrastructure (buildings, roads, water provisioning) and public services (education, health). Considering acacia planting most farmers (especially FSC-farmers in the lowlands) saw environmental improvements in terms of soil fertility and landscape amenity, but not wildlife habitat. Most farmers also saw plantation value (especially on longer rotations) in terms of natural hazards mitigation (i.e. floods, droughts, soil erosion), but storms were also noted as the main risk to plantations (especially in the uplands). Another emerging risk was posed by plant diseases affecting acacias in the mid-/lowlands. Projective future plans to change plantation areas and/or crop rotations depended on the farmers' economic strengths in terms of plantation land or other capital. Regarding future risks most farmers noted environmental impacts (storms, plant diseases) rather than economic factors (with wood market prices considered stable). Overall, the results suggest an appreciable value of acacia plantations to farmers, however with some marked distinctions between richer (FSC-certified) and poorer (small-holder) farmers as well as farmers in different regions with distinct terrain and land use management histories. We discuss such distinctions whilst also noting relevant study limitations connected to the complex socio-politics of land titling and uses, especially in the uplands.

TI  - Effects of Glycoalkaloids from Solanum lycocarpum on Genomic Instability
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE FARMACOGNOSIA-BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOGNOSY
AB  - Solamargine and solasonine are the main glycoalkaloid metabolites found in fruits of Solanum lycocarpum A. St.-Hil., Solanaceae, a native plant of the Brazilian tropical savanna (Cerrado). In an attempt to develop effective agents derived from medicinal plants for the management of cancer, the present study was designed to evaluate the effects of solamargine and solasonine on cell proliferation and genomic instability. The colony forming assay using V79 cells demonstrated cytotoxicity of solamargine and solasonine concentrations higher than 14.2 mu g/ml and 28.8 mu g/ml, respectively. The glycoalkaloids did not show genotoxic activity at the evaluated concentrations in the comet, chromosomal aberration, or micronucleus assay. The different concentrations of solamargine (1.78, 3.55, and 7.1 mu g/ml) and solasonine (3.6, 7.2, and 14.4 mu g/ml) reduced DNA damage and the frequency of chromosomal aberrations induced by the alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate. The glycoalkaloids were unable to modulate the genotoxicity induced by camptothecin and etoposide, topoisomerase I and II inhibitors, respectively. Further mechanistic studies are necessary to confirm the significance of solamargine and solasonine for health and diseases caused by DNA damage.

AB  - Characterization is given of a new parasite, Leishmania equatorensis sp. n., which was isolated from the viscera of a sloth (Choloepus hoffmanni) and a squirrel (Sciurus granatensis), captured in humid tropical forest on the Pacific Coast of Ecuador. Data based on biological and molecular criteria, as well as numerical zymotaxonomical analysis, indicate that this parasite is a new species of the L. braziliensis complex. L. equatorensis is clearly distinguishable from all other known species within this complex, using the following molecular criteria: reactivity patterns with specific monoclonal antibodies, isoenzyme electrophoresis, and restriction-endonuclease fragment patterns of kinetoplast DNA (k-DNA).

TI  - One Health Approach to Identify Research Needs on <i>Rhipicephalus microplus</i> Ticks in the Americas
T2  - PATHOGENS
AB  - We aim to provide a harmonized view of the factors that affect the survival and promote the spread of R. microplus in the Neotropics, approaching its different facets of biology, ecology, distribution, and control. We review the interactions among environmental niche, landscape fragmentation, vegetal coverage (abiotic traits), and the biotic aspects of its ecology (abundance of domesticated or wild competent hosts), proposing emerging areas of research. We emphasize a holistic view integrating an economically and ecologically sustainable control of infestations and transmitted pathogens by R. microplus in the Neotropics. Examples of research link the trends of climate, the composition of the community of hosts, the landscape features, and a tailored management based on ecological grounds. Our view is that factors driving the spread of R. microplus are complex and deeply interrelated, something that has been seldom considered in control strategies. The effects of climate may affect the dynamics of wildlife or the landscape composition, promoting new patterns of seasonal activity of the tick, or its spread into currently free areas. In this paper we encourage a One Health approach highlighting the main aspects governing the components of the tick's life cycle and its interactions with livestock and wild animals.

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Emergence Pattern of Lyme Disease in Virginia
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - The emergence of infectious diseases over the past several decades has highlighted the need to better understand epidemics and prepare for the spread of diseases into new areas. As these diseases expand their geographic range, cases are recorded at different geographic locations over time, making the analysis and prediction of this expansion complicated. In this study, we analyze spatial patterns of the disease using a statistical smoothing analysis based on areal (census tract level) count data of Lyme disease cases in Virginia from 1998 to 2011. We also use space and space-time scan statistics to reveal the presence of clusters in the spatial and spatiotemporal distribution of Lyme disease. Our results confirm and quantify the continued emergence of Lyme disease to the south and west in states along the eastern coast of the United States. The results also highlight areas where education and surveillance needs are highest.

TI  - Potential of Clusia fluminensis Fruit Extracts to Neutralize Local Effects Caused by the Venom of Bothrops jararaca snake
T2  - REVISTA VIRTUAL DE QUIMICA
AB  - The objective of this study was to produce and evaluate the aqueous extracts of fruits of Clusia fluminensis against some local effects triggered by the venom of the snake Bothrops jararaca. C. fluminensis fruits collected in May and August 2018 and March and June 2019 were used. After fragmentation and drying of the vegetable raw material, it was characterized and the results found were in accordance with the pharmacopoeial specifications. The extracts were prepared by infusion and later lyophilized. The cytotoxic potential of the extracts was previously evaluated by the MTT method (3- (4,5-dimethylthiazol2yl) -2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) in spleen T lymphocyte culture from BALB-C mice. The four samples tested maintained the cell viability of T lymphocytes above 80%, allowing them to be tested against proteolytic, hemolytic, and coagulant activities of B. jararaca venom. The aqueous extracts of the fruits of C. fluminensis were incubated for 30 minutes at 25 degrees C with the venom of B. jararaca and, then, proteolytic, hemolytic and coagulation activities were evaluated. The percentage of inhibition of all samples of extracts tested in the proteolytic and hemolytic activities of the venom of B. jararaca was close to 100%. Besides, the samples of C. fluminensis prevented B. jararaca venom-induced coagulation in the 1:20 ratio (venom:plant), signaling perspective in the treatment of support to sorotherapy.

TI  - Tick fauna from two locations in the Brazilian savannah
T2  - EXPERIMENTAL AND APPLIED ACAROLOGY
AB  - The Cerrado is Brazil's tropical savannah, which is arguably under greater threat than the Amazon rainforest. The Cerrado Biome of tropical South America covers about 2 million km(2) and is considered a biodiversity hot spot which means that it is especially rich in endemic species and particularly threatened by human activities. The Cerrado is increasingly exposed to agricultural activities which enhance the likelihood of mixing parasites from rural, urban and wildlife areas. Information about ticks from the Cerrado biome is scarce. In this report tick species free-living, on domestic animals and on a few wild animals in two farms in the Cerrado biome (Nova Crixas and Araguapaz municipalities, Goias State, Brazil) are described. Amblyomma cajennense was the first and Amblyomma parvum the second host-seeking tick species found. Only two other tick species were found free-living: one Amblyomma nodosum and three Amblyomma naponense nymphs. Cattle were infested with Boophilus microplus and A. cajennense. Buffalos were infested with B. microplus and A. parvum. Dogs were infested with A. cajennense, Amblyomma ovale, A. parvum and Rhipicephalus sanguineus ticks. Anocentor nitens, B. microplus, A. cajennense, and A. parvum were found on horses. Amblyomma auricularium were found attached to nine-banded armadillos and Amblyomma rotundatum to red-footed tortoise, cururu toads and a rattlesnake. The latter was also infested with an adult A. cajennense. No tick was found on a goat, a tropical rat snake and a yellow armadillo. Among the observations the infestation of several domestic animals with A. parvum seems be the main feature. It suggests that this species might become a pest. However, the life cycle of A. parvum in nature, as well as its disease vectoring capacity, are largely unknown. It would be important to determine if it is a species expanding its geographic range by adaptation to new hosts or if it has been maintained in high numbers at definite locations by specific and still undetermined conditions. A higher prevalence of A. cajennense in most Brazilian biomes, with the exception of rainforests, was already shown before. Thus this species is favored by deforestation and is an important research target as it is the most common vector associated with the Brazilian spotted fever.

TI  - <i>Biatriospora</i> (Ascomycota: Pleosporales) is an ecologically diverse genus including facultative marine fungi and endophytes with biotechnological potential
T2  - PLANT SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTION
AB  - Biatriospora (Ascomycota: Pleosporales, Biatriosporaceae) is a genus with unexplored diversity and poorly known ecology. This work expands the Biatriospora taxonomic and ecological concept by describing four new species found as endophytes of woody plants in temperate forests of the Czech Republic and in tropical regions, including Amazonia. Ribosomal DNA sequences, together with protein-coding genes (RPB2, EF1 alpha), growth rates and morphology, were used for species delimitation and description. Ecological data gathered by this and previous studies and the inclusion of sequences deposited in public databases show that Biatriospora contains species that are endophytes of angiosperms in temperate and tropical regions as well as species that live in marine or estuarine environments. These findings show that this genus is more diverse and has more host associations than has been described previously. The possible adaptations enabling the broad ecological range of these fungi are discussed. Due to the importance that Biatriospora species have in bioprospecting natural products, we suggest that the species introduced here warrant further investigation.

TI  - The miombo woodlands at the cross roads: Potential threats, sustainable livelihoods, policy gaps and challenges
T2  - NATURAL RESOURCES FORUM
AB  - The Miombo, the most extensive tropical woodland formation of Africa directly supports the livelihoods of over 100 million people through the provision of many tree products and ecosystem services essential to both the rural and urban communities. While the destruction of the Miombo has often been blamed on the rural communities dwelling near the forest resources, many urban dwellers depend heavily on the various products derived from the woodlands. This paper highlights the importance of the Miombo in the livelihoods of rural people, the potential threats to this ecosystem and opportunities for its sustainable management. About 70% of energy consumed in southern Africa is in the form of fuelwood or charcoal. The economic importance of the Miombo especially from non-timber forest products (NTFPs) is usually understated due to their perceived non-economic value yet they play an important role in sustaining livelihoods of forest dependent people in the miombo ecoregion. The Miombo also contributes to health services through the use of medicinal plant and products, in some cases, contributing up to 80% to rural health, including helping in coping with effects of HIV/AIDS, malaria and several diseases. The possibility of developing payment for environmental services schemes through public-private partnerships, and community-based sustainable management models are proposed. Through conservation and commercialization of some of the products and services, there is a potential to provide income and improve the livelihood of people involved in the trade along the value chain.

TI  - First report of <i>Lasiodiplodia theobromae</i> and <i>Fusarium proliferatum</i> causing teak die back in Costa Rica
T2  - FOREST PATHOLOGY
AB  - Teak plantation productivity and economic value have risen significantly since 2000; however, teak dieback syndrome in commercial plantations is becoming worse every year. We isolated, characterized and identified the causal agents of teak dieback, based on morphological characteristics in culture and DNA sequencing. The pathogenicity of Lasiodiplodia theobromae and Fusarium proliferatum (separate and together) was confirmed in inoculations of teak elite genotypes, fulfilling Koch's postulates. To our knowledge, this is the first report of L. theobromae and F. proliferatumcausing teak dieback syndrome in Costa Rica.

TI  - THE DYNAMICS OF INSECT-PATHOGEN INTERACTIONS IN STAGE-STRUCTURED POPULATIONS
T2  - AMERICAN NATURALIST
AB  - Few insects are susceptible to pathogens at all stages of their life cycle. The population dynamic consequences of introducing age and stage structure are examined through the use of models of insect-pathogen interactions in which hosts are assumed to contract the disease by ingesting infectious particles in the environment. The models are phrased as delay-differential equations that assume constant demographic parameters within age or stage classes. The first and simplest model assumes that only the adult insect is susceptible to infection, while the second model assumes a juvenile susceptible stage. Two further Variants of the second model are considered: one in which the disease does not have a fixed incubation period and one that assumes that a reservoir for pathogen particles exists in the environment. Both linear and nonlinear transmission processes are examined. The introduction of explicit time delays has little effect on model equilibria but strongly influences dynamics. Multigenerational host-pathogen cycles are predicted by all models, although the parameter space in which they occur is markedly model specific. A type of population dynamics Previously observed in host-parasitoid models, but not in insect-pathogen models, was also found: cycles with a period of one host generation or of a fraction of a host generation. This dynamic behavior arises through the interaction of unequal time delays in the two populations. The absence of a fixed incubation period and the presence of a pathogen reservoir both tend to be stabilizing. The models developed in this article are most applicable to insect-pathogen interactions in tropical or subtropical environments, where populations are not synchronized by a severe winter.

TI  - Neuroprotective effect of the methanolic extract of <i>Hibiscus asper</i> leaves in 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rat model of Parkinson's disease
T2  - JOURNAL OF ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY
AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: While the Hibiscus asper Hook.f. (Malvaceae) is a traditional herb largely used in tropical region of the Africa as vegetable, potent sedative, tonic and restorative, anti-inflammatory and antidepressive drug, there is very little scientific data concerning the efficacy of this.
   Materials and methods: The antioxidant and antiapoptotic activities of the methanolic extract of Hibiscus asper leaves (50 and 100 mg/kg) were assessed using superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and catalase (CAT) specific activities, total glutathione (GSH) content, malondialdehyde (MDA) level (lipid peroxidation) and DNA fragmentation assays in male Wistar rats subjected to unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-lesion.
   Results: In 6-OHDA-lesioned rats, methanolic extract of Hibiscus asper leaves showed potent antioxidant and antiapoptotic activities. Chronic administration of the methanolic extract (50 and 100 mg/kg, i.p., daily, for 7 days) significantly increased antioxidant enzyme activities (SOD, GPX and CAT), total GSH content and reduced lipid peroxidation (MDA level) in rat temporal lobe homogenates, suggesting antioxidant activity. Also. DNA cleavage patterns were absent in the 6-OHDA-lesioned rats treated with methanolic extract of Hibiscus asper leaves, suggesting antiapoptotic activity.
   Conclusions: Taken together, our results suggest that the methanolic extract of Hibiscus asper leaves possesses neuroprotective activity against 6-OHDA-induced toxicity through antioxidant and antiapoptotic activities in Parkinson's disease model.

TI  - Prevalence of Mosquito Populations in the Caribbean Region of Colombia with Important Public Health Implications
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE
AB  - Mosquito studies are important for understanding their role in the transmission of pathogens including arboviruses, parasites, and protozoa. This study characterized the prevalence of Culicidae fauna in rural and peri-urban areas with human populations in the Colombian Caribbean region to establish the risk of transmission of mosquito-borne pathogens. From 2016 to 2017, adult mosquitos were collected in Turbaco (Bolivar), Sabanalarga (Atlantico) and Pueblo Bello (Cesar). The collections in rural areas were in the forest fragments using CDC, Shannon, and human bait traps. In peri-urban areas, Prokopack aspirator collections were used inside households. Entomological and ecological indicators were also calculated. A total of 11,566 mosquito specimens, from 13 genera and 63 species, were collected. The forests fragments of Sabanalarga and Turbaco had the highest species abundance and richness. Turbaco had the highest adult Aedes aegypti index. Arbovirus vectors were among the identified species, including Ae. aegypti, Culex quinquefasciatus, Haemagogus janthinomys, Sabethes chloropterus, Aedes angustivittatus, Mansonia titillans, Coquillettidia venezuelensis and the subgenera Culex Melanoconion. Overall, the diversity and abundance of mosquitoes present in these municipalities establish a potential disease transmission risk by these vectors.

TI  - Limited Effect of Ground Floor Fogging on Mosquito Distribution in High-Rise Condominia
T2  - ECOHEALTH
AB  - Fogging with insecticides is one of the main control measures for adult mosquito populations employed in countries that are affected by dengue. In many such countries, urban communities are increasingly characterised by high-density residence in high-rise condominia. Although fogging is typically applied at the ground level, its efficacy in three-dimensional urban environments is poorly understood. Here, we investigated the effect of fogging on vector mosquito distribution and abundance in high-rise condominia by conducting a before-after fogging survey. We showed that although mosquitoes were significantly concentrated at the lower levels in high-rise condominia, they were found throughout the three-dimensional environments. Fogging did not significantly alter this distribution or abundance pattern across any floor level. Thus, any fogging effect was short-lived as mosquito populations recovered within a few days before the subsequent scheduled treatment. In addition, increasing fogging frequency within practicable limits did not prolong the intended control effect. As urban mosquitoes are increasingly insusceptible to fogging due to insecticide resistance and vertical avoidance, this study demonstrates the need to implement other mosquito control strategies for high-rise condominia to manage mosquito populations.

TI  - Diagnostics to support the eradication of yaws-Development of two target product profiles
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   Yaws is targeted for eradication by 2030, using a strategy based on mass drug administration (MDA) with azithromycin. New diagnostics are needed to aid eradication. Serology is currently the mainstay for yaws diagnosis; however, inaccuracies associated with current serological tests makes it difficult to fully assess the need for and impact of eradication campaigns using these tools. Under the recommendation of the WHO Diagnostic Technical Advisory Group (DTAG) for Neglected Tropical Diseases(NTDs), a working group was assembled and tasked with agreeing on priority use cases for developing target product profiles (TPPs) for new diagnostics tools.
   Methodology and principal findings
   The working group convened three times and established two use cases: identifying a single case of yaws and detecting azithromycin resistance. One subgroup assessed the current diagnostic landscape for yaws and a second subgroup determined the test requirements for both use cases. Draft TPPs were sent out for input from stakeholders and experts. Both TPPs considered the following parameters: product use, design, performance, configuration, cost, access and equity. To identify a single case of yaws, the test should be able to detect an analyte which confirms an active infection with at least 95% sensitivity and 99.9% specificity. The high specificity was deemed important to avoid a high false positive rate which could result in unnecessary continuation or initiation of MDA campaigns. If used in settings where the number of suspected cases is low, further testing could be considered to compensate for imperfect sensitivity and to improve specificity. The test to detect azithromycin resistance should be able to detect known genetic resistance mutations with a minimum sensitivity and specificity of 95%, with the caveat that all patients with suspected treatment failure should be treated as having resistant yaws and offered alternative treatment.
   Conclusions
   The TPPs developed will provide test developers with guidance to ensure that novel diagnostic tests meet identified public health needs.

TI  - Predictive modeling of total Hg background concentration in soils of the Amazon Rainforest biome with support of proximal sensors and auxiliary variables
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES
AB  - Mercury (Hg) is a very well-recognized potential pollutant worldwide, and in the Amazon biome illegal artisanal gold mining practices tend to maximize this environmental problem. Considering the large extent of this biome and the evidences of Hg contamination, the main objective of this work was to predict the total Hg background concentration in Amazon soils using proximal sensors with aid of Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms, taking the total Hg content by direct analyzer as a reference. Soil texture, fertility properties and terrain attributes (elevation and slope) were considered as auxiliary variables in the modeling process. For that, nine contrasting sites of the Amazon rainforest biome were selected. In each site, eight locations (30 m apart) were carefully selected to collect composite soil samples at three depths: 0-20 cm, 20-40 cm, and 40-60 cm, totaling 216 soil samples. The pXRF data were separated into calibration (70%) and validation (30%) datasets for validation purposes. Total Hg in the studied soils ranged from 21.5 to 208 & mu;g kg-1. RF models had better performance than SVM ones in Hg content prediction, showing the highest R2 and lowest RMSE values. Clay fraction content, total Al2O3, low degree of crystallinity Al forms, and stable elements (Nb, Zr, and Ti) positively correlated with total Hg. The combination of pXRF + magnetic susceptibility + soil texture data provided the best prediction models, however, pXRF data alone successfully predicted total Hg with R2 of 0.83. Saving time and cost and non-generating chemical effluents in prediction of total Hg background concentration in Amazon soils may be performed, constituting a secure basis for environmental regulation.

TI  - Seasonal coral-algae interactions drive White Mat Syndrome coral disease outbreaks
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Ocean warming drives not only the increase of known coral disease prevalence but facilitates the emergence of new undescribed ones too. As climate change is restructuring coral ecosystems, novel biological interactions could lead to an increase in coral disease in both tropical and marginal coral communities. White Mat Syndrome (WMS) represents one such emerging coral disease, with outbreaks associated with high algal interactions and seasonal summer temperatures. However, the mechanisms behind its pathogenesis, modes of transmission and causative pathogens remain to be identified. Ex situ infection experiments pairing the coral Porites heronensis together with local potential contributory factors show that the macroalga Gelidium elegans hosts and proliferates the WMS microbial mat. This pathogenic consortium then infects adjacent corals, leading to their mortality. WMS was also observed to transmit following the fragmentation of the microbial mat, which was able to infect healthy corals. Sulfur-cycling bacteria (i.e., Beggiatoa, Desulfobacter sp., Arcobacteraceae species) and the free -living spirochete Oceanospirochaeta sediminicola were found consistently in both WMS and G. elegans consortia, suggesting they are putative pathogens of WMS. The predicted functional roles of these pathogenic consortia showed degradative processes, hinting that tissue lyses could drive mat formation and spread. Coral-algae in-teractions will rise due to ongoing ocean warming and coral ecosystem degradation, likely promoting the virulence and prevalence of algal-driven coral diseases.

T2  - TROPICAL VETERINARY MEDICINE: MOLECULAR EPIDEMIOLOGY, HEMOPARASITES AND THEIR VECTORS, AND GENERAL TOPICS
CP  - 4th Biennial Meeting of the Society-for-Tropical-Veterinary-Medicine
AB  - A prospective study was conducted to assess the dynamics of the infection and host response to Anaplasma marginale in one closed herd in the dry tropical forest of Costa Rica. The study subjects were the darns and their calves born during 1 breeding season (1995-1996). All cows were sampled at 3 month intervals for antibody detection using a competitive ELISA (cELISA) and for antigen detection using PCR/nonradioactive probe assay. All 24 calves born during the study were individually identified at birth and subsequently sampled each month for PCR and cELISA. Ticks were identified from all animals throughout the entire study period. The results from this study confirmed that the cELISA is a reliable assay for identifying new and carrier infections and that carrier infections can exist at levels below that detectable by PCR. In addition, it was demonstrated that calves born in this region will most likely be exposed to Anaplasma within the first 6 months of age.

TI  - Hypo-endemic onchocerciasis hotspots: defining areas of high risk through micro-mapping and environmental delineation
T2  - INFECTIOUS DISEASES OF POVERTY
AB  - Background: Onchocerciasis (river blindness) caused by the parasite Onchocercavolvulus and transmitted by riverine Simulium spp. (Black flies) is targeted for elimination in Africa. This is a significant change in strategy from the 'control' of meso- and hyper-endemic areas through mass drug administration (MDA) with Mectizan (R) (ivermectin), to the 'elimination' in all endemic areas where a range of interventions may be required. The most significant challenges of elimination in low transmission or hypo-endemic areas are two-fold. First, there are vast remote areas where the focality of low transmission is relatively undefined. Second, the treatment with ivermectin increases the risk of serious adverse events (SAEs) in individuals with high parasitaemias of Loa loa, a filarial parasite widespread in Central and West Africa, which causes Tropical eye worm and transmitted by Chrysops spp. (Deer flies).
   Discussion: We therefore propose novel mapping approaches using remote sensing satellite and modelled environmental data to be used in combination with rapid field surveys to help resolve the problems of targeting the expansion of onchocerciasis elimination activities in L. loa co-endemic areas. First, we demonstrate that micro-stratification overlap mapping (MOM) of available onchocerciasis and loiasis prevalence maps can be used to identify 12 key high risk areas, where low O. volvulusand high L. loa transmission overlap, which we define as "hypo-endemic hotspots". Second we show that integrated micro-mapping of prevalence data, and the use of environmental data to delineate riverine and forest risk factors associated with Simulium spp. and Chrysops spp. vector habitats can further help to define target intervention areas i.e. secondary hotspots within hotspots, to help avoid the risk of SAEs.
   Summary: These mapping examples demonstrate the value of bringing prevalence, entomological and ecological information together to develop maps for planned implementation and targeted strategies. This is critical as better mapping may the reduce costs and lower the L. loa associated risks, especially if there are extensive areas of low endemicity that may require treatment with ivermectin or alternative strategies. Novel cost-effective approaches are necessary if elimination of O. volvulus transmission in Africa is to be achieved in an efficient and safe way by the goal of 2025.

TI  - Cutaneous Leishmaniasis and Sand Fly Fluctuations Are Associated with El Nino in Panama
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background: Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (CL) is a neglected tropical vector-borne disease. Sand fly vectors (SF) and Leishmania spp parasites are sensitive to changes in weather conditions, rendering disease transmission susceptible to changes in local and global scale climatic patterns. Nevertheless, it is unclear how SF abundance is impacted by El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and how these changes might relate to changes in CL transmission.
   Methodology and Findings: We studied association patterns between monthly time series, from January 2000 to December 2010, of: CL cases, rainfall and temperature from Panama, and an ENSO index. We employed autoregressive models and cross wavelet coherence, to quantify the seasonal and interannual impact of local climate and ENSO on CL dynamics. We employed Poisson Rate Generalized Linear Mixed Models to study SF abundance patterns across ENSO phases, seasons and eco-epidemiological settings, employing records from 640 night-trap sampling collections spanning 2000-2011. We found that ENSO, rainfall and temperature were associated with CL cycles at interannual scales, while seasonal patterns were mainly associated with rainfall and temperature. Sand fly (SF) vector abundance, on average, decreased during the hot and cold ENSO phases, when compared with the normal ENSO phase, yet variability in vector abundance was largest during the cold ENSO phase. Our results showed a three month lagged association between SF vector abundance and CL cases.
   Conclusion: Association patterns of CL with ENSO and local climatic factors in Panama indicate that interannual CL cycles might be driven by ENSO, while the CL seasonality was mainly associated with temperature and rainfall variability. CL cases and SF abundance were associated in a fashion suggesting that sudden extraordinary changes in vector abundance might increase the potential for CL epidemic outbreaks, given that CL epidemics occur during the cold ENSO phase, a time when SF abundance shows its highest fluctuations.

TI  - Mountain Farming Systems' Exposure and Sensitivity to Climate Change and Variability: Agroforestry and Conventional Agriculture Systems Compared in Ecuador's Indigenous Territory of Kayambi People
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Smallholder farming is considered one of the most vulnerable sectors to the impacts of climate change, variability, and extremes, especially in the developing world. This high vulnerability is due to the socioeconomic limitations and high environmental sensitivity which affect the biophysical and socioeconomic components of their farming systems. Therefore, systems' functionality and farmers' livelihoods will also be affected, with significant implications for global food security, land-use/land-cover change processes and agrobiodiversity conservation. Thus, less vulnerable and more resilient smallholder farming systems constitute an important requisite for sustainable land management and to safeguard the livelihoods of millions of rural and urban households. This study compares a comprehensive socioeconomic and environmental dataset collected in 2015-2016 based on household interviews of 30 farmers of highland agroforestry systems and 30 farmers of conventional agriculture systems, to determine which system provides better opportunities to reduce exposure and sensitivity. A modified Climate Change Questionnaire Version 2 of the World Overview of Conservation Approaches and Technologies (WOCAT) was applied to collect the data. The interview data are based on the perceptions of Kayambi indigenous farmers about the levels of exposure and sensitivity of their farming systems during the last decade. Descriptive statistics were applied to analyze the data from the 60 farms. Results indicate that both agroforesters and conventional farmers clearly perceived increases in temperature and reductions in precipitation for the last decade, and expected this trend to continue in the next decade. Furthermore, conventional farmers perceived greater exposure to droughts (20%), solar radiation (43%), and pests, weeds and disease outbreaks (40%) than agroforesters. Additionally, results emphasize the better ability of agroforestry systems to reduce exposure and sensitivity to climate change and variability. These findings support the well-known assumptions about the key role played by agroforestry systems for climate change adaptation and mitigation, especially in developing countries.

TI  - A new species of <i>Elpidium</i> (Crustacea, Ostracoda) from bromeliads in Cusuco National Park, Honduras
T2  - ZOOKEYS
AB  - Passively dispersing aquatic invertebrates such as Ostracoda in restricted aquatic habitats such as bromeliads remain an intriguing observation considering the highly specialised dispersal vectors needed for efficient colonisation. Here we describe a new species of Elpidium, E. merendonense sp. n., collected from bromeliads in the cloud forest from Cusuco National Park, Honduras. Elpidium merendonense sp. n. is a small to medium-sized species that can be easily distinguished from its congeners by its unique outgrowth at the posterior end of the left valve, visible especially in females. The species was common all through the park occurring at a wide range of altitudes and in different species of bromeliads. This finding is the first freshwater ostracod species described from Honduras and is in agreement with the prediction that the genus Elpidium contains a large number of species with small geographic distributions. We update the list of described species of Elpidium and present a key to species.

TI  - Estimating aboveground biomass of a mangrove plantation on the Northern coast of Vietnam using machine learning techniques with an integration of ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 and Sentinel-2A data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Aboveground biomass (AGB) of mangrove forest plays a crucial role in global carbon cycle by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating climate change impacts. Monitoring mangrove forests biomass accurately still remains challenging compared to other forest ecosystems. We investigated the usability of machine learning techniques for the estimation of AGB of mangrove plantation at a coastal area of Hai Phong city (Vietnam). The study employed a GIS database and support vector regression (SVR) to build and verify a model of AGB, drawing upon data from a survey in 25 sampling plots and an integration of Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 Phased Array Type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar-2 (ALOS-2 PALSAR-2) dual-polarization horizontal transmitting and horizontal receiving (HH) and horizontal transmitting and vertical receiving (HV) and Sentinel-2A multispectral data. The performance of the model was assessed using root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), coefficient of determination (R-2), and leave-one-out cross-validation. Usability of the SVR model was assessed by comparing with four state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, i.e. radial basis function neural networks, multi-layer perceptron neural networks, Gaussian process, and random forest. The SVR model shows a satisfactory result (R-2 = 0.596, RMSE = 0.187, MAE = 0.123) and outperforms the four machine learning models. The SVR model-estimated AGB ranged between 36.22 and 230.14 Mg ha(-1) (average = 87.67 Mg ha(-1)). We conclude that an integration of ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 and Sentinel-2A data used with SVR model can improve the AGB accuracy estimation of mangrove plantations in tropical areas.

TI  - A Comparative Assessment of Epidemiologically Different Cutaneous Leishmaniasis Outbreaks in Madrid, Spain and Tolima, Colombia: An Estimation of the Reproduction Number via a Mathematical Model
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE
AB  - Leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by the Leishmania parasite and transmitted by the Phlebotominae subfamily of sandflies, which infects humans and other mammals. Clinical manifestations of the disease include cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (MCL) and visceral leishmaniasis (VL) with a majority (more than three-quarters) of worldwide cases being CL. There are a number of risk factors for CL, such as the presence of multiple reservoirs, the movement of individuals, inequality, and social determinants of health. However, studies related to the role of these factors in the dynamics of CL have been limited. In this work, we (i) develop and analyze a vector-borne epidemic model to study the dynamics of CL in two ecologically distinct CL-affected regions-Madrid, Spain and Tolima, Colombia; (ii) derived three different methods for the estimation of model parameters by reducing the dimension of the systems; (iii) estimated reproduction numbers for the 2010 outbreak in Madrid and the 2016 outbreak in Tolima; and (iv) compared the transmission potential of the two economically-different regions and provided different epidemiological metrics that can be derived (and used for evaluating an outbreak), once R-0 is known and additional data are available. On average, Spain has reported only a few hundred CL cases annually, but in the course of the outbreak during 2009-2012, a much higher number of cases than expected were reported and that too in the single city of Madrid. Cases in humans were accompanied by sharp increase in infections among domestic dogs, the natural reservoir of CL. On the other hand, CL has reemerged in Colombia primarily during the last decade, because of the frequent movement of military personnel to domestic regions from forested areas, where they have increased exposure to vectors. In 2016, Tolima saw an unexpectedly high number of cases leading to two successive outbreaks. On comparing, we estimated reproduction number of the Madrid outbreak to be 3.1 (with range of 2.8-3.9), which was much higher than reproduction number estimates of the Tolima first outbreak 1.2 (with range of 1.1-1.3), and the estimate for the second outbreak in Tolima of 1.019 (with range of 1.018-1.021). This suggests that the epidemic outbreak in Madrid was much more severe than the Tolima outbreak, even though Madrid was economically better-off compared to Tolima. It indicates a potential relationship between urban development and increasing health disparities.

TI  - Balancing biodiversity with agriculture: Land sharing mitigates avian malaria prevalence
T2  - CONSERVATION LETTERS
AB  - Debate over balancing agricultural production and biodiversity conservation has generated two opposing strategies: a land sparing approach involving large-scale nature reserves, versus a land sharing approach where agricultural areas support wildlife through fine-scale conservation. As a result of this debate, studies focus almost exclusively on species diversity and food production, while ignoring other critical ecosystem processes such as disease dynamics. Here we quantify how tropical avian malaria in an abundant sedentary bird species responds at fine spatial scales in a land sharing system. We find the proportion and configuration of countryside forest elements within a radius of 400 m, proximity to the nearest river, and habitat type explains malaria prevalence across the region. We simulate land sparing and land sharing land use strategies and model malaria prevalence to find that land sharing mitigates malaria prevalence more effectively. With these analyses, we gain a better understanding of how biodiversity, ecosystem services, agricultural yield, and human well-being intersect in complex ecosystems.

TI  - Hair mercury (signature of fish consumption) and cardiovascular risk in Munduruku and Kayabi Indians of Amazonia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB  - Fish is an important natural resource in the diet of inhabitants of the Amazon rain forest and a marker of its consumption (hair Hg) was used to compare selected cardiovascular risk parameters between tribes of Eastern Amazonia. Three Munduruku (Terra Preta, Kaburua, Cururu) villages and one Kayabi village at the banks of head rivers (Tapajos, Tropas, Kabitutu, Cururu, Curuzinho, Teles Pires) of the Tapajos Basin were studied in relation to fish Hg concentrations, mercury in hair (fish consumption) and erythrocytes, body mass index (height/weight, kg/cm 2), and blood pressure. The mean fish Hg concentrations were higher in predatory (578.6 ng/g) than in nonpredatory species (52.8 ng/g). Overall only 26% of fish Hg concentrations were above 500 ng/g, and only 11% were above 1000 ng/g. There was no systematic trend in fish Hg concentrations from rivers with a history of gold-mining activities. The biomarker of fish consumption (hair Hg) was significantly associated with erythrocyte-Hg (r = 0.5181; P=0.0001) and was significantly higher in Kayabi (12.7 mug/g) than in the Munduruku (3.4 mug/g). Biomarker-assessed fish consumption rate was higher in the Kayabi (110g/day) than in the Munduruku villages (30g/day). Although no significant differences in body mass index (BMI) were observed between tribes, there was a trend of lower increase in blood pressure with age among the higher fish consumers (Kayabi). Summary clinical evaluation did not detect neurologic complaints compatible with Hg intoxication (paraparesis, numbness, tremor, balancing failure), but endemic tropical diseases such as clinical history of malaria showed a high prevalence (55.4%). Fish is an abundant natural resource, important in the Indian diet, that has been historically consumed without perceived problems and can easily be traced through hair Hg. The exposure to freshwater fish monomethyl mercury is less of an issue than endemic infectious diseases such as malaria and lack of basic medical services. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Diversity, phylogeny and evolution of the rapidly evolving genus <i>Psidium</i> L. (Myrtaceae, Myrteae)
T2  - ANNALS OF BOTANY
AB  - Background and Aims Psidium is the fourthth largest genus of Myrtaceae in the Neotropics. Psidium guajava is widely cultivated in the tropics for its edible fruit. It is commercially under threat due to the disease guava decline. Psidium cattleyanum is one of the 100 most invasive organisms in the world. Knowledge of the phylogenetic relationships within Psidium is poor. We aim to provide a review of the biology, morphology and ecology of Psidium, a phylogenetic tree, an infrageneric classification and a list of species. Methods Morphological and geographic data were obtained by studying Psidium in herbaria and in the field between 1988 and 2020. Forty-six herbaria were visited personally. A database of approx. 6000 specimens was constructed, and the literature was reviewed. Thirty species (about a third of the species in the genus) were sampled for molecular phylogenetic inference. Two chloroplast (psbA-trnH and ndhF) and two nuclear (external transcribed spacer and internal transcribed spacer) regions were targeted. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using maximum likelihood (ML; RaxML) and Bayesian inference (BI; MrBayes). Key Results Psidium is a monophyletic genus with four major clades recognized as sections. Section Psidium (ten species), to which P. guajava belongs, is sister to the rest of the genus; it is widespread across the Neotropics. Section Obversifolia (six species; restricted to the Brazilian Atlantic Forest), which includes P. cattleyanum, is sister to the innermost clade composed of sister sections Apertiflora (31 species; widespread but most diverse in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest) + Mitranthes (26 species; widespread in dry forests and probably diverse in the Caribbean). Characters associated with diversification within Psidium are discussed. Conclusions Research on pre-foliation, colleters, leaf anatomy, leaf physiology, staminal development, placentation and germination associated with the anatomy of the opercular plug is desirable. Studies are biased towards sections Psidium and Obversifolia, with other sections poorly known.

TI  - Predictive value of interferon-γ release assays for incident active tuberculosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - LANCET INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB  - Background We aimed to assess whether interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) can predict the development of active tuberculosis and whether the predictive ability of these tests is better than that of the tuberculin skin test (TST).
   Methods Longitudinal studies of the predictive value for active tuberculosis of in-house or commercial IGRAs were identified through searches of PubMed, Embase, Biosis, and Web of Science and complementary manual searches up to June 30,2011. Eligible studies included adults or children, with or without HIV, who were free of active tuberculosis at study baseline. We summarised incidence rates in forest plots and pooled data with random-effects models when appropriate. We calculated incidence rate ratios (IRR) for rates of disease progression in IGRA-positive versus IGRA-negative individuals.
   Findings 15 studies had a combined sample size of 26 680 participants. Incidence of tuberculosis during a median follow-up of 4 years (IQR 2-6), even in IGRA-positive individuals, was 4-48 cases per 1000 person-years. Seven studies with no possibility of incorporation bias and reporting baseline stratification on the basis of IGRA results showed a moderate association between positive results and subsequent tuberculosis (pooled unadjusted IRR 2.10, 95% CI 1.42-3.08). Compared with test-negative results, IGRA-positive and TST-positive results were much the same with regard to the risk of tuberculosis (pooled IRR in the five studies that used both was 2.11 [95% CI 1.29-3.46] for IGRA vs 1.60 [0.94-2.72] for TST at the 10 mm cutoff). However, the proportion of IGRA-positive individuals in seven of 11 studies that assessed both IGRAs and TST was generally lower than TST-positive individuals.
   Interpretation Neither IGRAs nor the TST have high accuracy for the prediction of active tuberculosis, although use of IGRAs in some populations might reduce the number of people considered for preventive treatment. Until more predictive biomarkers are identified, existing tests for latent tuberculosis infection should be chosen on the basis of relative specificity in different populations, logistics, cost, and patients' preferences rather than on predictive ability alone.

TI  - Spatial variation in soil-borne disease dynamics of a temperate tree, <i>Prunus serotina</i>
T2  - ECOLOGY
AB  - Soil-borne pathogens are posited to maintain forest diversity. However, their in situ impact and spatial variation are largely unknown. We examined spatial patterns of pathogenic activity in a deciduous forest using a common garden experiment and also in a natural experiment around replicated trees, and we quantified Pythium (a soil-borne pathogen) density around individual Prunus serotina trees. In both experiments, P. serotina seedling survival was 52-57% greater in plots treated with a metalaxyl-based fungicide specific to oomycetes (i.e., Pythium) than in untreated plots. Disease dynamics were not density dependent, but pathogenic activity and Pythium density were spatially variable. In the common garden and natural experiments, pathogenic activity of soil inoculum varied among trees, while in the natural experiment disease dynamics were also distance dependent and pathogenic activity decreased away from P. serotina trees. Disease and Pythium density were not always related but displayed considerable spatial variation. We found that Pythium density did not vary with distance away from P. serotina trees but did vary among trees. Understanding the spatial complexity of soil-borne pathogens is critical to accurately characterizing their effects on populations and ultimately on forest diversity.

TI  - Bat Distribution Size or Shape as Determinant of Viral Richness in African Bats
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - The rising incidence of emerging infectious diseases (EID) is mostly linked to biodiversity loss, changes in habitat use and increasing habitat fragmentation. Bats are linked to a growing number of EID but few studies have explored the factors of viral richness in bats. These may have implications for role of bats as potential reservoirs. We investigated the determinants of viral richness in 15 species of African bats (8 Pteropodidae and 7 microchiroptera) in Central and West Africa for which we provide new information on virus infection and bat phylogeny. We performed the first comparative analysis testing the correlation of the fragmented geographical distribution (defined as the perimeter to area ratio) with viral richness in bats. Because of their potential effect, sampling effort, host body weight, ecological and behavioural traits such as roosting behaviour, migration and geographical range, were included into the analysis as variables. The results showed that the geographical distribution size, shape and host body weight have significant effects on viral richness in bats. Viral richness was higher in large-bodied bats which had larger and more fragmented distribution areas. Accumulation of viruses may be related to the historical expansion and contraction of bat species distribution range, with potentially strong effects of distribution edges on virus transmission. Two potential explanations may explain these results. A positive distribution edge effect on the abundance or distribution of some bat species could have facilitated host switches. Alternatively, parasitism could play a direct role in shaping the distribution range of hosts through host local extinction by virulent parasites. This study highlights the importance of considering the fragmentation of bat species geographical distribution in order to understand their role in the circulation of viruses in Africa.

TI  - A High Incidence of <i>Pythium</i> and <i>Phytophthora</i> Diseases Related to Record-breaking Rainfall in South Florida
T2  - HORTTECHNOLOGY
AB  - Florida's ornamental plant industry flourishes due to environmental conditions that allow for a 12-month growing season. Florida leads the nation in production of tropical foliage, and Miami-Dade County ranks number one in nursery and landscape production with sales reaching $ 2 billion annually. The well-advertised El Nino pattern made its presence felt this past winter in south Florida with the wettest conditions since record keeping began in 1932. As a result, ornamental nursery growers contended with a higher incidence of root rots, crown rots, and foliar blight diseases, confirmed by samples submitted to the University of Florida's Extension Plant Diagnostic Clinic in Homestead, FL. The present study focused on environmental conditions occurring over the past 4 years and included rainfall, solar radiation, and temperature variables and examined their influence on the incidence of diseases affecting ornamental plants. Results indicated Pythium and Phytophthora species as the primary plant pathogens responsible for these diseases. The drastic increase of diagnostic samples identified as Pythium and Phytophthora can be attributed to the unusually wet weather experienced. These two oomycetes are well known for causing disease under wet conditions and growers should closely monitor weather forecasts and practice preventative disease management accordingly.

TI  - Trigger events: Enviroclimatic coupling of ebola hemorrhagic fever outbreaks
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - We use spatially continuous satellite data as a correlate of precipitation within tropical Africa and show that the majority of documented Ebola hemorrhagic fever outbreaks were closely associated with sharply drier conditions at the end of the rainy season. We propose that these trigger events may enhance transmission of Ebola virus from its cryptic reservoir to humans. These findings suggest specific directions to help understand the sylvatic cycle of the virus and may provide early warning tools to detect possible future outbreaks of this enigmatic disease.

TI  - Adult Sand Fly Species from Diurnal Resting Sites on the Peninsula of Yucatan, Mexico
T2  - SOUTHWESTERN ENTOMOLOGIST
AB  - Sand flies (Diptera: Psychodidae: Phlebotominae) are the main vectors of human leishmaniases worldwide. In the tropical forests of the New World, sand flies use large trees as resting, mating, and blood-feeding aggregation ecotopes. On the Peninsula of Yucatan, localized cutaneous leishmaniasis is endemic, and in recent years, progress has been made to identify the putative vectors. But, nothing is known about the natural resting sites of sand flies. The objective of this study was to use aspiration to collect sand flies in different resting micro-habitats mainly on tree trunks and other natural crevices. Sand flies also were collected using funnel traps in mammal burrows. At resting habitats, we collected 95 adult sand flies of nine species, with Lutzomyia trinidadensis (Newstead 1922) most common. Sixty-eight specimens of eight species were collected in funnel traps, with Lutzomyia deleoni (Fairchild & Hertig 1947) most abundant.

TI  - Serological evidence of Ebola virus exposure in dogs from affected communities in Liberia: A preliminary report
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Filoviruses such as Ebola virus (EBOV) cause outbreaks of viral hemorrhagic fevers for which no FDA-approved vaccines or drugs are available. The 2014-2016 EBOV outbreak in West Africa infected approximately 30,000 people, killing more than 11,000 and affecting thousands more in areas still suffering from the effects of civil wars. Sierra Leone and Liberia reported EBOV cases in every county demonstrating the efficient spread of this highly contagious virus in the well-connected societies of West Africa. In communities, canines are often in contact with people while scavenging for food, which may include sickly bush animals or, as reported from the outbreak, EBOV infected human bodies and excrement. Therefore, dogs may serve as sentinel animals for seroprevalence studies of emerging infectious viruses. Further, due to their proximity to humans, they may have important One Health implications while offering specimens, which may be easier to obtain than human serum samples. Previous reports on detecting EBOV exposure in canines have been limited. Herein we describe a pilot project to detect IgG-responses directed against multiple filovirus and Lassa virus (LASV) antigens in dogs from EBOV affected communities in Liberia. We used a multiplex Luminex-based microsphere immunoassay (MIA) to detect dog IgG binding to recombinant filovirus antigens or LASV glycoprotein (GP) in serum from dogs that were old enough to be present during the EBOV outbreak. We identified 47 (73%) of 64 dog serum samples as potentially exposed to filoviruses and up to 100% of the dogs from some communities were found to have elevated levels of EBOV antigen-binding IgG titers. The multiplex MIA described in this study provides evidence for EBOV IgG antibodies present in dogs potentially exposed to the virus during the 2014-16 outbreak in Liberia. These data support the feasibility of canines as EBOV sentinels and provides evidence that seroprevalence studies in dogs can be conducted using suitable assays even under challenging field conditions. Further studies are warranted to collect data and to define the role canines may play in transmission or detection of emerging infectious diseases.
   Author summary Ebola Virus (EBOV) and its related species cause hemorrhagic fevers for which there are no FDA- approved treatments. The 2014-2016 EBOV outbreak in West Africa infected over 30,000 people, killing more than 11,000. This was the largest outbreak to date and Liberia was the unfortunate epicenter. In Liberia, EBOV cases were reported in every county. While preventative and therapeutic agent developments have received much attention, prophylactic measures involving Liberian communities have seen much less attention. In Liberia, dogs may warrant surveillance as they routinely interact with animals of the forest and people within communities. Despite scavenging the excrements and even bodies of infected individuals during the outbreak, dogs reportedly remained asymptomatic for EBOV. In collaboration with the University of Liberia and the Leon Quist Ledlum Central Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory of Liberia, our team used a multiplex Luminex-based assay to detect dog antibodies (IgG) binding recombinant filovirus antigens or LASV glycoprotein in samples from animals that were present during the EBOV outbreak. We identified several communities in which 100% of dogs showed IgG responses reactive to one or more filovirus antigens. This preliminary report establishes the feasibility of conducting EBOV seroprevalence studies in resource poor outbreak sites in Africa using modern and economical serological assay techniques.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON BIOREMEDIATION, BIOMATERIAL, REVEGETATION, AND CONSERVATION
CP  - International Symposium on Bioremediation, Biomaterial, Revegetation, and Conservation (BIOREV)
AB  - Alstonia sp is one of Indonesia tropical forest plant widely used for various benefits such as wood used for furniture, blackboards, wooden sandals, while barks and leaves used for traditional medicine for various diseases. Phytochemical content is influenced by various factors including species, age, and geographical location. This study aimed to identify phytochemical compounds of Alstonia sp. from various species, namely Alstonia scholaris, Alstonia pneumatophora, and Alstonia angustiloba from Palembang South Sumatera. Phytochemical analyzed flavonoids, tannins, saponins, alkaloids, steroids, and triterpenoids qualitatively. The result showed that all Alstonia sp. contained flavonoid and steroid compounds. Alkaloids and tannins were only detected in Alstonia Scholaris. Saponins were detected in Alstonia scholaris and Alstonia pneumatophora. Phytochemical content in Alstonia indicated that they had potency to be utilized as a source of medicinal plants. Alstonia sp. with the same genus but different species had different phytochemical content.

TI  - Distribution and Potential Indicators of Hospitalized Cases of Neurocysticercosis and Epilepsy in Ecuador from 1996 to 2008
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   Epilepsy is one of the most common signs of Neurocysticercosis (NCC). In this study, spatial and temporal variations in the incidence of hospitalized cases (IHC) of epilepsy and NCC in Ecuadorian municipalities were analyzed. Additionally, potential socio-economic and landscape indicators were evaluated in order to understand in part the macro-epidemiology of the Taenia solium taeniasis/cysticercosis complex.
   Methodology
   Data on the number of hospitalized epilepsy and NCC cases by municipality of residence were obtained from morbidity-hospital systems in Ecuador. SatScan software was used to determine whether variations in the IHC of epilepsy and NCC in space and time. In addition, several socio-economic and landscape variables at municipality level were used to study factors intervening in the macro-epidemiology of these diseases. Negative Binomial regression models through stepwise selection and Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) were used to explain the variations in the IHC of epilepsy and NCC.
   Principal findings
   Different clusters were identified through space and time. Traditional endemic zones for NCC and epilepsy, recognized in other studies were confirmed in our study. However, for both disorders more recent clusters were identified. Among municipalities, an increasing tendency for IHC of epilepsy, and a decreasing tendency for the IHC of NCC were observed over time. In contrast, within municipalities a positive linear relationship between both disorders was found. An increase in the implementation of systems for eliminating excrements would help to reduce the IHC of epilepsy by 1.00% (IC95%; 0.2%-1.8%) and by 5.12% (IC95%; 3.63%-6.59%) for the IHC of NCC. The presence of pig production was related to IHC of NCC.
   Conclusion/Significance
   Both disorders were related to the lack of an efficient system for eliminating excrements. Given the appearance of recent epilepsy clusters, these locations should be studied in depth to discriminate epilepsies due to NCC from epilepsies due to other causes. Field studies are needed to evaluate the true prevalence of cysticercosis in humans and pigs in different zones of the country in order to better implement and manage prevention and/or control campaigns.

TI  - Climate variability affects the impact of parasitic flies on Argentinean forest birds
T2  - JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY
AB  - The genus Philornis (Diptera: Muscidae) comprises Neotropical parasitic flies that parasitize bird nestlings while in their larval stage. The ecology of most species of these parasitic flies is largely unknown. Here, we contribute with data that shed some light on the environmental factors that are associated with variations in parasitism intensity of Philornis torquans, and examine whether increased intensity is followed by greater probability of mortality or reduced nestling growth. Intensive examination of nestlings of the bird community present in a 30 ha area was carried out weekly along two breeding seasons in Santa Fe, Argentina. Some nestlings of the most frequently parasitized bird species were followed twice a week, from hatching to fledging, to assess the impact of the parasites. High average maximum temperature and increased rainfall were significantly positively correlated with mean Philornis intensity. In turn, heavily parasitized nestlings were more likely to die: 10 larvae doubled the chances of mortality, and growth was affected in those that survived. The greater precipitation and warmer weather predicted for some areas of South America pose a potential impact on nestlings via this parasitism, and consequently on the population dynamics of native birds.

TI  - Human-Bat Relationships in Southwestern Nigerian Communities
T2  - ANTHROZOOS
AB  - Bat species and their populations are declining globally due to a variety of anthropogenic activities. Human activities, motivated by negative attitudes toward, perceptions of, and poor knowledge and appreciation of these animals, have a major effect on their conservation. Thus, it is important to improve our understanding of bat-human interactions to help design appropriate bat conservation measures. We investigated human-bat interactions in a sample (n = 423) of people living around the Omo Forest Reserve and the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture in Southwestern Nigeria. People who considered themselves more vulnerable to disease transmission from bats held more negative perceptions of and beliefs about bats. A major finding in this study suggests that respondents' perceived vulnerability to diseases from bats did not correlate with destructive behaviors toward bats. Participants with a low level of education intentionally killed more bats than those with a higher level of education. The majority of the participants did not appreciate the role of bats in ecosystems and had a poor understanding of bats' niche in nature and the resulting benefits for humans. We suggest that positive messages that neutralize superstition and myths and highlight the role of bats in ecosystems are urgently needed. They could lead to behavioral changes that benefit bats.

TI  - WHO and the future of disease control programmes
T2  - LANCET
AB  - Huge increases in funding for international health over the past two decades have led to a proliferation of donors, partnerships, and health organisations. Over the same period, the global burden of non-communicable diseases has increased absolutely and relative to communicable diseases. In this changing landscape, national programmes for the control of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, and neglected tropical diseases must be reinforced and adapted for three reasons: the global burden of these communicable diseases remains enormous, disease control programmes have an integral and supporting role in developing health systems, and the health benefits of these control programmes go beyond the containment of specific infections. WHO's traditional role in promoting communicable disease control programmes must also adapt to new circumstances. Among a multiplicity of actors, WHO's task is to enhance its normative role as convenor, coordinator, monitor, and standard-setter, fostering greater coherence in global health.

TI  - Virucidal and antiviral activities of pomegranate (<i>Punica granatum</i>) extract against the mosquito-borne Mayaro virus
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
AB  - Background: The arthropod-borne Mayaro virus (MAYV) causes "Mayaro fever," a disease of medical significance, primarily affecting individuals in permanent contact with forested areas in tropical South America. Recently, MAYV has attracted attention due to its likely urbanization. There are currently no licensed drugs against most mosquito-transmitted viruses. Punica granatum (pomegranate) fruits cultivated in Brazil have been subjected to phytochemical investigation for the identification and isolation of antiviral compounds. In the present study, we explored the antiviral activity of pomegranate extracts in Vero cells infected with Mayaro virus.
   Methods: The ethanol extract and punicalagin of pomegranate were extracted solely from the shell and purified by chromatographic fractionation, and were chemically identified using spectroscopic techniques. The cytotoxicity of the purified compounds was measured by the dye uptake assay, while their antiviral activity was evaluated by a virus yield inhibition assay.
   Results: Pomegranate ethanol extract (CC50 = 588.9, IC50 = 12.3) and a fraction containing punicalagin as major compound (CC50 = 441.5, IC50 = 28.2) were shown to have antiviral activity (SI 49 and 16, respectively) against Mayaro virus, an alphavirus. Immunofluorescence analysis showed the virucidal effect of pomegranate extract, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed damage in viral particles treated with this extract.
   Conclusions: The P. granatum extract is a promising source of antiviral compounds against the alphavirus MAYV and represents an excellent candidate for future studies with other enveloped RNA viruses.

TI  - Distribution and seasonal fluctuations of <i>Ae</i>. <i>aegypti</i> and <i>Ae</i>. <i>albopictus</i> larval and pupae in residential areas in an urban landscape
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Dengue, a vector-borne disease spread by Aedes mosquitoes, is a global threat. In the absence of an efficacious dengue vaccine, vector control is the key intervention tool in Singapore. A good understanding of vector habitats is essential to formulate operational strategies. We examined the distribution, long-term trend and seasonality of Aedes data collected during regulatory inspections in residences and public areas from 2008 to 2017. We also studied the seasonality of climate factors to understand their influence on the detection of Aedes-positive containers. The most frequently reported Aedes-positive containers were domestic containers, drains, discarded receptacles, ornamental containers, flower pot plates/trays, plants, gully traps, canvas/plastic sheet, bins, ground puddle, inspection chambers and roof tops/gutters. We found more Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus-positive containers per inspection in residences and public areas, respectively. The seasonality of Ae. aegypti-positive containers in residences and public areas coincided with that of mean temperature. However, the seasonality of Ae. albopictus-positive containers lagged by one month compared to that of mean temperature. Our study demonstrates the seasonal fluctuations of Aedes-positive containers in an urban environment. Understanding the distribution and seasonality of Aedes breeding helps to facilitate resource planning and community awareness to moderate dengue transmission.
   Author summary
   Dengue, a vector-borne disease spread by Aedes mosquitoes, is a global threat. In countries where dengue vaccine is not authorized due to safety concerns and is not cost effective, vector control is the key intervention tool. A good understanding of Aedes habitats is essential to facilitate resource planning and community awareness to moderate dengue transmission. In this study, we used larvae surveillance data from Singapore, to examine the distribution, long term trend and seasonality of Aedes habitats in residences and public areas. We also studied the seasonality of climate factors to understand their influence on the Aedes habitats. The most frequently reported Aedes-positive containers were domestic containers, drains, discarded receptacles, ornamental containers, flower pot plates/trays, plants, gully traps, canvas/plastic sheet, bins, ground puddle, inspection chambers and roof tops/gutters. Residences had more Ae. aegypti-positive containers per inspection whereas public areas had more Ae. albopictus-positive containers per inspection. We also found that mean temperature influenced the detection of Aedes habitats. This study demonstrates the seasonal fluctuations of Aedes-positive containers in an urban environment.

TI  - Hemoprotozoa and <i>Anaplasma</i> spp. in rodents and shrews of Bangladesh
T2  - TROPICAL BIOMEDICINE
AB  - Hemoprotozoans are important pathogens of animals and humans, among which some species have zoonotic significance. The prevalence of different hemoprotozoa and Anaplasma spp. in larger mammals have been reported from different regions of the world. But, very few studies have been conducted to estimate the prevalence of hemoprotozoa in rodents and shrews of South-East Asia. The study assessed the prevalence of hemoprotozoa and Ana plasma spp. in rodents and shrews of Bangladesh. Blood samples (n=451) were collected from rodents and shrews between June 2011 and June 2013 and July-December 2015 from 4 land gradients of Bangladesh. Giemsa-stained blood smears revealed that 13% of animals were harboring hemoprotozoa (4.7% Babesia spp., 0.67% Plasmodium. spp.), and Anaplasma spp. (7.5%). The study may serve as a guide for future hemoparasitic research of rodents and shrews.

TI  - Seroprevalence of Rift Valley fever virus in cattle in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
T2  - TROPICAL ANIMAL HEALTH AND PRODUCTION
AB  - This study aimed at assessing the serological and virological status of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) in cattle from four climatically diverse zones of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). A total of 1675 sera samples collected between 2014 and 2015 from cattle without clinical manifestation of RVF infection were tested using competitive and capture enzyme ELISA to detect both IgG and IgM. RT-PCR was used for the detection of nucleic acid of RVFV. Out of the 1675 cattle sera tested, 203 were found to be IgG-positive, giving an overall true seroprevalence of 12.37% (95% CI 10.86-14.05). This seroprevalence varied between the four zones with a seroprevalence of 16.16% (95% CI 12.86-20.12), 14.70% (95% CI 11.72-18.29), 10.82% (95% CI 7.19-14.19), and 7.34% (95% CI 5.13-10.41) recorded in cattle sampled in the mountainous, humid savannah, dry savannah, and forest zones, respectively (p<0.05, (2)=17.26). A higher true seroprevalence of 14.58% (95% CI 9.3-22.13) was found in animals aged 1year compared to 10.43% (95% CI 8.12-13.30) and 13.16% (95% CI 11.19-15.42) in groups aged between 2-3 and >3years, respectively, although the difference was not statistically significant (p>0.05, (2)=2.95). Similarly, no statistically significant difference (p>0.05, (2)=0.04) was found between the sexes of the animals. Among the IgG-positive samples screened for anti-RVFV IgM, only 1.47% (3/203) was IgM-positive. One of the IgM-positive samples was positive by RT-PCR. These findings reveal country-wide distribution of RVF in the DRC for the first time.

TI  - Dissecting the molecular evolution of fluoroquinolone-resistant <i>Shigella sonnei</i>
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB  - Shigella sonnei increasingly dominates the international epidemiological landscape of shigellosis. Treatment options for S. sonnei are dwindling due to resistance to several key antimicrobials, including the fluoroquinolones. Here we analyse nearly 400 S. sonnei whole genome sequences from both endemic and non-endemic regions to delineate the evolutionary history of the recently emergent fluoroquinolone-resistant S. sonnei. We reaffirm that extant resistant organisms belong to a single clonal expansion event. Our results indicate that sequential accumulation of defining mutations (gyrA-S83L, parC-S80I, and gyrA-D87G) led to the emergence of the fluoroquinolone-resistant S. sonnei population around 2007 in South Asia. This clone was then transmitted globally, resulting in establishments in Southeast Asia and Europe. Mutation analysis suggests that the clone became dominant through enhanced adaptation to oxidative stress. Experimental evolution reveals that under fluoroquinolone exposure in vitro, resistant S. sonnei develops further intolerance to the antimicrobial while the susceptible counterpart fails to attain complete resistance.

T2  - TROPICAL PEST MANAGEMENT
AB  - Transmission of okra leaf curl virus by seed or by mechanical inoculation was not demonstrated. Transmission by the whitefly vector Bemisia tabaci, Genn. from okra to okra was successful but not from okra to cassava or N. benthamiana. The disease was more prevalent in the savannah area in the north of Cote d'Ivoire than in the forest area to the south. The spatial distribution of infected plants and the whitefly vector led to gradients downwind from sources of infection.

TI  - Newly emerging viruses - a new threat to mankind?
T2  - ADVANCES IN CELL AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
CP  - 6th Cells Conference 2005
AB  - Within the last 50 years, several viruses have emerged, which were never heard of before. Some of them are extremely dangerous, killing 50-80% of infected people within 2 weeks. The group of new viruses is heterogeneous, it encompasses families of Filo-, Arena-, Hanta-, Retro-, and Coronaviruses. Most of them are brand new to the civilized world. There also exist old-new viruses which are mutants of previously known ones and still others are just migrants supported by global climatic changes.
   Our talk will concentrate oil the following questions: Where are they coming from? What diseases are they causing? How many victims they claim? What are their routes of transmission? Can they conceivably exterminate mankind or at least uproot civilization? Can they serve as weapons in the hands of armies or of terrorists? Is any defense being organized?
   We will see that the new viruses are indeed a real phenomenon. They have newly emerged mainly as a consequence of human greediness, which is destroying tropical forests. Their successful spreading is stimulated by poverty, suffering and ignorance. The future is unpredictable. There are certainly still thousands of other viruses in store, which one day can get loose and attack man. Their virulence and efficiency of transmission can escalate. From time to time, they are likely to cause serious problems, mainly if they strike us unprepared.

TI  - An Introduction to the <i>Callithrix</i> Genus and Overview of Recent Advances in Marmoset Research
T2  - ILAR JOURNAL
AB  - We provide here a current overview of marmoset (Callithrix) evolution, hybridization, species biology, basic/biomedical research, and conservation initiatives. Composed of 2 subgroups, the aurita group (C aurita and C flaviceps) and the jacchus group (C geoffroyi, C jacchus, C kuhlii, and C penicillata), this relatively young primate radiation is endemic to the Brazilian Cerrado, Caatinga, and Atlantic Forest biomes. Significant impacts on Callithrix within these biomes resulting from anthropogenic activity include (1) population declines, particularly for the aurita group; (2) widespread geographic displacement, biological invasions, and range expansions of C jacchus and C penicillata; (3) anthropogenic hybridization; and (4) epizootic Yellow Fever and Zika viral outbreaks. A number of Brazilian legal and conservation initiatives are now in place to protect the threatened aurita group and increase research about them. Due to their small size and rapid life history, marmosets are prized biomedical models. As a result, there are increasingly sophisticated genomic Callithrix resources available and burgeoning marmoset functional, immuno-, and epigenomic research. In both the laboratory and the wild, marmosets have given us insight into cognition, social group dynamics, human disease, and pregnancy. Callithrix jacchus and C penicillata are emerging neotropical primate models for arbovirus disease, including Dengue and Zika. Wild marmoset populations are helping us understand sylvatic transmission and human spillover of Zika and Yellow Fever viruses. All of these factors are positioning marmosets as preeminent models to facilitate understanding of facets of evolution, hybridization, conservation, human disease, and emerging infectious diseases.

TI  - MiR-277/4989 regulate transcriptional landscape during juvenile to adult transition in the parasitic helminth <i>Schistosoma mansoni</i>
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Schistosomes are parasitic helminths that cause schistosomiasis, a disease affecting circa 200 million people, primarily in underprivileged regions of the world. Schistosoma mansoni is the most experimentally tractable schistosome species due to its ease of propagation in the laboratory and the high quality of its genome assembly and annotation. Although there is growing interest in microRNAs (miRNAs) in trematodes, little is known about the role these molecules play in the context of developmental processes. We use the completely unaware "miRNA-blind" bioinformatics tool Sylamer to analyse the 3'-UTRs of transcripts differentially expressed between the juvenile and adult stages. We show that the miR-277/4989 family target sequence is the only one significantly enriched in the transition from juvenile to adult worms. Further, we describe a novel miRNA, sma-miR-4989 showing that its proximal genomic location to sma-miR-277 suggests that they form a miRNA cluster, and we propose hairpin folds for both miRNAs compatible with the miRNA pathway. In addition, we found that expression of sma-miR-277/4989 miRNAs are up-regulated in adults while their predicted targets are characterised by significant down-regulation in paired adult worms but remain largely undisturbed in immature "virgin" females. Finally, we show that sma-miR-4989 is expressed in tegumental cells located proximal to the oesophagus gland and also distributed throughout the male worms' body. Our results indicate that sma-miR-277/4989 might play a dominant role in post-transcriptional regulation during development of juvenile worms and suggest an important role in the sexual development of female schistosomes.

TI  - Spatial distribution of <i>Anopheles gambiae</i> sensu lato larvae in the urban environment of Yaounde, Cameroon
T2  - INFECTIOUS DISEASES OF POVERTY
AB  - Background The rapid and unplanned urbanization of African cities is considered to increase the risk of urban malaria transmission. The present study objective was to assess factors influencing the spatio-temporal distribution of Anopheles gambiae s.l. larvae in the city of Yaounde, Cameroon. Methods All water bodies were checked once every 2 months for the presence of mosquito larvae from March 2017 to May 2018 in 32 districts of Yaounde. Physico-chemical characteristics including the size, depth, turbidity, pH, temperature, conductivity, sulfates, organophosphates, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), conductivity, iron and calcium were recorded and analyzed according to anopheline larvae presence or absence. High resolution satellite images from landsat sentinel Enhanced Thematic Mapper were used for spatial mapping of both field and environmental variables. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify variables closely associated with anopheline larvae distribution. Results A total of 18 696 aquatic habitats were checked and only 2942 sites (15.7%) contained anopheline larvae. A high number of sites with anopheline larvae (>= 69%) presented late instar larvae (L3, L4 and pupae). Anopheline mosquito larvae were sampled from a variety of breeding sites including puddles (51.6%), tire prints (12.9%), wells (11.7%) and drains (11.3%). Bivariate logistic regression analyses associated anopheline larvae presence with the absence of predators, absence of algae, absence of vegetation and depth of less than 1 m. Conductivity, turbidity, organophosphates, H2O2 and temperature were significantly high in breeding sites with anopheline larvae than in breeding sites without these larvae (P < 0.1). Anopheline species collected included An. coluzzii (91.1%) and An. gambiae s.s. (8.9%). GIS mapping indicated a heterogeneous distribution of anopheline breeding habitats in the city of Yaounde. Land cover analysis indicated high variability of the city of Yaounde's landscape. Conclusions The data confirms adaptation of An. gambiae s.l. to the urban domain in the city of Yaounde and calls for urgent actions to improve malaria vector control.

TI  - Gene drives for schistosomiasis transmission control
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Schistosomiasis is one of the most important and widespread neglected tropical diseases (NTD), with over 200 million people infected in more than 70 countries; the disease has nearly 800 million people at risk in endemic areas. Although mass drug administration is a cost-effective approach to reduce occurrence, extent, and severity of the disease, it does not provide protection to subsequent reinfection. Interventions that target the parasites' intermediate snail hosts are a crucial part of the integrated strategy required to move toward disease elimination. The recent revolution in gene drive technology naturally leads to questions about whether gene drives could be used to efficiently spread schistosome resistance traits in a population of snails and whether gene drives have the potential to contribute to reduced disease transmission in the long run. Responsible implementation of gene drives will require solutions to complex challenges spanning multiple disciplines, from biology to policy. This Review Article presents collected perspectives from practitioners of global health, genome engineering, epidemiology, and snail/schistosome biology and outlines strategies for responsible gene drive technology development, impact measurements of gene drives for schistosomiasis control, and gene drive governance. Success in this arena is a function of many factors, including gene-editing specificity and efficiency, the level of resistance conferred by the gene drive, how fast gene drives may spread in a metapopulation over a complex landscape, ecological sustainability, social equity, and, ultimately, the reduction of infection prevalence in humans. With combined efforts from across the broad global health community, gene drives for schistosomiasis control could fortify our defenses against this devastating disease in the future.

TI  - Peruvian medicinal plant sources of new pharmaceuticals (International Cooperative Biodiversity Group-Peru)
T2  - PHARMACEUTICAL BIOLOGY
CP  - 39th Annual Meeting of the American-Society-of-Pharmacognosy
AB  - Indigenous peoples traditionally use a wide range of plants to maintain their health. Western medicine has benefited substantially from anecdotal results of their empirical methodology by selecting candidates for a currently inadequate pharmacopeia to treat large numbers of illnesses. As a result of collaborative agreements established between the Aguaruna people of northern Peru, three research universities, and the G.D. Searle corporate partnership, the ICBG project in Pent initiated research to examine ethnomedicinally-targeted plants based on the Aguaruna pharmacopeia involving a wide ranges of diseases and syndromes. Results of biodirected screening against malaria and allied protozoans, leishmania, and diarrhea, for example, showed significant inhibition of these organisms in vitro based on targeted medicinal plants used by the Aguarunas. Tuberculosis inhibition in vitro was also marked among certain plants that are medicinal, although not specifically targeted to treat tuberculosis. All extracts are being tested in toxicity assays leading to selections for antitumor screening and in cardiovascular, antidiabetic, and antiinflammatory screenings. Those found active are undergoing fractionation and chemical characterization to identify the efficacious compounds. Biodiversity inventories, conservation and sustainable management programs, and training and educational initiatives forming part of the ICBG-Peru project ave summarized.

TI  - Multi-sensor prediction of <i>Eucalyptus</i> stand volume: A support vector approach
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Stem volume is a key attribute of Eucalyptus forest plantations upon which decision-making is based at diverse levels of planning. Quantifying volume through remote sensing can support a proper management of forests. Because of limitations on spaceborne optical and synthetic aperture radar sensors, this study integrated both types of datasets assembled using support vector regression (SVR) to retrieve the stand volume of Eucalyptus plantations. We assessed different combinations of sensors and a minimum number of plots to develop an SVR model. Finally, the best SVR performance was compared with other analytical methods already tested and in the literature: multilinear regression, artificial neural networks (ANN), and random forest (RF). Here, we introduce a test for comparative analysis of the performance of different methods. We found that SVR accurately predicted stem volume of Brazilian fast-growing Eucalyptus forest plantations. Gaussian radial basis was the most suitable kernel function. Integrating the optical and L-band backscatter data increased the predictive accuracy compared to a single sensor model. Combining NIR-band data from ALOS AVNIR-2 and backscatter of L-band horizontal emitted and vertical received (HV) electric fields from ALOS PALSAR produced the most accurate SVR model (with an R-2 of 0.926 and root mean square error of 11.007 m(3)/ha). The number of field plots sufficient for model development with non-redundant explanatory variables was 77. Under this condition, SVR performed similarly to ANN and outperformed the multiple linear regression and random forest methods.

TI  - HEALTH ASSESSMENT OF BLACK-AND-WHITE RUFFED LEMURS (<i>VARECIA VARIEGATA</i>) IN RANOMAFANA NATIONAL PARK, MADAGASCAR
T2  - JOURNAL OF ZOO AND WILDLIFE MEDICINE
AB  - The Anthropocene is a major threat to biodiversity worldwide. Human pressures including climate change and emerging infectious diseases are presenting new challenges to wildlife, requiring vigilance and monitoring of wild populations to ensure their persistence. In order to monitor fluctuations in health, baseline data from long-term studies are required. Clinical laboratory data on 80 black-and-white ruffed lemurs (Varecia variegata), derived from the capture of 98 individuals spanning six field seasons are presented. Serum biochemical profiles showed variation between years that remained within published reference intervals for the species, with the exception of total bilirubin in 2008, and creatine kinase and chloride in 2019. Serum trace minerals and fat-soluble vitamin values also fluctuated between years and are within ranges seen in other lemur species. These results, combined with previously published data on ectoparasite load and population genetic diversity, suggest that the Mangevo ruffed lemur population is healthy and can provide important and valuable baseline data for comparisons moving forward.

TI  - Neutralizing Antibodies from Convalescent Chikungunya Virus Patients Can Cross-Neutralize Mayaro and Una Viruses
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Most alphaviruses are mosquito-borne and can cause severe disease in domesticated animals and humans. The most notable recent outbreak in the Americas was the 2014 chikungunya virus (CHIKV) outbreak affecting millions and producing disease highlighted by rash and arthralgia. Chikungunya virus is a member of the Semliki Forest (SF) serocomplex, and before its arrival in the Americas, two other member of the SF complex, Una (UNAV) and Mayaro (MAYV) viruses, were circulating in Central and South America. This study examined whether antibodies from convalescent CHIKV patients could cross-neutralize UNAV and MAYV. Considerable cross-neutralization of both viruses was observed, suggesting that exposure to CHIKV can produce antibodies that may mitigate infection with UNAV or MAYV. Understanding the impact of CHIKV exposure on population susceptibility to other emerging viruses may help predict outbreaks; moreover, identification of cross-reactive immune responses among alphaviruses may lead to the development of vaccines targeting multiple viruses.

TI  - Bird community effects on avian malaria infections
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - In community assembly processes, interspecific interactions play an important role in shaping community diversity, especially at the local scale. Changes in species richness or abundance can modify local infectious disease dynamics, either reducing or increasing the risk of transmission within the community. This study evaluates the effects of bird community on avian haemosporidians infections in a Neotropical region. Bird samples were collected from areas surrounding three dams, and molecular analysis were performed to identify blood-parasitic haemosporidia infecting the birds. Generalized linear models were used to analyze the relationships between the bird community and the prevalence, number of infections, and richness of avian haemosporidian lineages. Non-significant effects of bird community dominance and richness on the prevalence of avian parasites and the number of infections of Haemoproteus were found. However, there was evidence of an amplification effect. Host dominance was associated with the total number of infections, the number Plasmodium infections and the expected richness of Plasmodium lineages, while the expected richness of Haemoproteus lineages was associated with the richness of bird species. These findings highlight the role of host community dominance and richness in the dynamics of parasite infections, potentially influenced by the availability of competent hosts. This study contributes significantly to our understanding of blood parasite diversity in tropical birds within a relatively understudied region of South America.

TI  - Environmental Risk Factors for the Incidence of American Cutaneous Leishmaniasis in a Sub-Andean Zone of Colombia (Chaparral, Tolima)
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Environmental risk factors for Cutaneous leishmaniasis we re investigated for the largest out break recorded in Colombia. The outbreak began in 2003 in Chaparral, and in the following five years produced 2,313 cases in a population of 56,228. Candidate predictor variables were land use, elevation, and climatic variables such as mean temperature and precipitation. Spatial analysis showed that incidence of cutaneous leishmaniasis was higher in townships with mean temperatures in the middle of the county's range. Incidence was independently associated with higher coverage with forest est or shrubs (2.6% greater for each additional percent coverage, 95% credible interval [CI] = 0.5-4.9%), and lower population density (22% lower for each additional 100 persons/km(2) 95% CI = 7-41%). The extent of forest or shrub coverage did not show major changes over time. These findings confirmed the roles of climate and land use in leishmaniasis transmission. However, environmental variables were not sufficient to explain the spatial variation in incidence.

TI  - The blue dimensions of aquaculture: A global synthesis
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - The rapid development of aquaculture has been considered the blue revolution, which is an approach to increasing global fish production in order to contribute to human nutrition and food security. The use of blue water (i.e., surface and groundwater) in aquaculture also makes a significant contribution to global fish production. However, the blue revolution of aquaculture is associated with a wide range of environmental concerns, including habitat destruction, water pollution, eutrophication, biotic depletion, ecological effects, and disease outbreaks. In addition, blue carbon (i.e., carbon in coastal and marine ecosystems) emissions from mangrove deforestation due to shrimp cultivation are accumulating. To increase fish production for a growing global population, aquaculture must grow sustainably while at the same time its environmental impacts must reduce significantly. There is blue growth potential for increasing seafood production through the expansion of coastal and marine aquaculture, which is essential for sustainable development of the blue economy.

TI  - A RAT MODEL OF HTLV-I INFECTION - DEVELOPMENT OF CHRONIC PROGRESSIVE MYELONEUROPATHY IN SEROPOSITIVE WKAH RATS AND RELATED APOPTOSIS
T2  - ACTA NEUROPATHOLOGICA
AB  - In seropositive HTLV-I carrier rats of the WKAH strain inoculated with 2 x 10(7) MT-2 cells at 3-6 months of age, chronic progressive myeloneuropathy, tentatively designated as HTLV-I-associated myelopathy (HAM) rat disease, occurred when the rats were 19-23 months old. Clinical and pathological findings were basically identical to those of seronegative HAM rats of the same strain neonatally inoculated with MT-2 cells. It appears that a high dose of MT-2 cells (10(8) cells) is more effective for the induction and acceleration of HAM rat disease. Seronegative and seropositive carriers of other strains (F344, ACI, and LEW), WKAH rats inoculated with HUT-78 (a human T cell line without HTLV-I infection), and untreated WKAH rats at comparable ages did not develop HAM rat disease, thereby indicating that development of this disease is caused bq HTLV-I infection and is under strict genetic restriction;of the host strain. Chronological examination of HAM rat disease induced by 10(7) MT-2 inoculation into newborn rats showed that the spinal cord lesion began to develop by 12 months of age. T cells were absent in the affected spinal cord throughout the disease process. There was morphological evidence of apoptotic death of oligodendrocytes in the affected spinal cord. Apoptosis was also confirmed by the specific nick end labeling of the nuclear fragmentation in situ, and the apoptotic oligodendrocytes confined to the demyelinating foci, and the number of apoptotic cells positively correlated with severity of the spinal cord lesion, The collective evidence suggests that: the major pathogenetic pathway of HAM rat disease appears to be closely related to apoptotic death of the oligodendrocytes, directly or indirectly associated with HTLV-I infection.

TI  - Emerging agents for the treatment of Chagas disease: what is in the preclinical and clinical development pipeline?
T2  - EXPERT OPINION ON INVESTIGATIONAL DRUGS
AB  - Introduction Chagas disease treatment relies on the lengthy administration of benznidazole and/or nifurtimox, which have frequent toxicity associated. The disease, caused by the parasiteTrypanosoma cruzi, is mostly diagnosed at its chronic phase when life-threatening symptomatology manifest in approximately 30% of those infected. Considering that both available drugs have variable efficacy by then, and there are over 6 million people infected, there is a pressing need to find safer, more efficacious drugs. Areas covered We provide an updated view of the path to achieve the aforementioned goal. From state-of-the-artin vitroandin vivoassays based on genetically engineered parasites that have allowed high throughput screenings of large chemical collections, to the unfulfilled requirement of having treatment-response biomarkers for the clinical evaluation of drugs. In between, we describe the most promising pre-clinical hits and the landscape of clinical trials with new drugs or new regimens of existing ones. Moreover, the use of monkey models to reduce the pre-clinical to clinical attrition rate is discussed. Expert opinion In addition to the necessary research on new drugs and much awaited biomarkers of treatment efficacy, a key step will be to generalize access to diagnosis and treatment and maximize efforts to impede transmission.

T2  - METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB  - Seed dispersal effectiveness (SDE) is a conceptual framework that aims at quantifying the contribution of seed dispersal vectors to plant fitness. While it is well recognized that diplochorous dispersal systems, characterized by two successive dispersal steps performed by two different vectors (Phase I=primary seed dispersal and Phase II=secondary seed dispersal) which are common in temperate and tropical regions, little attention has been given to distinguishing the relative contribution of one-phase and two-phase dispersal to overall SDE. This conceptual gap probably results from the lack of a clear methodology to include Phase II dispersal into the calculation of SDE and to quantify its relative contribution. We propose a method to evaluate the relative contribution of one-phase and two-phase dispersal to SDE and determine whether two seed dispersers are better than one. To do so, we used the SDE landscape and an extension of the SDE landscape, the Phase II effect landscape, which measures the direction and magnitude of the Phase II dispersal effect on overall SDE. We used simulated and empirical data from a diplochorous dispersal system in the Peruvian Amazon to illustrate this new approach. Our approach provides the relative contribution of one-phase SDE (SDE1) and two-phase SDE (SDE2) to overall SDE and quantifies how much SDE changes with the addition of Phase II dispersal. Considering that the seed dispersal process is context dependent so that Phase II depends on Phase I, we predict the possible range of variation of SDE according to the variation of the probability of Phase II dispersal. In our specific study system composed of two primate species as primary dispersal vectors and different species of dung beetles as secondary dispersal vectors, the relative contribution of SDE1 and SDE2 to overall SDE varied between plant species. We discuss the context dependency of the Phase II dispersal and the potential applications of our approach. This extension to the conceptual framework of SDE enables quantitative evaluation of the effect of Phase II dispersal on plant fitness and can be easily adapted to other biotic and/or abiotic diplochorous dispersal systems.

TI  - Mapping of clinical management resources for snakebites and other animal envenomings in the Brazilian Amazon
T2  - TOXICON-X
AB  - Snakebite envenomings (SBEs) and other envenomings triggered by venomous animals (VAEs) represent a significant disease burden in Brazil, with 29,152 SBEs reported in 2021 alone with nearly half of those occurring in the remote Brazilian Amazon. In 2021, Brazil recorded 240,294 envenomings from snakes, scorpions, spiders, and caterpillars. Therefore, there is an unequal distribution of SBEs with high morbidity and mortality in the Brazilian Amazon. The severity of SBEs increases when patients require more than 6 h to access antivenom treatment, a common issue for the rural and indigenous populations. Understanding currently available resources and practices in Amazon remote areas of Brazil can serve to inform future interventions and guide health care policies. This study aims to develop a resource map of existing healthcare resources for the Brazilian Amazon's clinical management of VAEs with emphasis in SBEs, which will aid future strategic interventions. Data collection included a literature review, secondary data collected by government departments and organizational records, GIS mapping activities, and expert input. Our framework was guided by the three levels of healthcare service ecosystem analysis (macro, meso, and micro). Our resource map lays out a comprehensive overview of antivenom access, the distribution landscape, differences in patient transportation, and barriers to access healthcare that face populations in the Brazilian Amazon.

TI  - Prevalence of rabies and LPM paramyxovirus antibody in non-hematophagous bats captured in the Central Pacific coast of Mexico
T2  - TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - To investigate if non-hematophagous bats play a role in outbreaks of rabies and blue eye disease (LPMV), we studied the seroprevalence against both agents in several species of non-hematophagous bats on the sub-tropical Pacific coast of the state of Colima, Mexico. The survey covered a predominantly agricultural area (disturbed), and an area dominated by semideciduous dry forest (undisturbed). A total of 151 non-hematophagous bats of 16 species were captured from the two areas. Fifty-six (37%) had antirabic antibodies (Ab) while 87 (58%) did not and 8 samples (5%) had to be discarded because of hemolysis. A much lower (P < 0.05) prevalence of antirabic Ab was found in bats caught in disturbed areas (22.7%) compared with those from undisturbed areas (51.9%). The presence of antirabic Ab was not related to sex, genera or feeding habits. The higher prevalence found in bats in the undisturbed area may be the result of more frequent interspecies encounters. Of the 108 sera analyzed for antibodies against LPMV, only one was positive (a male Rhogeessa parvula major, captured in the undisturbed area). This suggests that bats in the surveyed localities do not play a role in the epidemiology of LPMV. (C) 2004 Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Mapping environmental suitability of <i>Haemagogus</i> and <i>Sabethes spp</i>. mosquitoes to understand sylvatic transmission risk of yellow fever virus in Brazil
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Author summaryYellow fever virus (YFV) is an arbovirus transmitted to humans from mosquitoes and can lead to severe disease and death. Recent sporadic outbreaks coupled with low vaccination coverage have highlighted the importance of mosquito surveillance for preventing future outbreaks and potential virus spillover into dense urban areas. Yet, very little is known about the spatial distribution of mosquitoes known to transmit YFV and the factors that contribute to their environmental suitability in Brazil. We compiled an occurrence database of primary and secondary mosquito vectors belonging to Haemagogus and Sabethes species' collected between 1991-2019 and integrated this data with environmental and land-use data to predict their spatial suitability at 1x1km resolution. Using this information, we identified suitable regions for their co-existence. We overlaid this information with human population density and locations of non-human primate host reservoirs to identify areas at risk of transmission and spillover. Our study provides high-resolution mapping tools to assist with mosquito and arbovirus surveillance which is especially useful in low-resource settings.
   BackgroundYellow fever (YF) is an arboviral disease which is endemic to Brazil due to a sylvatic transmission cycle maintained by infected mosquito vectors, non-human primate (NHP) hosts, and humans. Despite the existence of an effective vaccine, recent sporadic YF epidemics have underscored concerns about sylvatic vector surveillance, as very little is known about their spatial distribution. Here, we model and map the environmental suitability of YF's main vectors in Brazil, Haemagogus spp. and Sabethes spp., and use human population and NHP data to identify locations prone to transmission and spillover risk. Methodology/Principal findingsWe compiled a comprehensive set of occurrence records on Hg. janthinomys, Hg. leucocelaenus, and Sabethes spp. from 1991-2019 using primary and secondary data sources. Linking these data with selected environmental and land-cover variables, we adopted a stacked regression ensemble modelling approach (elastic-net regularized GLM, extreme gradient boosted regression trees, and random forest) to predict the environmental suitability of these species across Brazil at a 1x1 km resolution. We show that while suitability for each species varies spatially, high suitability for all species was predicted in the Southeastern region where recent outbreaks have occurred. By integrating data on NHP host reservoirs and human populations, our risk maps further highlight municipalities within the region that are prone to transmission and spillover. Conclusions/SignificanceOur maps of sylvatic vector suitability can help elucidate potential locations of sylvatic reservoirs and be used as a tool to help mitigate risk of future YF outbreaks and assist in vector surveillance. Furthermore, at-risk regions identified from our work could help disease control and elucidate gaps in vaccination coverage and NHP host surveillance.

TI  - The effects of the El Nino Southern Oscillation on skin and skin-related diseases: a message from the International Society of Dermatology Climate Change Task Force
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY
AB  - The El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a complex climate phenomenon occurring in the Pacific Ocean at intervals of 2-7 years. The term refers to fluctuations in ocean temperatures in the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean (El Nino [the warm phase of ENSO] and La Nina [the cool phase of ENSO]) and in atmospheric pressure across the Pacific basin (Southern Oscillation). This weather pattern is attributed with causing climate change in certain parts of the world and is associated with disease outbreaks. The question of how ENSO affects skin and skin-related disease is relatively unanswered. We aimed to review the literature describing the effects of this complex weather pattern on skin. El Nino has been associated with increases in the occurrence of actinic keratosis, tinea, pityriasis versicolor, miliaria, folliculitis, rosacea, dermatitis by Paederus irritans and Paederus sabaeus, and certain vector-borne and waterborne diseases, such as dengue fever, leishmaniasis, Chagas' disease, Barmah Forest virus, and leptospirosis, and with decreases in the occurrence of dermatitis, scabies, psoriasis, and papular urticaria. La Nina has been associated with increases in the occurrence of varicella, hand, foot, and mouth disease, and Ross River virus (in certain areas), and decreases in viral warts and leishmaniasis. Reports on the effects of ENSO on skin and skin-related disease are limited, and more studies could be helpful in the future.

TI  - Leaf diseases drive the Janzen-Connell mechanism regardless of light conditions: a 3-year field study
T2  - OECOLOGIA
AB  - In forests, negative density/distance-dependent seedling mortality (NDD) caused by natural enemies plays a key role in maintaining species diversity [Janzen-Connell (J-C) model]. However, the relative importance of natural enemies in mediating NDD under heterogeneous light conditions has remained unclear. We examined the relative importance of pathogens (i.e., soil pathogens, leaf diseases) on seedling performance in forest understories (FUs) and gaps (gaps) during a 3-year period (results of first year of our study have been previously reported). For the hardwood, Prunus grayana, we investigated seedling mortality, morbidity agents, growth, and root infection by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) beneath conspecific and heterospecific adults in FUs and gaps. Seedling mortality was higher beneath conspecific than heterospecific adults throughout 3 years at both sites, mainly due to continuous leaf disease (i.e., angular leaf spot), whereas damping-off diseases caused mortality only in the first year. Beneath each adult, seedling mortality was higher in FUs than in gaps until second year, but it did not differ between two habitat types in the third year, because leaf diseases caused severe damage even in gaps. Seedling mass was significantly lower beneath conspecific adults. AMF infection of seedlings was also lower beneath conspecific adults, while it was higher in gaps than in FUs beneath both adults. This study demonstrates that the J-C model in a hardwood tree, P. grayana is mainly driven by high NDD seedling mortality caused by airborne leaf diseases, which continuously attack seedlings in a NDD manner regardless of environmental light conditions.

TI  - VARIATION OF RAT SPECIES AND IDENTIFICATION OF LEPTOSPIROSIS IN SEVERAL TYPES OF ECOSYSTEMS IN SOUTHEAST SULAWESI PROVINCE
T2  - SOUTHEAST ASIAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Rat is one of the mammals of which species are studied related to their role as disease reservoirs of various tropical diseases. One of the diseases that is transmitted from rats to humans or other mammals is leptospirosis. The purpose of this study was to provide an overview of the variation of field-caught rat species in various ecosystems and the results of the leptospirosis examination in Southeast Sulawesi Province. The rats were caught using 100 live traps for three consecutive days. The locations of trapping were in six ecosystems: forests near and far from settlements, non-forest locations near and far from settlements, and coastal areas near and far from settlements. The results showed that the total number of rats caught was 339, consisting of 18 species. Several species were found, ie, Bunomys andrewsi, B. chrysocomus, B. coelestis, B. penitus, Maxomys musschenbroekii, M. watsi, Mus sp, Paruromys dominator, Rattus exulans, R. hoffmanni, R. marmosurus, R. nitidus, R. argentiventer, R. tanezumi, R. norvegicus, R. xanthurus, Rattus sp, and Taeromys celebensis. The most dominant species found was R. tanezumi. The sylvatic rat species such as Paruromys dominator were mostly found in forest and coastal ecosystems far from settlements. The results of laboratory tests using the microscopic agglutinin test (MAT) technique showed that 32 rats were positive for leptospirosis. The positive rat species were found near settlements in forest and coastal ecosystems. There were eight Leptospira serovars: Icterohaemorrhagiae, Hebdomadis, Djasiman, Bataviae, Bangkinang, Grippotyphosa, Pomona and Robinsoni. The study concludes that the variety of rat species in the research location was relatively wide. In addition, the serovars found were also varied. Moreover, one rat could contain more than one serovar. This study revealed that 32 rats positive containing Leptospira sp have the potential to be a source of transmission of leptospirosis to humans. Information on leptospirosis-positive rats is essential for the surveillance of leptospirosis in humans.

TI  - Two-year death prediction models among patients with Chagas Disease using machine learning-based methods
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Chagas disease (CD) is recognized by the World Health Organization as one of the thirteen most neglected tropical diseases. More than 80% of people affected by CD will not have access to diagnosis and continued treatment, which partly supports the high morbidity and mortality rate. Machine Learning (ML) can identify patterns in data that can be used to increase our understanding of a specific problem or make predictions about the future. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate different models of ML to predict death in two years of patients with CD. ML models were developed using different techniques and configurations. The techniques used were: Random Forests, Adaptive Boosting, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, and Artificial Neural Networks. The adopted settings considered only interview variables, only complementary exam variables, and finally, both mixed. Data from a cohort study with CD patients called SaMi-Trop were analyzed. The predictor variables came from the baseline; and the outcome, which was death, came from the first follow-up. All models were evaluated in terms of Sensitivity, Specificity and G-mean. Among the 1694 individuals with CD considered, 134 (7.9%) died within two years of follow-up. Using only the predictor variables from the interview, the different techniques achieved a maximum G-mean of 0.64 in predicting death. Using only the variables from complementary exams, the G-mean was up to 0.77. In this configuration, the protagonism of NT-proBNP was evident, where it was possible to observe that an ML model using only this single variable reached G-mean of 0.76. The configuration that mixed interview variables and complementary exams achieved G-mean of 0.75. ML can be used as a useful tool with the potential to contribute to the management of patients with CD, by identifying patients with the highest probability of death.

TI  - The long-term effects of thinning and mixing on species and structural diversity of Chinese fir plantations
T2  - NEW FORESTS
AB  - Plantations are playing an increasingly important role in providing forest products and improving the ecological environment, but they also face many challenges, such as low biodiversity, severe pest and disease problems, reduced productivity, and diminished soil fertility. Reasonable management strategies are vital for their sustainability. In this study, we took a Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata (Lamb.) Hook.) plantation as an example to demonstrate the effects of thinning and mixing on the species diversity and structural diversity of plantations at the stand level over a rotation period (1993-2018). An intermediate thinning (26% of plant abundance) was conducted in a Chinese fir pure plantation in mid-age (2008), and a mixed forest stand of Chinese fir and Michelia macclurei Dandy was established directly. Thinning and mixing greatly increased the species diversity at the stand level, enhanced the mixture, transformed the pattern from regular to random distribution, and made the size differentiation of trees random. Thinning and mixing also greatly improved the mixture and dominance of Chinese fir. M. macclurei had an obvious advantage in tree size and maintained a high mixture proportion. Moreover, the diameter classes of the stands were bimodal. Chinese fir and M. macclurei showed a unimodal distribution of diameter, but other later-coming species with a larger number of individuals displayed a typical reverse J-shaped distribution. Our results suggest that both thinning and mixed planting may promote species diversity and structure over a long timescale, but thinning achieves these characteristics earlier because thinning directly manipulates structure in a way that accelerates stand development.

T2  - PHYTOTAXA
AB  - Fungi belonging to the genus Cladosporium are cosmopolitan and occur in various substrates and hosts. Nevertheless, this is the first time that we have described this genus colonizing leaf litter submerged in water. We surveyed Cladosporium spp. associated with submerged leaf litter, from three localities belonging to the Atlantic Forest biome in the State of Minas Gerais, Brazil. A multilocus DNA sequence typing approach employing ITS, Actin, and Translation elongation factor 1-alpha region/genes associated with morphological and cultural analyses were used to identify these species. The species C. angulosum and C. anthropophilum are reported for the first time in Brazil, and a new species for the genus is described here as C. puris.

TI  - The influence of roads on the fine-scale population genetic structure of the dengue vector <i>Aedes aegypti</i> (Linnaeus)
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Author summary
   Dengue, a mosquito-borne viral infection is a serious health problem in tropical and subtropical countries such as Philippines. Most dengue prevention programs aim to eradicate its mosquito vector, Aedes aegypti. A successful population control program is reliant in understanding the mosquito behavior and ecology including how human-made structures such as roads influence its expansion and movement. Previous studies have discovered the barrier effect of roads in the movement of mosquitoes. In this study, we examined the influence of roads in the population genetic structure of Ae. aegypti in a fine spatial scale using 11 microsatellite markers. We found significant genetic differentiation of mosquito populations across the road. Our results suggest limited gene flow across the road and supports our hypothesis that roads are potential barriers to mosquito dispersal. This information can be used in designing an effective mosquito population control zones in perceived barrier to mosquito dispersal such as roads.
   Dengue is endemic in tropical and subtropical countries and is transmitted mainly by Aedes aegypti. Mosquito movement can be affected by human-made structures such as roads that can act as a barrier. Roads can influence the population genetic structure of Ae. aegypti. We investigated the genetic structure and gene flow of Ae. aegypti as influenced by a primary road, Espana Boulevard (EB) with 2000-meter-long stretch and 24-meters-wide in a very fine spatial scale. We hypothesized that Ae. aegypti populations separated by EB will be different due to the limited gene flow as caused by the barrier effect of the road. A total of 359 adults and 17 larvae Ae. aegypti were collected from June to September 2017 in 13 sites across EB. North (N1-N8) and South (S1-S5) comprised of 211 and 165 individuals, respectively. All mosquitoes were genotyped at 11 microsatellite loci. AMOVA F-ST indicated significant genetic differentiation across the road. The constructed UPGMA dendrogram found 3 genetic groups revealing the clear separation between North and South sites across the road. On the other hand, Bayesian cluster analysis showed four genetic clusters (K = 4) wherein each individual samples have no distinct genetic cluster thus genetic admixture. Our results suggest that human-made landscape features such as primary roads are potential barriers to mosquito movement thereby limiting its gene flow across the road. This information is valuable in designing an effective mosquito control program in a very fine spatial scale.

TI  - Epidemiology of malaria in Rohingya refugee camps in Bangladesh within 2017-2020
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
AB  - BackgroundMalaria causes significant morbidity and mortality in tropical and sub-tropical regions, particularly in humanitarian emergencies including refugee camps in malaria endemic areas. An epidemiological investigation was conducted on malaria disease distribution and risk factors in the world's largest refugee settlement, the Rohingya refugee camps on the south-eastern border area of Bangladesh, within 2017-2020.MethodsFrom February 2017 to March 2020, 30,460 febrile patients were tested for malaria using light microscopy and rapid diagnostic tests. Most were self-presenting symptomatic patients and a minority were from door-to-door malaria screening. Diagnostic tests were done by trained medical technologists upon the advice of the concerned physicians in the camps. Test positivity rate (%) and annual parasite incidence were calculated and compared using chi-squared (& chi; 2) test or odds ratios.ResultsThe overall average annual test positivity rate (TPR) was 0.05%. TPR was highest in people who had travelled to the forest in the previous 2 months, at 13.60%. Cases were clustered among male adults aged 15-60 years. There were no cases among children under five years or pregnant women and no deaths from malaria.ConclusionThis study found very few malaria cases among Rohingya refugees with the majority of cases being imported from hilly forested areas, which were thus assumed to act as the reservoir for transmission.

TI  - Gastrointestinal parasites of <i>Leontopithecus chrysomelas</i> in the Atlantic Forest, Brazil
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE PARASITOLOGIA VETERINARIA
AB  - We performed coproparasitological testing of free-living golden-headed lion tamarins, Leontopithecus chrysomelas, using the Hoffmann-Pons-Janner method. In total, we collected 118 samples from ten groups: four living in Federal Protected Area and six living in Non-Protected Areas of cocoa farms. Eggs from parasites of the Acanthocephala phylum and Spiruridae, Ancylostomatidae, Ascarididae and Oxyuridae families were identified, as well as the genus Strongyloides (Nematode: Strongyloididae) and phylum Apicomplexa. This is the first description of infection with coccidian, Trichuridae family and Strongyloides spp. in L. chrysomelas. A total of 48% (n= 57) of the animals were infected and the highest prevalence (37.2 +/- SD 8.72, n = 44) was for Acanthocephalidae, followed by Spiruridae (8.5 +/- SD 5.03, n = 10). There was no difference in parasite prevalence by age classes or sex. However, we found higher diversity and prevalence of parasites in animals living in the Federal Protected Area. These results suggest that intestinal parasites may be influenced by environmental factors, such as the management of the areas where the animals live, in addition to the feeding behavior of L. chrysomelas and distinct transmission strategies of parasites. The combination of ecological and demographic data combined with parasitological studies may contribute to conservation programs for this species.

TI  - Vector-borne transmission of <i>Trypanosoma</i> <i>cruzi</i> among captive Neotropical primates in a Brazilian zoo
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
AB  - Background: Neotropical primates are important sylvatic hosts of Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas disease. Infection is often subclinical, but severe disease has been described in both free-ranging and captive primates. Panstrongylus megistus, a major T. cruzi vector, was found infesting a small-primate unit at Brasilia zoo (ZooB), Brazil. ZooB lies close to a gallery-forest patch where T. cruzi circulates naturally. Here, we combine parasitological and molecular methods to investigate a focus of T. cruzi infection involving triatomine bugs and Neotropical primates at a zoo located in the Brazilian Savannah.
   Methods: We assessed T. cruzi infection in vectors using optical microscopy (n = 34) and nested PCR (n = 50). We used quantitative PCR (qPCR) to examine blood samples from 26 primates and necropsy samples from two primates that died during the study. We determined parasite lineages in five vectors and two primates by comparing glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (G6pi) gene sequences.
   Results: Trypanosoma cruzi was found in 44 vectors and 17 primates (six genera and eight species); one Mico chrysoleucus and one Saguinus niger had high parasitaemias. Trypanosoma cruzi DNA was detected in three primates born to qPCR-negative mothers at ZooB and in the two dead specimens. One Callithrix geoffroyi became qPCR-positive over a two-year follow-up. All G6pi sequences matched T. cruzi lineage Td.
   Conclusions: Our findings strongly suggest vector-borne T. cruzi transmission within a small-primate unit at ZooB - with vectors, and perhaps also parasites, presumably coming from nearby gallery forest. Periodic checks for vectors and parasites would help eliminate T. cruzi transmission foci in captive-animal facilities. This should be of special importance for captive-breeding programs involving endangered mammals, and would reduce the risk of accidental T. cruzi transmission to keepers and veterinarians.

TI  - SUBMERGED CULTIVATION OF BASIDIOMYCETE FUNGI ASSOCIATED WITH ROOT DISEASES FOR PRODUCTION OF VALUABLE BIOACTIVE METABOLITES
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL FOREST SCIENCE
AB  - This study is part of a screening programme aimed at searching for bioactive metabolites From basidiomycete fungi belonging to the order Polyporales. These fungi are commonly associated with root diseases in forest tree species and agricultural Crops. Submerged cultivation of fungal mycelia in liquid media could reduce the time spent in obtaining antimicrobial metabolities. A total of 112 butanol extracts prepared from broth cultures of fungi belonging to several special of genera Phellinus, Ganoderma, Rigidoporus, Tinctoporellus and Lentinus, and some unidentified polypore species, were evaluated for antimicrobial activity against Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Rhodotorulla glutinis. Differences in antimicrobial activities observed in the different fungal genera suggested that the ability to produce bioactive compounds is not homogenously distributed among basidiomycetes. In the primary antimicrobial assay, a total of 26(23.2%) extracts exhibited strong antimicrobial activity with percentage of inhibition concentration (%IC) >= 90% against one or more of the test micro-organisms. Anti-bacterial activity was more pronounced than antifungal activity. Ten extracts that exhibited strong alitibacterial activity showed minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of <= 0.125 mu g mu l(-1) against B. subtilis in a secondary assay.

TI  - Molecular phylogeny, diversity, symbiosis and discover of bioactive compounds of endophytic fungi associated with the medicinal Amazonian plant <i>Carapa guianensis</i> Aublet (<i>Meliaceae</i>)
T2  - BIOCHEMICAL SYSTEMATICS AND ECOLOGY
AB  - We investigated the endophytic fungal community associated with the Amazonian medicinal plant Carapa guianensis and its potential for providing bioactive compounds. A total of 162 endophytic fungal isolates were obtained and identified by molecular methods. These isolates were classified into 35 different taxa in the genera Aspergilllus, Beltrania, Botryosphaeria, Colletotrichum, Diaporthe, Endomelanconiopsis, Fusarium, Guignardia, Pestalotiopsis, Phomopsis, Pilidiella, Trichoderma, and Xylaria. The most frequent colonisers recovered of C. guianensis were Colletotrichum sp. 1, Diaporthe cf. mayteni, and Pestalotiopsis sp. 1. The fungal community had a moderate richness but high diversity and evenness indices. Colletotrichum sp. and Pilidiella wangiensis displayed selective antibacterial activity; Diaporthe cf. mayteni and Endomelanconiopsis endophytica showed high activity against amastigote forms of Trypanosoma cruzi; and Colletrotrichum sp. Guignardia mangiferae, Pestalotiopsis sp., and Diaporthe melonis were able to inhibit yellow fever virus proliferation. Our results suggest that the plants living in the tropical forest, such as the Amazonian hotspot region, can live in symbiosis with hidden and underestimated rich communities of endophytic fungi, which deserve protocols and/or specific laws to keep its future conservation. The capability of these endophytic fungi to produce bioactive compounds may be part of their chemical defense and adaptive response to survive and colonizing the plant host in wild environment. consequently, these fungal communities may provide a source of bioactive molecules, including those able to inhibit or control neglected tropical diseases.

TI  - Study of the phlebotomines (Diptera, Psychodidae), in area of cutaneous leishmaniasis in the Mato Grosso do Sul State, Brazil
T2  - REVISTA DE SAUDE PUBLICA
AB  - Studies of the phlebotomine sandflies on the Boa Sorte farm, Corguinho county, State of Mato Grosso do Sul, Central-West region of Brazil, were carried out, with the object of identifying local fauna and a cutaneous leishmaniasis vector. At the beginning of the studies, several types of primitive vegetation covering: gallery forest, forest slopes and the cerrados: s. str. and tropical xeromorphic semideciduous broadleaf forest, locally denominated ''croa'', existed. Four months after the beginning of the studies, a fire destroyed a significant part of the cerrados. Captures were made during the interval from July/91 to June/93, with a CDC trap, weekly, at 10 ecotopes: in the soil of forest slopes; in the soil and canopy of cerrado s. str., ''croa'' and gallery forest; in the peridomicile, in hen house and pigpen and in a storage shed. A Shannon's trap was used, monthly, from 18:00-24:00 hours, in the gallery forest and ''croa''. Human bait was used, monthly, for 24 hours, from June/91 to September/92. An investigation into natural infection in female phlebotomines was made through the dissection of specimens captured in the Shannon's trap and on human bait. The captures with CDC totalled in 2,281 specimens of 26 species: 2 of Brumptomyia and 24 of Lutzomyia. The ''croa'' was the environment that contributed with the greatest number of specimens and presented the largest diversity, together with the forest slope. L. withmani was the most abundant species captured with CDC, in all the ecotypes (Standardized abundance index = 0.991). However, in the storage shed its frequence was the lowest. This species presented a prevalence of 96.0% in the Shannon's trap and on human bait (3265 and 516 specimens, respectively). It was the most frequent in the cold and dry period. It presented almost exclusively nocturnal activity, with its peak at 18:00-19:00 hours and an infection rate by flagellates of 0.16% (613 females dissected). On the basis of its behavior, this species was incriminated as the probable vector of the cutaneous leishmaniasis in the area, which had extradomicilary transmission. L. lenti, the second most abundant species, is not anthropophilic. The phlebotomine fauna is presented by environment.

T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY, VOL 129
CP  - 129th Annual Meeting of the Florida-State-Horticultural-Society
AB  - Florida's ornamental plant industry flourishes due to environmental conditions that allow for a 12-month growing season. Florida leads the nation in production of tropical foliage, and Miami-Dade County ranks number one in nursery and landscape production with sales reaching $2 billion annually. The well-advertised El Nino pattern made its presence felt this past winter in south Florida with the wettest conditions since record keeping began in 1932. As a result, ornamental nursery growers contended with a higher incidence of root rots, crown rots, and foliar blight diseases, confirmed by samples submitted to the University of Florida's Extension Plant Diagnostic Clinic in Homestead, FL. The present study focused on environmental conditions occurring over the past 4 years and included rainfall, solar radiation, and temperature variables and examined their influence on the incidence of diseases affecting ornamental plants. Results indicated Pythium and Phytophthora species as the primary plant pathogens responsible for these diseases. The drastic increase of diagnostic samples identified as Pythium and Phytophthora can be attributed to the unusually wet weather experienced. These two oomycetes are well known for causing disease under wet conditions and growers should closely monitor weather forecasts and practice preventative disease management accordingly.

TI  - Development and validation of consensus machine learning-based models for the prediction of novel small molecules as potential anti-tubercular agents
T2  - MOLECULAR DIVERSITY
AB  - Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease and the leading cause of death globally. The rapidly emerging cases of drug resistance among pathogenic mycobacteria have been a global threat urging the need of new drug discovery and development. However, considering the fact that the new drug discovery and development is commonly lengthy and costly processes, strategic use of the cutting-edge machine learning (ML) algorithms may be very supportive in reducing both the cost and time involved. Considering the urgency of new drugs for TB, herein, we have attempted to develop predictive ML algorithms-based models useful in the selection of novel potential small molecules for subsequent in vitro validation. For this purpose, we used the GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) TCAMS TB dataset comprising a total of 776 hits that were made publicly available to the wider scientific community through the ChEMBL Neglected Tropical Diseases (ChEMBL-NTD) database. After exploring the different ML classifiers, viz. decision trees (DT), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), Bernoulli Naive Bayes (BNB), K-nearest neighbors (k-NN), and linear logistic regression (LLR), and ensemble learning models (bagging and Adaboost) for training the model using the GSK dataset, we concluded with three best models, viz. Adaboost decision tree (ABDT), RF classifier, and k-NN models that gave the top prediction results for both the training and test sets. However, during the prediction of the external set of known anti-tubercular compounds/drugs, it was realized that each of these models had some limitations. The ABDT model correctly predicted 22 molecules as actives, while both the RF and k-NN models predicted 18 molecules correctly as actives; a number of molecules were predicted as actives by two of these models, while the third model predicted these compounds as inactives. Therefore, we concluded that while deciding the anti-tubercular potential of a new molecule, one should rely on the use of consensus predictions using these three models; it may lessen the attrition rate during the in vitro validation. We believe that this study may assist the wider anti-tuberculosis research community by providing a platform for predicting small molecules with subsequent validation for drug discovery and development.

TI  - Global status of synchronizing Leishmania RNA virus in Leishmania parasites: A systematic review with meta-analysis
T2  - TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES
AB  - Leishmaniasis is one of the most neglected tropical diseases caused by protozoan parasites belonging to the genus Leishmania. There is much evidence regarding prevalence of Leishmania RNAvirus (LRV) causing Old World leishmaniasis (OWL) and New World leishmaniasis (NWL); however, a combined evidence-based knowledge on this topic is not still available. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to address the global status of synchronizing LRV in Leishmania in the available literature. The data were systematically collected from the English electronic databases up to May 2018. Then, the studies were screened based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The random-effect model was used by forest plot with 95% confidence interval (CI). Overall, 877 samples from 17 articles were included in this study. Given species of Leishmania, the highest prevalence of LRV belonged to Leishmania (L.) Viannia (V.) guyanensis and L. V. braziliensis. Additionally, the virus was detected also in L. V. amazonensis, L. V. panamanensis, L. V. lainsoni, L. aethiopica, L. major and L. infantum. By random-effect model, the global prevalence of LRV was estimated to be 26.2% (95% CI: 14.4% - 40.1%). The high prevalence of LRV among causative agents of NWLisolated from the metastatic clinical forms suggests potential association of LRV with metastatic clinical forms in New World endemic regions. A comprehensive investigation on experimental and clinical aspects of LRV is needed to fully appraise the role of these viruses in pathogenicity of Leishmania parasites and their drug resistance.

TI  - A mobility model for classical swine fever in feral pig populations
T2  - VETERINARY RESEARCH
AB  - We present a simulation model which explicitly captures the movement of wild animals over the landscape and the effect which herd mobility has on the temporal and spatial course of an epidemic. Using the example of classical swine fever in feral pig populations in the tropical savannas, we demonstrate that seasonal factors influencing population density and movement patterns are an important factor in the transmission of the disease. Pig population density is much greater at the start of the dry season than at the start of the wet season, with an epidemic most likely to occur if initiated at the start of the dry season. Spatial heterogeneity due to scarcity of water in the dry season causes herds to congregate around water sources. This concentration of herds, and the consequential isolation of sub-populations, reduces overall disease transmission compared with a model where the population is more evenly distributed over the landscape. The presence of adult male pig herds, which travel over greater distances than family herds, is shown to increase the overall scale of an outbreak in the dry season by connecting together otherwise isolated family herds. Eradication strategies are more likely to be successful in the dry season if they target long-range adult male herds. Our simulation method is generic and is equally applicable to other diseases where the host species is mobile.

TI  - Residual Effectiveness of λ-Cyhalothrin Harbourage Sprays Against Foliage-Resting Mosquitoes in North Queensland
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - The residual efficacy of lambda-cyhalothrin sprayed on foliage was evaluated against various mosquito species in sections of forest in Cairns, Queensland, Australia. Weekly sweep-net collections in treated and untreated areas before and after spraying showed 87D100% reductions in mosquito numbers for the first 9 wk postspray. After that period, reductions fluctuated but remained >71% up to 14 wk posttreatment. Mosquito mortality ranged from 96 to 100% in contact bioassays of treated leaves during the 14 wk study. Our results demonstrate that spraying harborage vegetation with lambda-cyhalothrin is an extremely effective strategy for the control of sylvan and peridomestic mosquito species in tropical north Queensland.

TI  - Fiocruz Biological Collections: strengthening Brazil's biodiversity knowledge and scientific applications opportunities
T2  - BIODIVERSITY DATA JOURNAL
AB  - Biological collections are central in understanding and preserving life on Earth. In Brazil, the most representative collections are kept by natural history museums, whose primary focus is in invertebrates, vertebrates and vascular plants. Only a few institutions keep repositories in different kingdoms. The Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz), established in 1900, is a strategic public health institution of the Ministry of Health of Brazil. As such, Fiocruz is responsible for a wide range of activities, from basic research to the development and production of vaccines, drugs, reagents and diagnostic kits. Its biological collections were soon established in the expeditions made by naturalists and physicians seeking integrated knowledge of the fauna, flora and tropical diseases. Since then, they have been part of the institutional policy. In a few decades, those collections were already in the forefront of basic and applied research on tropical parasitic and infectious diseases. Currently, they comprise thirty-three repositories representing part of the Brazilian diversity of bacteria, fungi, protozoa, helminths, arthropods, molluscs and plants of medical and environmental importance. Different methods of long-term preservation are applied for the conservation of this wide range of organisms represented by about 6 million specimens. Herein, we describe this range of collections and discuss their complementary role as repositories of groups not represented in other biological collections in Brazil. These valuable biological materials have been used in public health and medical research, as well as for technological development and innovation in Brazil. Parallel to this specific usage, Fiocruz biological collections have played and continue to play a unique and important role in understanding and conserving part of Brazil's biodiversity that is currently under-represented in other biological and natural history collections in Brazil and South America.

TI  - Mapping of Land Cover with Optical Images, Supervised Algorithms, and Google Earth Engine
T2  - SENSORS
AB  - Crops and ecosystems constantly change, and risks are derived from heavy rains, hurricanes, droughts, human activities, climate change, etc. This has caused additional damages with economic and social impacts. Natural phenomena have caused the loss of crop areas, which endangers food security, destruction of the habitat of species of flora and fauna, and flooding of populations, among others. To help in the solution, it is necessary to develop strategies that maximize agricultural production as well as reduce land wear, environmental impact, and contamination of water resources. The generation of crop and land-use maps is advantageous for identifying suitable crop areas and collecting precise information about the produce. In this work, a strategy is proposed to identify and map sorghum and corn crops as well as land use and land cover. Our approach uses Sentinel-2 satellite images, spectral indices for the phenological detection of vegetation and water bodies, and automatic learning methods: support vector machine, random forest, and classification and regression trees. The study area is a tropical agricultural area with water bodies located in southeastern Mexico. The study was carried out from 2017 to 2019, and considering the climate and growing seasons of the site, two seasons were created for each year. Land use was identified as: water bodies, land in recovery, urban areas, sandy areas, and tropical rainforest. The results in overall accuracy were: 0.99% for the support vector machine, 0.95% for the random forest, and 0.92% for classification and regression trees. The kappa index was: 0.99% for the support vector machine, 0.97% for the random forest, and 0.94% for classification and regression trees. The support vector machine obtained the lowest percentage of false positives and margin of error. It also acquired better results in the classification of soil types and identification of crops.

TI  - Where are all the undescribed fungi?
T2  - PHYTOPATHOLOGY
AB  - The hypothesis that there are 1.5 million fungal species on Earth, of which only about 70,000 are described, implies that 1.43 million remain undescribed. The recognition that many new species have yet to be found is of fundamental importance to plant pathologists, agronomists, and plant regulatory officials, among others, who continue to encounter diseases caused by previously unknown or understudied fungi. Unexplored habitats with their arsenal of unknown fungi are also of interest to those searching for novel organisms for use in biological control or for their pharmaceutical attributes. This paper presents data on the expected numbers of fungi in some relatively unexplored habitats, such as tropical forests, and those obligately associated with plants, lichens, and insects.
   In addition to undiscovered species, many have been collected but remain lost or hidden as named species and ignored for lack of modern characterization; others have been collected and recognized as new species but remain undescribed. Some fungal species are unrecognized within erroneously circumscribed species, often based on presumed host specificity, while others exist as biological species but remain buried within those broadly defined species for lack of gross morphological characterization. From these data, one must conclude that enormous numbers of unrecognized fungi can be found almost everywhere, including one's own backyard.

TI  - High resolution paddy rice maps in cloud-prone Bangladesh and Northeast India using Sentinel-1 data
T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
AB  - Knowledge of where, when, and how much paddy rice is planted is crucial information for understating of regional food security, freshwater use, climate change, and transmission of avian influenza virus. We developed seasonal paddy rice maps at high resolution (10 m) for Bangladesh and Northeast India, typical cloud-prone regions in South Asia, using cloud-free Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images from Sentinel-1 satellite, the Random Forest classifier, and the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform. The maps were provided for all the three distinct rice growing seasons of the region: Boro, Aus and Aman. The paddy rice maps were evaluated against the independent validation samples, and compared with the existing products from the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) and the analysis of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. The generated paddy rice maps were spatially consistent with the compared maps and had a satisfactory accuracy over 90%. This study showed the potential of Sentinel-1 data and GEE on large scale paddy rice mapping in cloud-prone regions like tropical Asia.

TI  - Lymphatic filariasis elimination in the Dominican Republic: History, progress, and remaining steps
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Author summary Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a neglected tropical disease caused by thin worms transmitted to humans by the bites of mosquitoes. LF is a leading cause of disability globally, resulting from the long-term physical (swelling of legs and genitals) and psycho-social impacts on affected individuals. The Dominican Republic is one of four LF-endemic countries in the Americas. This report describes the efforts to eliminate the disease in the country, including a review of disease mapping and implementation of mass drug administration (MDA)-the provision of safe and effective medicine to at-risk communities-to interrupt parasite transmission. Particular emphasis is given to program planning and community mobilization for MDA due to the divergent environments of endemic foci, which ranged from rural agricultural regions to densely populated urban neighborhoods. Impact evaluation data for each focus demonstrates interruption of LF transmission and that criteria to stop MDA have been met. Finally, plans for post-treatment surveillance and the scale-up of clinical care services for those who remain affected by chronic LF are presented-required elements for eliminating LF as a public health problem.
   Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a mosquito-transmitted parasitic disease that is a leading cause of disability globally. The island of Hispaniola, which the Dominican Republic shares with Haiti, accounts for approximately 90% of LF cases in the Americas region. In 1998, the Dominican Ministry of Public Health created the Program to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (PELF) with the goal of eliminating LF transmission by 2020. Baseline mapping revealed 19 (12% of total) endemic municipalities clustered into three geographic foci (Southwest, La Cienaga and East), with a total at-risk population of 262,395 people. Beginning in 2002, PELF sequentially implemented mass drug administration (MDA) in these foci using albendazole and diethylcarbamazine (DEC). In total, 1,174,050 treatments were given over three to five annual rounds of house-to-house MDA per focus with a median coverage of 81.7% (range 67.4%-92.2%). By 2018, LF antigen prevalence was less than 2% in all foci, thus meeting criteria to stop MDA and begin post-treatment surveillance (PTS). This success has been achieved against a shifting landscape of limited domestic funding, competing domestic public health priorities, and sporadic external donor support. Remaining steps include the need to scale-up morbidity management and disability prevention services for LF and to continue PTS until LF transmission is interrupted across Hispaniola.

TI  - Data-driven predictions of potential Leishmania vectors in the Americas
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Author summaryAmerican Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (ACL) is a neglected disease caused by sandfly-transmitted parasites in the Americas. There is an incomplete understanding of which sandfly species transmit the parasite, complicating efforts to limit parasite transmission and consequently, disease burden. In this study, the authors created a database of sandfly traits, then used predictive models to determine important factors in parasite transmission and how different climate and environmental variables predict which vectors can transmit the parasites that cause ACL. The models suggest that transmission occurs at the interface between domestic habitats and well-preserved forests. The authors also generate predictions of which sandflies might be transmitting the parasites that are not known vectors at the time, specifically Psychodopygus amazonensis and Nyssomia antunesi. This new knowledge can lead to a better understanding of the system of transmission and can point to possible hotspots of risk. The analysis can also help direct researchers to areas of interest for sampling studies, as well as specific sandflies on which to focus effort.
   The incidence of vector-borne diseases is rising as deforestation, climate change, and globalization bring humans in contact with arthropods that can transmit pathogens. In particular, incidence of American Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (ACL), a disease caused by parasites transmitted by sandflies, is increasing as previously intact habitats are cleared for agriculture and urban areas, potentially bringing people into contact with vectors and reservoir hosts. Previous evidence has identified dozens of sandfly species that have been infected with and/or transmit Leishmania parasites. However, there is an incomplete understanding of which sandfly species transmit the parasite, complicating efforts to limit disease spread. Here, we apply machine learning models (boosted regression trees) to leverage biological and geographical traits of known sandfly vectors to predict potential vectors. Additionally, we generate trait profiles of confirmed vectors and identify important factors in transmission. Our model performed well with an average out of sample accuracy of 86%. The models predict that synanthropic sandflies living in areas with greater canopy height, less human modification, and within an optimal range of rainfall are more likely to be Leishmania vectors. We also observed that generalist sandflies that are able to inhabit many different ecoregions are more likely to transmit the parasites. Our results suggest that Psychodopygus amazonensis and Nyssomia antunesi are unidentified potential vectors, and should be the focus of sampling and research efforts. Overall, we found that our machine learning approach provides valuable information for Leishmania surveillance and management in an otherwise complex and data sparse system.

TI  - Optimal Strategies for Controlling Riverine Tsetse Flies Using Targets: A Modelling Study
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   Tsetse flies occur in much of sub-Saharan Africa where they transmit the trypanosomes that cause the diseases of sleeping sickness in humans and nagana in livestock. One of the most economical and effective methods of tsetse control is the use of insecticide-treated screens, called targets, that simulate hosts. Targets have been similar to 1m(2), but recently it was shown that those tsetse that occupy riverine situations, and which are the main vectors of sleeping sickness, respond well to targets only similar to 0.06m(2). The cheapness of these tiny targets suggests the need to reconsider what intensity and duration of target deployments comprise the most cost-effective strategy in various riverine habitats.
   Methodology/Principal Findings
   A deterministic model, written in Excel spreadsheets and managed by Visual Basic for Applications, simulated the births, deaths and movement of tsetse confined to a strip of riverine vegetation composed of segments of habitat in which the tsetse population was either self-sustaining, or not sustainable unless supplemented by immigrants. Results suggested that in many situations the use of tiny targets at high density for just a few months per year would be the most cost-effective strategy for rapidly reducing tsetse densities by the similar to 90% expected to have a great impact on the incidence of sleeping sickness. Local elimination of tsetse becomes feasible when targets are deployed in isolated situations, or where the only invasion occurs from populations that are not self-sustaining.
   Conclusion/Significance
   Seasonal use of tiny targets deserves field trials. The ability to recognise habitat that contains tsetse populations which are not self-sustaining could improve the planning of all methods of tsetse control, against any species, in riverine, savannah or forest situations. Criteria to assist such recognition are suggested.

TI  - Virucidal antiviral activity of<i> Maytenus</i><i> quadrangulata</i> extract against Mayaro virus: Evidence for the presence of catechins
T2  - JOURNAL OF ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY
AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Mayaro virus (MAYV) is an arbovirus endemic to the Amazon region, which comprises the states of the North and Midwest region of Brazil and encompasses the largest tropical forest in the world, the Amazon Forest. The confirmation of its potential transmission by Aedes aegypti and recent cases in Brazil, mainly in large centers in the northern region, led to the classification of Mayaro fever as an emerging disease. Traditional medicine is commonly used to treat various diseases, mainly by local riverside populations. Some species of the genus Maytenus, which have similar morphologies, are popularly used to treat infections and inflammations. In this context, our research group has studied and confirmed the antiviral activity of several plant-derived compounds. However, several species of this same genus have not been studied and therefore deserve attention. Aim of the study: This study aimed to demonstrate the effects of ethyl acetate extracts of leaves (LAE) and branches (TAE) of Maytenus quadrangulata against MAYV. Materials and methods: Mammalian cells (Vero cells) were used to evaluate the cytotoxicity of the extracts. After cell infection by MAYV and the treatment with the extracts, we evaluated the selectivity index (SI), the virucidal effect, viral adsorption and internalization, and the effect on viral gene expression. The antiviral action was confirmed by quantifying the viral genome using RT-qPCR and by analyzing the effect on virus yield in infected cells. The treatment was performed based on the effective concentration protective for 50% of the infected cells (EC50). Results: The leaves (LAE; EC50 12.0 & mu;g/mL) and branches (TAE; EC50 101.0 & mu;g/mL) extracts showed significative selectivity against the virus, with SI values of 79.21 and 9.91, respectively, which were considered safe. Phytochemical analysis revealed that the antiviral action was associated with the presence of catechins, mainly in LAE. This extract was chosen for the subsequent studies since it reduced the viral cytopathic effect and virus production, even at high viral loads [MOI (multiplicity of infection) 1 and 5]. The effects of LAE resulted in a marked reduction in viral gene expression. The viral title was drastically reduced when LAE was added to the virus before infection or during replication stages, reducing virus production up to 5-log units compared to infected and untreated cells.

TI  - Effect of sampling methods, effective population size and migration rate estimation in <i>Glossina palpalis palpalis</i> from Cameroon
T2  - INFECTION GENETICS AND EVOLUTION
AB  - Human and animal trypanosomiases are two major constraints to development in Africa. These diseases are mainly transmitted by tsetse flies in particular by Glossina palpalis palpalis in Western and Central Africa. To set up an effective vector control campaign, prior population genetics studies have proved useful. Previous studies on population genetics of G. p. palpalis using microsatellite loci showed high heterozygote deficits, as compared to Hardy-Weinberg expectations, mainly explained by the presence of null alleles and/or the mixing of individuals belonging to several reproductive units (Wahlund effect). In this study we implemented a system of trapping, consisting of a central trap and two to four satellite traps around the central one to evaluate a possible role of the Wahlund effect in tsetse flies from three Cameroon human and animal African trypanosomiases foci (Campo, Bipindi and Fontem). We also estimated effective population sizes and dispersal. No difference was observed between the values of allelic richness, genetic diversity and Wright's F-IS, in the samples from central and from satellite traps, suggesting an absence of Wahlund effect. Partitioning of the samples with Bayesian methods showed numerous clusters of 2-3 individuals as expected from a population at demographic equilibrium with two expected offspring per reproducing female. As previously shown, null alleles appeared as the most probable factor inducing these heterozygote deficits in these populations. Effective population sizes varied from 80 to 450 individuals while immigration rates were between 0.05 and 0.43, showing substantial genetic exchanges between different villages within a focus. These results suggest that the "suppression" with establishment of physical barriers may be the best strategy for a vector control campaign in this forest context. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - The practicality of Malaysia dengue outbreak forecasting model as an early warning system
T2  - INFECTIOUS DISEASE MODELLING
AB  - Dengue is a harmful tropical disease that causes death to many people. Currently, the dengue vaccine development is still at an early stage, and only intervention methods exist after dengue cases increase. Thus, previously, two scientific experimental field studies were conducted in producing a dengue outbreak forecasting model as an early warning system. Successfully, an Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ADL) Model was developed using three factors: the epidemiological, entomological, and environmental with an accuracy of 85%; but a higher percentage is required in minimizing the error for the model to be useful. Hence, this study aimed to develop a practical and cost-effective dengue outbreak fore-casting model with at least 90% accuracy to be embedded in an early warning computer system using the Internet of Things (IoT) approach. Eighty-one weeks of time series data of the three factors were used in six forecasting models, which were Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ADL), Hierarchical Forecasting (Bottom-up and Optimal combination) and three Machine Learning methods: (Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Ma-chine (SVM) and Random Forest). Five error measures were used to evaluate the consis-tency performance of the models in order to ensure model performance. The findings indicated Random Forest outperformed the other models with an accuracy of 95% when including all three factors. But practically, collecting mosquito related data (the entomo-logical factor) was very costly and time consuming. Thus, it was removed from the model, and the accuracy dropped to 92% but still high enough to be of practical use, i.e., beyond 90%. However, the practical ground operationalization of the early warning system also requires several rain gauges to be located at the dengue hot spots due to localized rainfall. Hence, further analysis was conducted in determining the location of the rain gauges. This has led to the recommendation that the rain gauges should be located about 3-4 km apart at the dengue hot spots to ensure the accuracy of the rainfall data to be included in the dengue outbreak forecasting model so that it can be embedded in the early warning system. Therefore, this early warning system can save lives, and prevention is better than cure. (c) 2022 The Authors. Publishing services by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of KeAi Communications Co. Ltd.

TI  - Widespread amphibian extinctions from epidemic disease driven by global warming
T2  - NATURE
AB  - As the Earth warms, many species are likely to disappear, often because of changing disease dynamics. Here we show that a recent mass extinction associated with pathogen outbreaks is tied to global warming. Seventeen years ago, in the mountains of Costa Rica, the Monteverde harlequin frog ( Atelopus sp.) vanished along with the golden toad ( Bufo periglenes). An estimated 67% of the 110 or so species of Atelopus, which are endemic to the American tropics, have met the same fate, and a pathogenic chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis) is implicated. Analysing the timing of losses in relation to changes in sea surface and air temperatures, we conclude with 'very high confidence' (>99%, following the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC) that large-scale warming is a key factor in the disappearances. We propose that temperatures at many highland localities are shifting towards the growth optimum of Batrachochytrium, thus encouraging outbreaks. With climate change promoting infectious disease and eroding biodiversity, the urgency of reducing greenhouse-gas concentrations is now undeniable.

TI  - Soils of the Brazilian Coastal Plains biome: prediction of chemical attributes via portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) spectrometry and robust prediction models
T2  - SOIL RESEARCH
AB  - Portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) spectrometry has been successfully used for soil attribute prediction. However, recent studies have shown that accurate predictions may vary according to soil type and environmental conditions, motivating investigations in different biomes. Hence, this work attempted to accurately predict soil pH, sum of bases (SB), cation exchange capacity (CEC) at pH 7.0 and base saturation (BS) using pXRF-obtained data with high variability and robust prediction models in the Brazilian Coastal Plains biome. A total of 285 soil samples were collected to generate prediction models for A (n= 123), B (n= 162) and A+B (n= 285) horizons through stepwise multiple linear regression, support vector machine with linear kernel (SVM) and random forest. Data were divided into calibration (75%) and validation (25%) sets. Accuracy of the predictions was assessed by coefficient of determination (R-2), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and residual prediction deviation (RPD). The A+B horizons dataset had optimal performance, especially for SB predictions using SVM, achievingR(2)= 0.82, RMSE = 1.02 cmol(c)dm(-3), MAE = 1.17 cmol(c)dm(-3)and RPD = 2.33. The most important predictor variable was Ca. Predictions using pXRF data were accurate especially for SB. Limitations of the predictions caused by soil classes and environmental conditions should be further investigated in other regions.

TI  - Discovery of a novel alphavirus related to Eilat virus
T2  - JOURNAL OF GENERAL VIROLOGY
AB  - Most alphaviruses are transmitted by arthropods and infect vertebrate hosts. An exception is Eilat virus (EILV), the only described alphavirus with a host range restricted to insects. We established a new generic reverse transcription PCR assay for alphaviruses and tested 8860 tropical mosquitoes. We detected a novel alphavirus, tentatively named Tai Forest alphavirus (TALV), in Culex decens mosquitoes collected in Ivory Coast. The full genome was sequenced, and closest similarity was found to EILV. Pairwise amino acid identities to EILV ranged between 67 and 88% for the corresponding proteins, suggesting that TALV defines a proposed new alphavirus species. Phylogenetic analyses placed TALV as a sister species to EILV with a basal relationship to the western equine encephalitis virus complex. In comparison to the highly abundant insect-specific flaviviruses, insect-specific alphaviruses seem to be rare. This new PCR assay can detect novel alphaviruses and may facilitate the identification of additional new alphaviruses.

TI  - Multiple invasions, <i>Wolbachia</i> and human-aided transport drive the genetic variability of <i>Aedes albopictus</i> in the Iberian Peninsula
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - The Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, is one of the most invasive species in the world. Native to the tropical forests of Southeast Asia, over the past 30 years it has rapidly spread throughout tropical and temperate regions of the world. Its dramatic expansion has resulted in public health concerns as a consequence of its vector competence for at least 16 viruses. Previous studies showed that Ae. albopictus spread has been facilitated by human-mediated transportation, but much remains unknown about how this has affected its genetic attributes. Here we examined the factors that contributed to shaping the current genetic constitution of Ae. albopictus in the Iberian Peninsula, where the species was first found in 2004, by combining population genetics and Bayesian modelling. We found that both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA markers showed a lack of genetic structure and the presence of worldwide dominant haplotypes, suggesting regular introductions from abroad. Mitochondrial DNA showed little genetic diversity compared to nuclear DNA, likely explained by infection with maternally transmitted bacteria of the genus Wolbachia. Multilevel models revealed that greater mosquito fluxes (estimated from commuting patterns and tiger mosquito population distribution) and spatial proximity between sampling sites were associated with lower nuclear genetic distance, suggesting that rapid short- and medium-distance dispersal is facilitated by humans through vehicular traffic. This study highlights the significant role of human transportation in shaping the genetic attributes of Ae. albopictus and promoting regional gene flow, and underscores the need for a territorially integrated surveillance across scales of this disease-carrying mosquito.

TI  - <i>Mycobacterium ulcerans</i> in wild animals
T2  - REVUE SCIENTIFIQUE ET TECHNIQUE-OFFICE INTERNATIONAL DES EPIZOOTIES
AB  - Mycobacterium ulcerans infection, or Buruli ulcer, is the third most frequent mycobacterial disease in humans, often causing serious deformities and disability. The disease is most closely associated with tropical wetlands, especially in west and central Africa. Most investigators believe that the aetiological agent proliferates in mud beneath stagnant waters. Modes of transmission may involve direct contact with the contaminated environment, aerosols from water surfaces, and water-dwelling fauna (e.g. insects). Person-to-person transmission is rare. Trauma at the site of skin contamination by M. ulcerans appears to play an important role in initiating disease. Once introduced into the skin or subcutaneous tissue, M. ulcerans multiplies and produces a toxin that causes necrosis. However, the type of disease induced varies from a localised nodule or ulcer,to widespread ulcerative or non-ulcerative disease and osteomyelitis.
   Although culture of M. ulcerans from a patient was first reported in 1948, attempts to culture the mycobacterium from many specimens of flora and fauna have been unsuccessful. Failure to cultivate this organism from nature may be attributable to inadequate sampling, conditions of transport, decontamination and culture of this fastidious heat-sensitive organism, and to a long generation time relative to that of other environmental mycobacteria. Nevertheless, recent molecular studies using specific primers have revealed M. ulcerans in water, mud, fish and insects. Although no natural reservoir has been found, the possibility that M. ulcerans may colonise microfauna such as free-living amoebae has not been investigated.
   The host range of experimental infection by M. ulcerans includes lizards, amphibians, chick embryos, possums, armadillos, rats, mice and cattle. Natural infections have been observed only in Australia, in koalas, ringtail possums and a captive alpaca. The lesions were clinically identical to those observed in humans. Mycobacterium ulcerans infection is a rapidly re-emerging disease in some developing tropical countries. The re-emergence may be related to environmental and socioeconomic factors, for example, deforestation leading to increased flooding, and population expansion without improved agricultural techniques, th us putting more people at risk. Eradication of diseases related to these factors is difficult. Whether wild animals have a role in transmission is an important question that, to date, has been virtually unexplored. To address this question, surveys of wild animals are urgently required in those areas in which Buruli ulcer is endemic.

TI  - Precipitation Controls on Soil Biogeochemical and Microbial Community Composition in Rainfed Agricultural Systems in Tropical Drylands
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The current and expected expansion of agriculture in the drylands of Mexico, together with the decrease in precipitation occurring in the country, likely affect ecosystem processes and will bring great challenges for the suitability of rainfed agriculture for smallholder farmers. Here, we assessed metrics of the soil C, N, and P cycles, as well as soil microbial diversity, under rainfed maize and common bean cropping in arid and semiarid regions of central Mexico. The soil enzymatic vector angles of cultivated plots in both regions were above 45 & DEG;, suggesting P limitation for microbial growth and crop productivity. Although changes were not observed in the intensity of this P-limitation with aridity, we found a negative effect of drought increase on the concentration of soil organic C and total N, with consequences for the C, N, and P balance in soils. Increasing aridity leads to the homogenization of microbial diversity. Considering a scenario in which decreases in mean annual precipitation would uncouple the biogeochemical cycles and homogenize soil biodiversity, the ecological implications could be an increase in the vulnerability of agricultural ecosystems to drought, with negative consequences for the suitability of rainfed agriculture in the drylands of central Mexico.

TI  - A comparative analysis of approaches for successional vegetation classification in the Brazilian Amazon
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Research on separation of successional stages has been an active topic for the past two decades because successional vegetation plays an important role in the carbon budget and restoration of soil fertility in the Brazilian Amazon. This article examines classification of successional stages by conducting a comparative analysis of classification algorithms (maximum likelihood classifier - MLC, artificial neural network - ANN, K-nearest neighbour - KNN, support vector machine - SVM, classification tree analysis - CTA, and object-based classification - OBC) on varying remote-sensing data-sets (Landsat and ALOS PALSAR). Through this research we obtained the following four major conclusions: (1) Landsat data provide higher classification accuracy than ALOS PALSAR data, and individual PALSAR data cannot effectively separate successional stages; (2) Fusion of Landsat and PALSAR data provides better classification than individual sensor data; (3) Depending on the data-set, the best classification algorithm varies, MLC and CTA are recommended for Landsat or fusion images; and KNN is recommended for the combination of Landsat and PALSAR data as extra bands; (4) the MLC based on fusion images is recommended for vegetation classification in the moist tropical region when sufficiently representative training samples are available.

TI  - Indirect Effects of Human Development Along the Coast on Coral Health
T2  - BIOTROPICA
AB  - Accelerated human development in coastal areas is causing declines in coral reefs worldwide, but the mechanisms by which development leads to reef degradation are often difficult to identify. Here, we use Akaike information criterion model averaging in combination with path analysis to test for the direct and indirect effects of potential environmental stressors on two coral diseases on the west coast of Hawai'i. We quantified human-altered land cover and human population density at two spatial scales: inland area of 1-km radius and watershed. We then tested for the effects of these land cover variables, as well as seawater chlorophyll concentrations, depth, host coral cover, and proximity to surface water discharge on the density of growth anomalies (GA) and prevalence of trematodiasis (TRE) affecting Porites lobata, the locally dominant reef-building coral species. Our analyses showed that human-altered land cover measured at 1-km scale was a strong indirect predictor of GA. Specifically, we found that human interference adjacent to the coast predicted higher chlorophyll concentrations, which in turn predicted higher GA density. We also found that chlorophyll and depth were strong negative predictors of TRE, and host coral cover a positive predictor. Our results indicated that GA are likely regulated by indirect land-based anthropogenic impacts, whereas TRE is mostly affected by host density-dependent forces. Path analysis can serve as a useful tool to rapidly identify the scale and indirect effects of anthropogenic stressors related to coral diseases, allowing for accurate conservation planning in the face of limited resources for tropical conservation.

TI  - Merozoite surface protein-1 genetic diversity in <i>Plasmodium malariae</i> and <i>Plasmodium brasilianum</i> from Brazil
T2  - BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB  - Background: The merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP1) gene encodes the major surface antigen of invasive forms of the Plasmodium erythrocytic stages and is considered a candidate vaccine antigen against malaria. Due to its polymorphisms, MSP1 is also useful for strain discrimination and consists of a good genetic marker. Sequence diversity in MSP1 has been analyzed in field isolates of three human parasites: P. falciparum, P. vivax, and P. ovale. However, the extent of variation in another human parasite, P. malariae, remains unknown. This parasite shows widespread, uneven distribution in tropical and subtropical regions throughout South America, Asia, and Africa. Interestingly, it is genetically indistinguishable from P. brasilianum, a parasite known to infect New World monkeys in Central and South America.
   Methods: Specific fragments (1 to 5) covering 60 % of the MSP1 gene (mainly the putatively polymorphic regions), were amplified by PCR in isolates of P. malariae and P. brasilianum from different geographic origin and hosts. Sequencing of the PCR-amplified products or cloned PCR fragments was performed and the sequences were used to construct a phylogenetic tree by the maximum likelihood method. Data were computed to give insights into the evolutionary and phylogenetic relationships of these parasites.
   Results: Except for fragment 4, sequences from all other fragments consisted of unpublished sequences. The most polymorphic gene region was fragment 2, and in samples where this region lacks polymorphism, all other regions are also identical. The low variability of the P. malariae msp1 sequences of these isolates and the identification of the same haplotype in those collected many years apart at different locations is compatible with a low transmission rate. We also found greater diversity among P. brasilianum isolates compared with P. malariae ones. Lastly, the sequences were segregated according to their geographic origins and hosts, showing a strong genetic and geographic structure.
   Conclusions: Our data show that there is a low level of sequence diversity and a possible absence of allelic dimorphism of MSP1 in these parasites as opposed to other Plasmodium species. P. brasilianum strains apparently show greater divergence in comparison to P. malariae, thus P. malariae could derive from P. brasilianum, as it has been proposed.

TI  - Mangrove plants and traditional Ayurvedic practitioners in Sundarbans region of West Bengal, India
T2  - RESEARCH ON CROPS
AB  - The Sundarbans is the world's largest delta and continuous mangrove forest, classified as moist tropical seral forest, comprising a mosaic of beach forest and tidal forest, located in Bangladesh and in the West Bengal, India. The Sundarbans has a population of over 4 million. The island based habitation within the Sundarbans faces various hindrances to normal daily life which forced the local habitants to develop their own unique way of living. In this situation, very long time back, local people have identified the medicinal properties of the mangrove plants. They have used different mangrove plants in different forms as medicine to cure some common as well as chronic ailments like fever, malaria, cold and cough, bronchitis, asthma, skin diseases, ulcers, leprosy, small pox, diarrhoea, dysentery, diabetes, infertility, etc. In our study, we have tried to document the medicinal uses of Sundarbans mangrove plants by collecting data from local people with special emphasis to the traditional ayurvedic practitioners (Vaidya, Gunin, Ojha, Baule, etc.). Altogether 35 mangrove species having medicinal values were recorded among which 23 trees, seven shrubs, three herbs, one semi-deciduous tree and one woody climbing shrub under 20 botanical families which were used to cure ailments commonly by the local healers.

TI  - Expression of resistance and tolerance of cassava genotypes to bacterial blight determined by genotype x environment interactions
T2  - JOURNAL OF PLANT DISEASES AND PROTECTION
AB  - The interaction of twenty-two cassava genotypes with Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. manihotis, the causal agent of bacterial blight, was evaluated under field conditions in three different sites, in the forest, forest savanna transition and wet savanna zones of Togo. Although no genotype with disease resistance in all sites was found due to high genotype x environment interactions, genotypes with promising levels of tolerance were identified. Cassava bacterial blight severity was negatively correlated to cassava root yield in artificially inoculated plots in the forest zone in two years, and in non-inoculated plots in the forest savanna transition zone and the wet savanna zone in the first and the second year, respectively. Evaluating symptom development, four genotypes (CVTM4, Main27, TMS30572, TMS92/0429) were resistant in at least one environment and moderately resistant in other environments, while three genotypes (Lagos, Toma289, Toma378) were over all susceptible. Combining symptom and yield data, seven genotypes (TMS92/0057, TMS29/0326, Cameroon, TMS92/0343, Ben86052, Lagos, Gbazekoute) were identified as tolerant. Due to high interaction with the environment and tolerance reactions of some genotypes, a prediction of yield loss due to bacterial blight and the determination of a threshold for loss seems hardly possible.

TI  - Significant heterogeneity in <i>Wolbachia</i> copy number within and between populations of <i>Onchocerca volvulus</i>
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
AB  - Background: Wolbachia are intracellular bacteria found in arthropods and several filarial nematode species. The filarial Wolbachia have been proposed to be involved in the immunopathology associated with onchocerciasis. Higher Wolbachia-to-nematode ratios have been reported in the savannah-ecotype compared to the forest-ecotype, and have been interpreted as consistent with a correlation between Wolbachia density and disease severity. However, factors such as geographic stratification and ivermectin drug exposure can lead to significant genetic heterogeneity in the nematode host populations, so we investigated whether Wolbachia copy number variation is also associated with these underlying factors.
   Methods: Genomic DNA was prepared from single adult nematodes representing forest and savannah ecotypes sampled from Togo, Ghana, Cte d'Ivoire and Mali. A qPCR assay was developed to measure the number of Wolbachia genome(s) per nematode genome. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) was also used to measure relative Wolbachia copy number, and independently verify the qPCR assay.
   Results: Significant variation was observed within the forest (range: 0.02 to 452.99; median: 10.58) and savannah (range: 0.01 to 1106.25; median: 9.10) ecotypes, however, no significant difference between ecotypes (P = 0.645) was observed; rather, strongly significant Wolbachia variation was observed within and between the nine study communities analysed (P = 0.021), independent of ecotype. Analysis of ivermectin-treated and untreated nematodes by qPCR showed no correlation (P = 0.869); however, an additional analysis of a subset of the nematodes by qPCR and NGS revealed a correlation between response to ivermectin treatment and Wolbachia copy number (P = 0.020).
   Conclusions: This study demonstrates that extensive within and between population variation exists in the Wolbachia content of individual adult O. volvulus. The origin and functional significance of such variation (up to similar to 100,000-fold between worms; similar to 10 to 100-fold between communities) in the context of the proposed mutualistic relationship between the worms and the bacteria, and between the presence of Wolbachia and clinical outcome of infection, remains unclear. These data do not support a correlation between Wolbachia copy number and forest or savannah ecotype, and may have implications for the development of anti-Wolbachia drugs as a macrofilaricidal treatment of onchocerciasis. The biological significance of a correlation between variation in Wolbachia copy number and ivermectin response remains unexplained.

TI  - FP-MAP: an extensive library of fingerprint-based molecular activity prediction tools
T2  - FRONTIERS IN CHEMISTRY
AB  - Discovering new drugs for disease treatment is challenging, requiring a multidisciplinary effort as well as time, and resources. With a view to improving hit discovery and lead compound identification, machine learning (ML) approaches are being increasingly used in the decision-making process. Although a number of ML-based studies have been published, most studies only report fragments of the wider range of bioactivities wherein each model typically focuses on a particular disease. This study introduces FP-MAP, an extensive atlas of fingerprint-based prediction models that covers a diverse range of activities including neglected tropical diseases (caused by viral, bacterial and parasitic pathogens) as well as other targets implicated in diseases such as Alzheimer's. To arrive at the best predictive models, performance of & AP;4,000 classification/regression models were evaluated on different bioactivity data sets using 12 different molecular fingerprints. The best performing models that achieved test set AUC values of 0.62-0.99 have been integrated into an easy-to-use graphical user interface that can be downloaded from https://gitlab.com/vishsoft/fpmap.

TI  - Emergency medicine in Nepal: are we going the right way and fast enough?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB  - Nepal is a landlocked country with variable topography including the world's tallest mountains, tropical forests, and Gangetic plains. This topography leads to diverse healthcare needs, from tropical diseases in plains, to road traffic accidents in hills, and to disaster-related emergencies from floods and landslides during monsoon season and unpredictable earthquakes. Emergency medicine care is underdeveloped and is currently being provided by general practitioners. The capital city Kathmandu has a few tertiary healthcare centers with emergency medicine fellowship-trained general practitioners staffing them, but most of the hospitals outside of Kathmandu are staffed by minimally trained or untrained medical officers. Even though emergency medicine is recognized as a specialty, Nepal still does not have an emergency medicine residency training program. To improve emergency care in the country, the government of Nepal should be focused on facilitating the start of emergency medicine residency in Nepal.

TI  - Using ecological criteria to design plant collection strategies for drug discovery
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Tropical forests are one of the most diverse and endangered habitats on earth. They have also been portrayed as a source of future pharmaceuticals, yet finding useful compounds can be both scientifically and politically challenging. Increasingly, over the past decade, the potential value of medicinal compounds derived from plants, microorganisms, and animals has been proposed as a tangible benefit of biodiversity and therefore a basis for promoting its preservation. Ecological theories of plant defense can increase the probability of discovering compounds with activity in bioassays against human disease targets. In addition, conducting research in tropical countries with local scientists provides immediate and lasting benefits for the sustainable use of biodiversity. This new approach to drug discovery has been effective in identifying bioactive leads. It is both an important step towards understanding the medicinal value of biodiversity, and a practical way to link drug discovery with conservation.

TI  - <i>Phytophthora theobromicola</i> sp. nov.: A New Species Causing Black Pod Disease on Cacao in Brazil
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Black pod disease, caused by Phytophthora species, is among the main limiting factors of cacao (Theobroma cacao L.) production. High incidence levels of black pod disease have been reported in Brazil, being induced by Phytophthora capsici, Phytophthora citrophthora, Phytophthora heveae, and Phytophthora palmivora. To assess the diversity of Phytophthora species affecting cacao in Brazil, 40 new isolates were obtained from cacao pods exhibiting symptoms of black pod disease collected in different smallholder farms in 2017. Further, ten cacao-infecting isolates morphologically identified as P. citrophthora and P. palmivora were molecularly characterized. The genomic regions beta-tubulin, elongation factor 1 alpha, heat shock protein 90, and internal transcribed spacer, and the mitochondrially encoded cytochrome c oxidase I and II genes were PCR-amplified and Sanger-sequenced from the cacao-infecting Phytophthora isolates. The morphological characterization and evaluation of the mycelial growth rates for the Phytophthora isolates were performed in vitro. Based on the molecular analysis and morphological comparisons, 19 isolates were identified as P. palmivora (clade 4). Interestingly, 31 isolates grouped together in the phylogenetic tree and were placed apart from previously known species in Phytophthora clade 2. Therefore, these isolates are considered as a new species herein referred to as Phytophthora theobromicola sp. nov., which produced papillate, semipapillate, and persistent sporangia on simple sporangiophores. The P. palmivora isolates were identified as A1 mating type by pairing each isolate with known A1 and A2 tester strains of P. capsici, but no oogonia/antheridia were observed when P. theobromicola was paired with the different tester strains. The P. theobromicola and P. citrophthora isolates showed higher mycelial growth rates, when compared to P. palmivora, on different media at 10, 15, and 20 degrees C, but similar values were observed when grown on clarified CA media at 25 and 30 degrees C. The pathogenicity tests carried out on pods of four cacao clones (CCN51, PS1319, Cepec2004, and CP49) showed significant variability among the isolates of both Phytophthora species, with P. theobromicola inducing higher rates of necrotic lesion expansion, when compared to P. palmivora. Here, two Phytophthora species were found associated with black pod disease in the state of Bahia, Brazil, and the previously undescribed P. theobromicola seems to be prevalent in field conditions. This is the first report of P. theobromicola on T. cacao. Also, these findings are crucial to improve the disease control strategies, and for the development of cacao materials genetically resistant to Phytophthora.

TI  - Properties and diagnosis of Ebola virus
T2  - BULLETIN DE L ACADEMIE NATIONALE DE MEDECINE
AB  - Ebola virus belongs to the Filoviridae family and includes several species, including the Ebola Zaire virus, responsible for an initial outbreak of hemorrhagic fever in 1976 and the current epidemic of West Africa. Fruit bats of tropical forests are the likely reservoir of this enveloped RNA virus which, following the incidental infection of a human being, is efficiently transmitted from man to man. Ebola virus exhibits a wide cell and tissue tropism and causes a deleterious acute infection leading to severe sepsis burdened with a heavy mortality. During the acute phase, the virus is very abundant in biological fluids where it can temporarily retain its infectivity for several days after death. Virological diagnosis is done mainly by RT-PCR on a blood sample and needs to be practiced in high security conditions. The pathophysiology of the infection allows to consider curative treatments and vaccination which are urgently needed.

TI  - Peridomestic natural breeding sites of <i>Nyssomyia whitmani</i> (Antunes and Coutinho) in an endemic area of tegumentary leishmaniasis in northeastern Argentina
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Author summary Phlebotomines are the subject of much research because of the role of their females as the only proven natural vectors of Leishmania species, the parasitic protozoans that are the causative agents of the neglected tropical disease leishmaniasis. The lack of ecology knowledge of immature stages of this vector limits their prevention and control strategies. We identified the rural breeding environments of immature stages of Ny. whitmani, that is the vector of tegumentary leishmaniasis in the north of Misiones province, Argentina, and compared the environmental and structural characteristics of those sites. We also identified the season of greatest emergence and its relationship with adult abundance. These results open the possibility of experimental evaluation of environmental management practices for prevention and control of the immature stages through strategies different from the ones usually conducted for adults.
   The scarce information about breeding sites of phlebotomines limits our understanding of the epidemiology of tegumentary leishmaniasis. Identifying the breeding sites and seasons of immature stages of these vectors is essential to propose prevention and control strategies different from those targeting the adult stage. Here we identified the rural breeding environments of immature stages of Ny. whitmani, vector species of Leishmania braziliensis in the north of Misiones province, Argentina; then we determined and compared the environmental and structural characteristics of those sites. We also identified the season of greatest emergence and its relationship with adult abundance. During a first collection period, between 28 and 48 emergence traps were set continuously for 16 months in six environments of the farm peridomicile and domicile: below house, chicken shed, experimental chicken shed, forest edge, pigsty and under fruit tree. Traps were checked and rotated every 40 nights. A total of 146 newly emerged individuals were collected (93.8% of them were Ny. whitmani), totaling an effort of 23,040 emergence trap-nights. The most productive environments were chicken shed and below house, and the greatest emergence was recorded in spring and summer. During a second collection period, emergence traps and light traps for adult capture were placed in the chicken shed and below house environments of eight farms. Emergence traps were active continuously during spring, summer, and early autumn. Environmental and structural characteristics of each environment were recorded. A total of 84 newly emerged phlebotomines (92.9% Ny. whitmani; 72,144 emergence trap-nights) and 13,993 adult phlebotomines (147 light trap-nights) were recorded in the chicken shed and below house environments. A positive correlation was also observed between trap success of newly emerged phlebotomines and of adults after 120 days. A high spatial variability was observed in the emergence of Ny. whitmani, with the number of newly emerged individuals being highest in soils of chicken sheds with the highest number of chickens and closest to forest edge. Moreover, below house was found to be as important as chicken sheds as breeding sites of Ny. whitmani. Management of the number of chickens in sheds, soil moisture and pH, and the decision of where to localize the chicken sheds in relation to the houses and the forest edge, might contribute to reduce the risk of human vector exposure and transmission of Leishmania.

TI  - Buruli ulcer, a mycobacterial skin disease
T2  - HAUTARZT
AB  - Buruli ulcer is a chronic ulcerative skin disease caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans. It is the third most common mycobacterial disease in immunocompetent people and affects mainly children living in humid areas of the tropical rain forest. The mode of transmission is unknown. The microorganisms penetrate the skin via microinjuries. A few weeks after infection, a subcutaneous nodule develops, followed by necrosis of the subcutaneous fat and finally by a large dermal ulceration. Typical is the lack of an acute inflammatory response, likely due to an immunosuppressive toxin produced by M. ulcerans called mycolactone. The lesions mostly affect the limbs. Constitutional symptoms are normally absent. The only effective treatment consists of wide excision, often followed by skin grafts, Conservative measures are rarely successful. Buruli ulcer is characterized by low mortality and high morbidity. Early recognition and treatment are decisive for the complete cure and prevention of debilitating deformities.

TI  - Multisensor earth observations to characterize wetlands and malaria epidemiology in Ethiopia
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
AB  - Malaria is a major global public health problem, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. The spatial heterogeneity of malaria can be affected by factors such as hydrological processes, physiography, and land cover patterns. Tropical wetlands, for example, are important hydrological features that can serve as mosquito breeding habitats. Mapping and monitoring of wetlands using satellite remote sensing can thus help to target interventions aimed at reducing malaria transmission. The objective of this study was to map wetlands and other major land cover types in the Amhara region of Ethiopia and to analyze district-level associations of malaria and wetlands across the region. We evaluated three random forests classification models using remotely sensed topographic and spectral data based on Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) and Landsat TM/ETM1 imagery, respectively. The model that integrated data from both sensors yielded more accurate land cover classification than single-sensor models. The resulting map of wetlands and other major land cover classes had an overall accuracy of 93.5%. Topographic indices and subpixel level fractional cover indices contributed most strongly to the land cover classification. Further, we found strong spatial associations of percent area of wetlands with malaria cases at the district level across the dry, wet, and fall seasons. Overall, our study provided the most extensive map of wetlands for the Amhara region and documented spatiotemporal associations of wetlands and malaria risk at a broad regional level. These findings can assist public health personnel in developing strategies to effectively control and eliminate malaria in the region.

TI  - Efficacy of Artesunate/Amodiaquine in the Treatment of Uncomplicated Malaria among Children in Ghana
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - The declining efficacy of chloroquine in the early 2000s in Ghana led to its replacement with artesunate/amodiaquine (AS/AQ) combination as first-line drug for treating uncomplicated malaria in 2005. Since then efficacy studies have been ongoing in the country to provide continuous data on the efficacy of AS/AQ and other alternative antimalarials (artemether/lumefantrine and dihyroartemisinin/piperaquine combinations) introduced in 2008. In vivo AS/AQ efficacy studies were conducted between June and October 2014 among children aged 6 months to 14 years, in two sentinel sites representing the forest and coastal zones of the country. The 2009 World Health Organization protocol for monitoring antimalarial drug efficacy was used in these studies. The studies showed an overall cumulative polymerase chain reaction-corrected day 28 cure rate of 97.2% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 93.6-99.1): 97.7% (95% CI: 92.0-99.7) within the forest zone and 96.7% (95% CI: 90.7-99.3) within the coastal zone (P= 0.686). Prevalence of fever declined from 100% to < 4% after first day of treatment in both ecological zones. All children in the coastal zone had cleared parasites by day 2. Three children (3.2%) in the forest zone were parasitemic on day 2, whereas one child was parasitemic on day 3. Gametocytemia was absent in both zones after day 14, and mean hemoglobin concentration significantly increased from 10.3 g/dL (95% CI: 10.1-10.5) on day 0 to 11.8 g/dL (95% CI: 11.6-12.0) on day 28. We conclude that AS/AQ combination remains efficacious in the treatment of uncomplicated malaria in Ghana.

TI  - Chikungunya Virus Exposure Partially Cross-Protects against Mayaro Virus Infection in Mice
T2  - JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY
AB  - Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and Mayaro virus (MAYV) are closely related members of the Semliki Forest virus antigenic complex classified as belonging to the genus Alphavirus of the family Togaviridae. These viruses cause human disease, with sudden fever and joint inflammation that can persist for long periods. CHIKV is the causative agent of large outbreaks worldwide, and MAYV infection represents a growing public health concern in Latin America, causing sporadic cases and geographically limited outbreaks. Considering the relationship between CHIKV and MAYV, the present study aimed to evaluate if preexisting CHIKV immunity protects against MAYV infection. Immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice were intraperitoneally infected with CHIKV and, 4 weeks later, they were infected with MAYV in their hind paw. We observed that the preexistence of CHIKV immunity conferred partial cross-protection against secondary MAYV infection, reducing disease severity, tissue viral load, and histopathological scores. Interestingly, CHIKV antibodies from humans and mice showed low cross-neutralization to MAYV, but neutralizing activity significantly increased after secondary infection. Furthermore, depletion of adaptive immune cells (CD4(+) T, CD8(+) T, and CD19(+) B cells) did not alter the cross-protection phenotype, suggesting that distinct cell subsets or a combination of adaptive immune cells stimulated by CHIKV are responsible for the partial cross-protection against MAYV. The reduction of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), in animals secondarily infected by MAYV, suggests a role for innate immunity in cross-protection. Our findings shed light on how preexisting immunity to arthritogenic alphaviruses may affect secondary infection, which may further develop relevant influence in disease outcome and viral transmission.
   IMPORTANCE Mosquito-borne viruses have a worldwide impact, especially in tropical climates. Chikungunya virus has been present mostly in developing countries, causing millions of infections, while Mayaro virus, a close relative, has been limited to the Caribbean and tropical regions of Latin America. The potential emergence and spread of Mayaro virus to other high-risk areas have increased the scientific community's attention to an imminent worldwide epidemic. Here, we designed an experimental protocol of chikungunya and Mayaro virus mouse infection, which develops a measurable and quantifiable disease that allows us to make inferences about potential immunological effects during secondary virus infection. Our results demonstrate that previous chikungunya virus infection is able to reduce the severity of clinical outcomes during secondary Mayaro infection. We provide scientific understanding of immunological features during secondary infection with the closely related virus, thus assisting in better comprehending viral transmission and the pathological outcome of these diseases.

TI  - The Complex Epidemiological Relationship between Flooding Events and Human Outbreaks of Mosquito-Borne Diseases: A Scoping Review
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES
AB  - BACKGROUND: Climate change is expected to increase the frequency of flooding events. Although rainfall is highly correlated with mosquito-borne diseases (MBD) in humans, less research focuses on understanding the impact of flooding events on disease incidence. This lack of research presents a significant gap in climate change-driven disease forecasting.
   OBJECTIVES: We conducted a scoping review to assess the strength of evidence regarding the potential relationship between flooding and MBD and to determine knowledge gaps.
   METHODS: PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science were searched through 31 December 2020 and supplemented with review of citations in relevant publications. Studies on rainfall were included only if the operationalization allowed for distinction of unusually heavy rainfall events. Data were abstracted by disease (dengue, malaria, or other) and stratified by post-event timing of disease assessment. Studies that conducted statistical testing were summarized in detail.
   RESULTS: From 3,008 initial results, we included 131 relevant studies (dengue n = 45, malaria n = 61, other MBD n = 49). Dengue studies indicated short-term (<1 month) decreases and subsequent (1-4 month) increases in incidence. Malaria studies indicated post-event incidence increases, but the results were mixed, and the temporal pattern was less clear. Statistical evidence was limited for other MBD, though findings suggest that human outbreaks of Murray Valley encephalitis, Ross River virus, Barmah Forest virus, Rift Valley fever, and Japanese encephalitis may follow flooding.
   DISCUSSION: Flooding is generally associated with increased incidence of MBD, potentially following a brief decrease in incidence for some diseases. Methodological inconsistencies significantly limit direct comparison and generalizability of study results. Regions with established MBD and weather surveillance should be leveraged to conduct multisite research to a) standardize the quantification of relevant flooding, b) study nonlinear relationships between rainfall and disease, c) report outcomes at multiple lag periods, and d) investigate interacting factors that modify the likelihood and severity of outbreaks across different settings.

TI  - Diversity, Co-Occurrence, and Nestedness Patterns of Sand Fly Species (Diptera: Psychodidae) in Two Rural Areas of Western Panama
T2  - INSECTS
AB  - Simple Summary
   Sand flies are insects that can transmit the parasites causing leishmaniasis, a major neglected tropical disease. In the Americas, these insects are highly diverse, and unlike what is observed for other vector-borne diseases, many species co-occur in sites where this disease affects human populations. Here, we present results from a two-year-long study where we study how the number of species changes in two rural areas of Western Panama with different land use cover and through the dry and wet seasons. We found that species number increased during the wet season and in plots with higher natural forest cover and that species number decreased in both areas in plots when the forest cover decreased, with some species changing through the seasons, and some species disappearing when comparing the sand fly faunas of the most forested with less forested plots. However, our results suggest that seasonality, or the change from a dry to rainy season, can be a more important driver of the number of species locally observed in the studied areas.
   Cutaneous Leishmaniasis transmission in the New World is observed in areas with rich sand fly species' faunas. The diversity and composition of sand fly species can change in response to seasonal weather and land use changes. Here, we present results from a two-year-long study where we collected, using Centers for Disease Control (CDC) light traps, sand flies from two rural areas, Las Pavas (LP) and Trinidad de las Minas (T) in western Panama. Over 710 trap-nights, we collected 16,156 sand flies from 15 genera and 35 species. We identified 34 species in T, and the most abundant species collected was Nyssomyia trapidoi (Fairchild and Hertig, 1952) (n = 2278, 37%), followed by Psychodopygus panamensis (Shannon, 1926) (n = 1112, 18%), and Trichopygomyia triramula (Fairchild and Hertig, 1952) (n = 1063, 17%). In LP, we identified 26 species, and the most abundant species collected were Ty. triramula (n = 4729, 48%), and Ps. panamensis (n = 3444, 35%). We estimated a higher species' richness in T (Chao2 +/- S.E.: 36.58 +/- 3.84) than in LP (27.49 +/- 2.28). In T, species' richness was significantly higher in the rainy season, but no seasonal differences were observed in LP. Species' assemblages were nested in the two areas. Phlebotomine sand fly species' abundance increased at the two sites during the rainy season. Our data suggest that seasonality is more important than land use as a factor driving sand fly species' diversity at the studied sites.

TI  - Evaluation of captured rainwater and irrigation runoff for greenhouse foliage and bedding plant production
T2  - HORTSCIENCE
AB  - Irrigation runoff water from a containerized landscape plant production bed was blended with rainwater from greenhouse roofs in a constructed collection basin. Water from both the collection basin and an on-site potable well were characterized and used to grow foliage and bedding plants with overhead and ebb-and-flow irrigation systems. Over a 2-year period, a total of 18 foliage and 8 bedding plant cultivars were produced with plant growth and quality quantified. Alkalinity, electrical conductivity, hardness, and concentrations of nutrients of water from both sources were well within desired levels for greenhouse crop production. Turbidity and pH were relatively high from algal growth in the collection basin. However, substrate pH, irrigated by either water source, remained between 6 and 7 throughout the production periods. All plants at the time of finishing were of marketable sizes and salable quality independent of water source. No disease incidences or growth disorders related to water sources were observed. Results suggest that captured irrigation runoff blended with rainwater can be an alternative water source for greenhouse crop production.

TI  - Deep Neural Networks Predict Inhibitors of <i>Schistosoma Mansoni</i> Thioredoxin Glutathione Reductase (SmTGR)
T2  - JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL BIOPHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY
AB  - Over 200 million people worldwide are affected annually by schistosomiasis with debilitating socio-economic effects. Praziquantel remains the main chemotherapy against this neglected tropical disease but there are reports of drug resistance. Therefore, necessitating the need to identify potential biotherapeutic molecules. The study describes the first deep learning (DL)-based computational models for predicting inhibitors of Schistosoma mansoni Thioredoxin glutathione reductase (SmTGR), which is an essential protein for the survival of the helminths in the host. The state-of-the-art performance of DL in similar applications makes it ideal to deploy on bioactive datasets of the SmTGR drug target. Cost-sensitive deep neural network classifiers were trained using the binary classification approach. Based on the area under curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) Curve scores (86.3-86.5%), the five best models generated were able to classify inhibitors with high accuracy (85-90%). Additionally, the DL classifier outperformed random forest by far. This is a proof of concept that deep neural networks can efficiently and robustly classify active schistosomal molecules from inactive. The generated models could be used to screen large-scale compound libraries to prioritize potential inhibitors for experimental characterization.
   The study developed cost-sensitive deep neural network (DNN) classifiers for predicting anti-schistosomal molecules. This is a plausible proof of concept since the DNNs outperformed other models including random forest. The DNNs can be deployed to screen large-scale compound libraries to identify potential biotherapeutic entities against thioredoxin glutathione reductase.

TI  - Climate change and finger millet: Perception, trend and impact on yield in different ecological regions in Central Nepal
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
AB  - The views of local people on climate change along different ecological regions are relatively unexplored in Nepal. This study was conducted in 13 villages in central Nepal at different altitudes to document the views of small holder farmers and compare their perception with trends of climatic variables, finger millet yield, natural disasters, plant phenology (flowering and fruiting), status of forest and wild life, as well as the spread of diseases and pests. Analysis on the climatic data of stations for 36-41 years between 1975 and 2016 showed significant increases in the minimum temperature in lower tropical climatic region (<500 m), upper tropical to subtropical climatic region (500-2000 m) and temperate climatic region (2000-3000 m) by 0.01, 0.026 and 0.054 degrees C/year, respectively, and an increase of maximum temperature by 0.008, 0.018, and 0.019 degrees C/year, respectively. Rainfall showed a strongly significant decreasing trend in all elevation regions. This result matches with the views of respondents except 38% respondent from temperate climatic region. People from the temperate climatic region also mentioned that current onset of snowfall is delayed but amount of snowfall remained the same. From the documented records, except events of wild fire, frequency of natural disasters events have increased in the recent years, which was in harmony with the views of local people. Multi-linear regression analysis showed that contribution of climatic variables on finger millet yield in lower tropical climatic region and upper tropical to subtropical regions was 23% and 57.3%, respectively, which was supported by increasing trend on average growing degree day (GDD) temperature at the rate of 0.01 degrees C in upper tropical to subtropical region and 0.007 degrees C in lower tropical climatic region yearly. Finger millet yield has been increasing at the rate of 7.39 and 36.9 kg/ha yearly in lower tropical climatic region and upper tropical to subtropical climatic region, respectively. This result provides deeper understanding of people's perception of causes and effects of climate change on diverse variables along different elevation and related magnitude which can contribute to policy making in Nepal.

TI  - Combined sewage overflow accelerates immature development and increases body size in the urban mosquito <i>Culex quinquefasciatus</i>
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - In urban landscapes the crowding of humans and their waste products may alleviate intra-specific interactions of common mosquitoes. Here, we present the results of a semi-natural experiment addressing the effects of water from a sewage overflow stream on density dependent fitness components and phenotypic traits of a common tropical and subtropical urban mosquito, Culex quinquefasciatus Say (Diptera: Culicidae). This semi-natural experiment was designed to quantify the relative importance of density dependence, weather forces and water quality on larval mortality, sex ratio and size at adult emergence. Results showed that mortality hazards were independent of larval density, decreased in sewage overflow water and increased with minimum temperatures. Under all rearing conditions adult mosquito size decreased with density. Mosquitoes from sewage overflow water emerged faster, were bigger and had an increased ratio of females to males. All these traits may contribute to the regulation of mosquito populations.

TI  - Physiological responses of seedlings to the invasion of brown root rot hyphae differ between semi-deciduous <i>Bischofia javanica</i> Blume and evergreen <i>Rhaphiolepis umbellata</i> (Thunb.) Makino
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PATHOLOGY
AB  - Brown root rot, caused by infection of the basidiomycete Phellinus noxius (Corner) G. Cunn., threatens many tree species in forests, orchards, and plantations of tropical regions. However, the precise physiological impairment of the trees with disease progression remains inadequately understood. Here, we chronicle the root decay, water relation, and physiological traits of leaves using artificially inoculated seedlings of two tree species of different leafing habits, semi-deciduous Bischofia javanica Blume and evergreen Rhaphiolepis umbellata (Thunb.) Makino. Stomatal closure seemed to be the primary reaction, without either species exhibiting a decrease in root hydraulic conductance associated with hyphae invasion or change in stem water potential. Compared with R. umbellata, B. javanica with highly sensitive stomatal response, alleviated the deterioration in carboxylation from hyphae invasion by thermal dissipation of excessive energy. These physiological responses were detected earlier than the appearance of visible disease symptoms. Although there were some differences in chlorophyll fluorescence (ChlF) response between the two species, our results have demonstrated that decreases in stomatal conductance and changes in ChlF, possibly depending on the species' leafing habit are some of the initial physiological responses of trees during the early phase of brown root rot infection.

TI  - Epidemiology and Molecular Relationships of <i>Cryptosporidium</i> spp. in People, Primates, and Livestock from Western Uganda
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background: Cryptosporidium is one of the most common parasitic diarrheal agents in the world and is a known zoonosis. We studied Cryptosporidium in people, livestock, and non-human primates in the region of Kibale National Park, Uganda. Land use change near the park has resulted in fragmented forest patches containing small, remnant populations of wild primates that interact intensively with local people and livestock. Our goal was to investigate risk factors for Cryptosporidium infection and to assess cross-species transmission using molecular methods.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Diagnostic PCR revealed a prevalence of Cryptosporidium of 32.4% in humans, 11.1% in non-human primates, and 2.2% in livestock. In the case of humans, residence in one particular community was associated with increased risk of infection, as was fetching water from an open water source. Although 48.5% of infected people reported gastrointestinal symptoms, this frequency was not significantly different in people who tested negative (44.7%) for Cryptosporidium, nor was co-infection with Giardia duodenalis associated with increased reporting of gastrointestinal symptoms. Fecal consistency was no different in infected versus uninfected people or animals. DNA sequences of the Cryptosporidium oocyst wall protein gene placed all infections within a well-supported C. parvum/C. hominis clade. However, the only two sequences recovered from primates in the core of the park's protected area fell into a divergent sub-clade and were identical to published sequences from C. parvum, C. hominis, and C. cuniculus, suggesting the possibility of a separate sylvatic transmission cycle.
   Conclusions/Significance: Cryptosporidium may be transmitted frequently among species in western Uganda where people, livestock, and wildlife interact intensively as a result of anthropogenic changes to forests, but the parasite may undergo more host-specific transmission where such interactions do not occur. The parasite does not appear to have strong effects on human or animal health, perhaps because of persistent low-level shedding and immunity.

TI  - Human Q Fever on the Guiana Shield and Brazil: Recent Findings and Remaining Questions
T2  - CURRENT TROPICAL MEDICINE REPORTS
AB  - Purpose of Review In this review, we report on the state of knowledge about human Q fever in Brazil and on the Guiana Shield, an Amazonian region located in northeastern South America. There is a contrast between French Guiana, where the incidence of this disease is the highest in the world, and other countries where this disease is practically non-existent. Recent Findings Recent findings are essentially in French Guiana where a unique strain MST17 has been identified; it is probably more virulent than those usually found with a particularly marked pulmonary tropism, a mysterious animal reservoir, a geographical distribution that raises questions. Q fever is a bacterial zoonosis due to Coxiella burnetii that has been reported worldwide. On the Guiana Shield, a region mostly covered by Amazonian forest, which encompasses the Venezuelan State of Bolivar, Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, and the Brazilian State of Amapa, the situation is very heterogeneous. While French Guiana is the region reporting the highest incidence of this disease in the world, with a single infecting clone (MST 117) and a unique epidemiological cycle, it has hardly ever been reported in other countries in the region. This absence of cases raises many questions and is probably due to massive under-diagnosis. Studies should estimate comprehensively the true burden of this disease in the region.

TI  - Ebola hemorrhagic fever outbreaks: strategies for effective epidemic management, containment and control
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB  - Ebola hemorrhagic fever, caused by the highly virulent RNA virus of the filoviridae family, has become one of the world's most feared pathogens. The virus induces acute fever and death, often associated with hemorrhagic symptoms in up to 90% of infected patients. The known sub-types of the virus are Zaire, Sudan, Tai Forest, Bundibugyo and Reston Ebola viruses. In the past, outbreaks were limited to the East and Central African tropical belt with the exception of Ebola Reston outbreaks that occurred in animal facilities in the Philippines, USA and Italy. The on-going outbreak in West Africa that is causing numerous deaths and severe socio-economic challenges has resulted in widespread anxiety globally. This panic may be attributed to the intense media interest, the rapid spread of the virus to other countries like United States and Spain, and moreover, to the absence of an approved treatment or vaccine.
   Informed by this widespread fear and anxiety, we analyzed the commonly used strategies to manage and control Ebola outbreaks and proposed new approaches that could improve epidemic management and control during future outbreaks. We based our recommendations on epidemic management practices employed during recent outbreaks in East, Central and West Africa, and synthesis of peer-reviewed publications as well as published "field" information from individuals and organizations recently involved in the management of Ebola epidemics.
   The current epidemic management approaches are largely "reactive", with containment efforts aimed at halting spread of existing outbreaks. We recommend that for better outcomes, in addition to "reactive" interventions, "pre-emptive" strategies also need to be instituted. We conclude that emphasizing both "reactive" and "pre-emptive" strategies is more likely to lead to better epidemic preparedness and response at individual, community, institutional, and government levels, resulting in timely containment of future Ebola outbreaks.

TI  - Modeling the efficacy of CRISPR gene drive for snail immunity on schistosomiasis control
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - CRISPR gene drives could revolutionize the control of infectious diseases by accelerating the spread of engineered traits that limit parasite transmission in wild populations. Gene drive technology in mollusks has received little attention despite the role of freshwater snails as hosts of parasitic flukes causing 200 million annual cases of schistosomiasis. A successful drive in snails must overcome self-fertilization, a common feature of host snails which could prevents a drive's spread. Here we developed a novel population genetic model accounting for snails' mixed mating and population dynamics, susceptibility to parasite infection regulated by multiple alleles, fitness differences between genotypes, and a range of drive characteristics. We integrated this model with an epidemiological model of schistosomiasis transmission to show that a snail population modification drive targeting immunity to infection can be hindered by a variety of biological and ecological factors; yet under a range of conditions, disease reduction achieved by chemotherapy treatment of the human population can be maintained with a drive. Alone a drive modifying snail immunity could achieve significant disease reduction in humans several years after release. These results indicate that gene drives, in coordination with existing public health measures, may become a useful tool to reduce schistosomiasis burden in selected transmission settings with effective CRISPR construct design and evaluation of the genetic and ecological landscape.

TI  - Environmental factors associated with American cutaneous leishmaniasis in a new Andean focus in Colombia
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE & INTERNATIONAL HEALTH
AB  - Objective To evaluate the environmental and ecological factors associated with Leishmania transmission and vector abundance in Chaparral, Tolima-Colombia. Methods First, we compared the ecological characteristics, abundance of phlebotomies and potential reservoir hosts in the peridomestic environment (100 m radius) of randomly selected houses, between two townships with high and low cutaneous leishmaniasis incidence. Second, we examined peridomestic correlates of phlebotomine abundance in all 43 houses in the higher risk township. Results The high transmission township had higher coverage of forest (23%vs. 8.4%) and shade coffee (30.7%vs. 11%), and less coffee monoculture (16.8%vs. 26.2%) and pasture (6.3%vs. 12.3%), compared to the low transmission township. Lutzomyia were more abundant in the high transmission township 2.5 vs. 0.2/trap/night. Lutzomyia longiflocosa was the most common species in both townships: 1021/1450 (70%) and 39/80 (49%). Numbers of potential wild mammal reservoirs were small, although four species were found to be infected with Leishmania (Viannia) spp. In the high transmission township, the overall peridomiciliary capture rate of L.similar to longiflocosa was 1.5/trap/night, and the abundance was higher in houses located nearer to forest (? = -0.30, P = 0.05). Conclusion The findings are consistent with a domestic transmission cycle with the phlebotomies dependent on dense vegetation near the house.

TI  - Climate Change and Tropical Andean Glacier Recession: Evaluating Hydrologic Changes and Livelihood Vulnerability in the Cordillera Blanca, Peru
T2  - ANNALS OF THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN GEOGRAPHERS
AB  - Climate change is forcing dramatic glacier mass loss in the Cordillera Blanca, Peru, resulting in hydrologic transformations across the Rio Santa watershed and increasing human vulnerability. This article presents results from two years of transdisciplinary collaborative research evaluating the complex relationships between coupled environmental and social change in the region. First, hydrologic results suggest there has been an average increase of 1.6 (+/-1.1) percent in the specific discharge of the more glacier-covered catchments (>20 percent glacier area) as a function of changes in stable isotopes of water (delta O-18 and delta H-2) from 2004 to 2006. Second, there is a large (mean 60 percent) component of groundwater in dry season discharge based on results from the hydrochemical basin characterization method. Third, findings from extensive key interviews and seventy-two randomly sampled household interviews within communities located in two case study watersheds demonstrate that a large majority of households perceive that glacier recession is proceeding very rapidly and that climate change-related impacts are affecting human vulnerability across multiple shifting vectors including access to water resources, agro-pastoral production, and weather variability.

TI  - The history of Chagas disease
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
AB  - The ancestor of Trypanosome cruzi was probably introduced to South American via bats approximately 7-10 million years ago. When the first humans arrived in the New World, a sylvatic cycle of Chagas disease was then already well established. Paleoparasitological data suggests that human American trypanosomiasis originated in the Andean area when people founded the first settlements in the coastal region of the Atacama Desert. Identification of T. cruzi as the etiological agent and triatome bugs as the transmission vector of Chagas disease occurred within a few years at the beginning of the 20th century. History also teaches us that human activity leading to environmental changes, in particular deforestation, is the main cause for the spread of Chagas disease. Recently, migration of T. cruzi-infected patients has led to a distribution of Chagas disease from Latin America to non-endemic countries in Europe, North America and western Pacific region.

TI  - <i>Terminalia laxiflora</i> and <i>Terminalia brownii</i> contain a broad spectrum of antimycobacterial compounds including ellagitannins, ellagic acid derivatives, triterpenes, fatty acids and fatty alcohols
T2  - JOURNAL OF ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY
AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Terminalia laxiflora Engl. & Diels, (Sudanese Arabic name: Darout j.ill) and Terminalia brownii Fresen (Sudanese Arabic name: Alshaf (Combretaceae) are used in Sudanese traditional folk medicine and in other African countries for treatment of infectious diseases, TB and its symptoms, such as cough, bronchitis and chest pain.
   Aim of study: Because of the frequent use of T. laxiflora and T. brownii in African traditional medicine and due to the absence of studies regarding their antimycobacterial potential there was a need to screen extracts of T. laxiflora and T. brownii for their growth inhibitory potential and to study the chemical composition and compounds in growth inhibitory extracts.
   Materials and methods: The plant species were collected in Sudan (Blue Nile Forest, Ed Damazin Forestry areas) and selected according to their uses in traditional medicine for the treatment of bacterial infections, including TB. Eighty extracts and fractions of the stem bark, stem wood, roots, leaves and fruits of T. laxifiora and T. brownii and nine pure compounds present in the active extracts were screened against Mycobacterium smegmatis ATCC 14468 using agar diffusion and microplate dilution methods. Inhibition zones and MIC values were estimated and compared to rifampicin. HPLC-UV/DAD, GC/MS and UHPLC/Q-TOF MS were employed to identify the compounds in the growth inhibitory extracts.
   Results: The roots of T. laxifiora and T. brownii gave the best antimycobacterial effects (IZ 22-27 mm) against Mycobacterium smegmatis. The lowest MIC of 625 mu g/ml was observed for an acetone extract of the root of T. laxiflora followed by methanol and ethyl acetate extracts, both giving MIC values of 1250 mu g/ml. Sephadex LH20 column chromatography purification of T. brownii roots resulted in low MIC values of 62.5 mu g/ml and 125 mu g/ml for acetone and ethanol fractions, respectively, compared to 5000 mu g/ml for the crude methanol extract. Methyl (S)-flavogallonate is suggested to be the main active compound in the Sephadex LH-20 acetone fraction, while ellagic acid xyloside and methyl ellagic acid xyloside are suggested to give good antimycobacterial activity in the Sephadex LH-20 ethanol fraction. RP-18 TLC purifications of an ethyl acetate extract of 7'. laxiflora roots resulted in the enrichment of punicalagin in one of the fractions (Fr5). This fraction gave a five times smaller MIC(500 mu g/ml) than the crude ethyl acetate extract (2500 mu g/ml) and this improved activity is suggested to be mostly due to punicalagin. 1,18-octadec-9-ene-dioate, stigmast-4-en-3-one, 5a-stigmastan-3,6-dione, triacontanol, sitostenone and fi-sitosterol were found in antimycobacterial hexane extracts of the stem bark of both studied species. Of these compounds, 1,18-octadec-9-ene-dioate, stigmast-4-en-3-one, 5a-stigmastan-3,6-dione, triacontanol, sitostenone have not been previously identified in T. brownii and T. laxiflora. Moreover, both plant species contained friedelin, betulinic acid, 13-amyrine and two unknown oleanane-type triterpenoids. Of the listed compounds, friedelin, triacontanol and sitostenone gave a MIC of 250 mu g/ml against M. smegmatis, whereas stigmasterol and fi-sitosterol gave MIC values of 500 mu g/ml.
   Conclusions: Our results show that T. laxiflora and T. brownii contain antimycobacterial compounds of diverse polarities and support the traditional uses of various parts of T. laxifiora and T.brownii as decoctions for treatment of tuberculosis. Further investigations are warranted to explore additional (new) antimycobacterial compounds in the active extracts of T. laxiflora and T. brownii.

TI  - Metabolite profiling and antiprotozoal activity of three endemic Iranian Helichrysum species
T2  - INDUSTRIAL CROPS AND PRODUCTS
AB  - Tropical diseases such as leishmaniosis constitute a major health concern in developing countries. Multiresistance of pathogens against classical antibiotics is a growing problem in treating infectious diseases. Thus, the search for new antibiotics is an urgent challenge. Helichrysum spp., mainly distributed in African countries, have been used in traditional and folk medicine for the treatment of several disorders including infectious diseases such as protozoal problems. In an ongoing project on the beneficial effects of Helichrysum spp., we aim to investigate and compare the anti-protozoal activities and phytochemical components of Helichrysum oligocephalum DC. and Helichrysum leucocephalum Ausfeld. Previously, we discovered pyrone and phloroglucinol derivatives as the active anti-protozoal components in Helichrysum oocephalum Boiss. [IC50 values 5.08 mu g/mL and 4.01 mu g/mL against Leishmania donovani and Plasmodium falciparum, respectively for dichloromethane (DCM) fraction]. As the former plants also showed similar activities to some extent [IC50 values 5.19 mu g/mL and 5.42 mu g/ mL against L. donovani and P. falciparum respectively for DCM fraction of H. oligocephalum, IC50 value 3.8 mu g/mL against P. falciparum for DCM fraction of H. leucocephalum], we decided to compare the metabolite profiles of those plants with H. oocephalum for dereplication purposes. A sensitive method coupling high-performance liquid chromatography with a photodiode-array detector (PDA) and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESIMS) was optimized for separation and metabolite profiling. The LC-ESIMS metabolite profiles of the fractions from the plants were compared by applying a two-step workflow using an ACD/MS workbook suite add-in, and data clustering on an open-source web platform freeclust. The metabolites were identified by NMR and LC-PDA-ESIMS techniques. The metabolites can be categorized into major types namely flavonoids, phenolic acids, pyrone, and phloroglucinol derivatives. Phloroglucinol derivatives were mainly present in DCM fractions. DCM extract of H. oligocephalum showed the most similar profile to our previously studied extract of H. oocephalum and seems to be even much richer in pyrone and phloroglucinol derivatives. The data could emphasize the potential of Helichrysum spp. for the treatment of infectious diseases. However, more studies on the other species around the world are needed to have a much better insight.

TI  - Risk of exposure to potential vector mosquitoes for rural workers in Northern Lao PDR
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   One major consequence of economic development in South-East Asia has been a rapid expansion of rubber plantations, in which outbreaks of dengue and malaria have occurred. Here we explored the difference in risk of exposure to potential dengue, Japanese encephalitis (JE), and malaria vectors between rubber workers and those engaged in traditional forest activities in northern Laos PDR.
   Methodology/Principal findings
   Adult mosquitoes were collected for nine months in secondary forests, mature and immature rubber plantations, and villages. Human behavior data were collected using rapid participatory rural appraisals and surveys. Exposure risk was assessed by combining vector and human behavior and calculating the basic reproduction number (R-0) in different typologies. Compared to those that stayed in the village, the risk of dengue vector exposure was higher for those that visited the secondary forests during the day (odds ratio (OR) 36.0), for those living and working in rubber plantations (OR 16.2) and for those that tapped rubber (OR 3.2). Exposure to JE vectors was also higher in the forest (OR 1.4) and, similar when working (OR 1.0) and living in the plantations (OR 0.8). Exposure to malaria vectors was greater in the forest (OR 1.3), similar when working in the plantations (OR 0.9) and lower when living in the plantations (OR 0.6). R-0 for dengue was >2.8 for all habitats surveyed, except villages where R-0 <= 0.06. The main malaria vector in all habitats was Anopheles maculatus s.l. in the rainy season and An. minimus s.l. in the dry season.
   Conclusions/Significance
   The highest risk of exposure to vector mosquitoes occurred when people visit natural forests. However, since rubber workers spend long periods in the rubber plantations, their risk of exposure is increased greatly compared to those who temporarily enter natural forests or remain in the village. This study highlights the necessity of broadening mosquito control to include rubber plantations.

TI  - Diversity of rickettsiae and potential vectors of spotted fever in an area of epidemiological interest in the Cerrado biome, midwestern Brazil
T2  - MEDICAL AND VETERINARY ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - The Brazilian state of Goias, untouched by spotted fever (SF) until 2012, has subsequently reported cases of the disease in several regions. This study aimed to survey the diversity of potential vectors and rickettsia in areas of Goias under environmental surveillance or case investigation for SF. Collected specimens were assayed with molecular biology technology using DNA extraction, amplification and sequencing of fragments of the genes gltA, ompA, ompB and sca4 to detect rickettsia in ticks and fleas. Amplification of cytochrome oxidase subunit II and 16S rRNA was performed to assist tick identification. Rickettsia felis (Rickettsiales: Rickettsiaceae) was found in Ctenocephalides felis (Bouche, 1835) (Siphonaptera: Pulicidae). Rickettsia bellii was found in Amblyomma rotundatum Koch, 1844 (Ixodida: Ixodidae) and in Amblyomma cajennense sensu lato. Rickettsia sp. strain NOD was found in Amblyomma nodosum Neumann, 1899. Of the Amblyomma cajennense complex, Amblyomma sculptum Berlese, 1888 was confirmed in the northern, northeast, midwest and southeast regions of Goias, whereas Amblyomma cajennense sensu stricto (Fabricius, 1787) was found only in the northern region of the state. Amblyomma dubitatum Neumann, 1899 associated with a species of the A. cajennense complex was the most common epidemiological finding, although Rickettsia rickettsii was not detected. This is the first report of Rickettsia sp. strain NOD in Goias.

TI  - Volunteer based approach to dog vaccination campaigns to eliminate human rabies: Lessons from Laikipia County, Kenya
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Author summary Given the importance of mass vaccinations of domestic dogs towards eliminating human rabies in Africa and the site-specific challenges facing such campaigns, additional studies on the development and implementation of such efforts are needed. One mechanism of mass vaccination lies in grassroots efforts that often begin at a very local scale and either develop into larger campaigns, remain local, or cease to persist past several years once interest and funding is exhausted. Here, we discuss the development of a grassroots campaign in Laikipia County, Kenya from its local inception to its development into a county-wide rabies elimination effort. Our results highlight challenges associated with achieving the targeted 70% coverage rate, including a need for consistent and systematic demographic monitoring of dog populations, limitations of the central point method, and logistical and financial challenges facing a volunteer-based effort. Serious political commitment from both the local and national governments are necessary to take the budget beyond what a crowdfunded campaign can raise, including availability and access to quality dog rabies vaccines. Without such outside support and substantial time to grow, grassroots campaigns might be better relegated to raising awareness and vaccinating dogs in small communities to protect those communities directly, without contributing to the broader ecosystem-wide transmission-stopping aim often sought by government human health and veterinary organizations.
   Background An estimated 59,000 people die from rabies annually, with 99% of those deaths attributable to bites from domestic dogs (Canis lupus familiaris). This preventable Neglected Tropical Disease has a large impact across continental Africa, especially for rural populations living in close contact with livestock and wildlife. Mass vaccinations of domestic dogs are effective at eliminating rabies but require large amounts of resources, planning, and political will to implement. Grassroots campaigns provide an alternative method to successful implementation of rabies control but remain understudied in their effectiveness to eliminate the disease from larger regions. Methodology/Principal Findings We report on the development, implementation, and effectiveness of a grassroots mass dog rabies vaccination campaign in Kenya, the Laikipia Rabies Vaccination Campaign. During 2015-2017, a total of 13,155 domestic dogs were vaccinated against rabies in 17 communities covering approximately 1500 km(2). Based on an estimated population size of 34,275 domestic dogs, percent coverages increased across years, from 2% in 2015 to 24% in 2017, with only 3 of 38 community-years of vaccination exceeding the 70% target. The average cost of vaccinating an animal was $3.44 USDwithin-kind contributions and $7.44 USDwithoutin-kind contributions. Conclusions/Significance The evolution of the Laikipia Rabies Vaccination Campaign from a localized volunteer-effort to a large-scale program attempting to eliminate rabies at the landscape scale provides a unique opportunity to examine successes, failures, and challenges facing grassroots campaigns. Success, in the form of vaccinating more dogs across the study area, was relatively straightforward to achieve. However, lack of effective post-vaccination monitoring and education programs, limited funding, and working in diverse community types appeared to hinder achievement of 70% coverage levels. These results indicate that grassroots campaigns will inevitably be faced with a philosophical question regarding the value of local impacts versus their contributions to a larger effort to eliminate rabies at the regional, country, or global scale.

TI  - Taxonomic mapping of Tabanidae (Diptera: Tabanidae) from Darjeeling Himalaya, a part of Indo-Burmese biodiversity hotspot
T2  - ORIENTAL INSECTS
AB  - The family Tabanidae includes horse flies (referred to flies of genus Tabanus), deer flies (Chrysops) and clegs (Haematopota). They are mainly popular in this tropical climate for their disease-causing abilities and one of those important disease that even may lead to fatal consequences in cattle animals is Surra disease that causes havoc in wild and livestocks in this region. A total of 22 tabanid species under 5 genera, 4 tribes and 3 subfamilies so far known from Darjeeling district of West Bengal, are keyed and diagnosed. Their distribution patterns are discussed wherever deemed necessary. Among them, single genus namely Hybomitra Enderlein, 1922 and four species are reported for the first time from this district and also from the state of West Bengal. Moreover, there is scope for taxonomic studies on this group of flies in this important biodiversity hot spot of northeastern Himalaya since it falls under diverse Indo-Malayan biome. Most of the species are however expected to exhibit extensive distribution pattern in the long run, as more extensive taxonomic and ecological studies are due on this interesting group of biting flies of veterinary importance.

TI  - A high-risk Zika and dengue transmission hub: virus detections in mosquitoes at a Brazilian university campus
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
AB  - Background: Zika virus (ZIKV) and dengue virus (DENV) are mosquito-borne flaviviruses prevalent throughout tropical regions. Currently, management of ZIKV and DENV centers on control of the primary vector Aedes aegypti. This vector is highly anthropophilic and is therefore prevalent throughout densely urbanised landscapes. A new passive trap for gravid Ae. aegypti (Gravid Aedes Trap - GAT) was developed for mosquito surveillance. Here the different killing agents and the level of transmission of arboviruses that may occur in mosquitoes sampled by GATs are assessed for the first time.
   Methods: Gravid Aedes traps (GATs) were deployed at the Federal University of Minas Gerais campus, in Belo Horizonte, Brazil to sample Ae. aegypti. Three different killing agents were evaluated within the GATs: sticky cards, long-lasting insecticide-impregnated nets (LLINs) and canola oil. Traps were monitored weekly for 14 weeks then mosquito specimens were identified to the species level and Ae. aegypti catches were pooled and submitted to qRT-PCR assays for to DENV and ZIKV virus detection, followed by Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of the ZIKV. Additionally, comparisons of means were performed on transformed weekly catch data (P = 0.05, t-tests) with the stats package of the R statistical software.
   Results: In total, 1506 female Ae. aegypti were captured using GATs, with traps using sticky cards catching more mosquito than those using either LLINs or canola oil. Both ZIKV and DENV were detected in Ae. aegypti females captured over several weeks suggesting that this highly populated university campus may have served as a significant transmission hub. The infection rate for ZIKV was present in seven (8.5%) pools from four weeks while DENV was detected in four (4.9%) pools from four weeks. Phylogenetic analysis of ZIKV classified the strain as Asian genotype.
   Conclusions: The Federal University of Minas Gerais and similar organizations must strongly consider monitoring Ae. aegypti populations and reinforcing personal protection of staff and students during seasons of high mosquito activity.

TI  - Ivermectin for the Treatment of Soil-Transmitted Helmithiases
T2  - CURRENT TREATMENT OPTIONS IN INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB  - Purpose of reviewTo present ivermectin as a transformational tool for the control of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) such as onchocerciasis and the drug of choice for the treatment of strongyloidiasis. Ivermectin is being re-discovered as a candidate drug for a variety of new indications among NTDs. In this review, new data are analyzed and put in context of current research interest as well as of the un-addressed issues for the treatment of soil-transmitted helminths (STH) infections.Recent findingsThe addition of ivermectin to the benzimidazole drugs appears as the most promising solution for three key issues for the WHO-guided strategy for STH control; these issues are the low efficacy of the current regimens against Trichuris trichiura, the risk of emergence of benzimidazole resistance, and the inclusion of Strongyloides stercoralis in the strategy. Pharmacokinetic aspects of ivermectin along with the large experience in the treatment of intestinal helminths in veterinary medicine also show potential research paths for better utilization of this drug for human infections.SummaryNew opportunities for the use of ivermectin in the control of STH as a public health problem are encouraging. However, this comes associated with new challenges not only of generating an adequate drug supply, but also for creating an access plan within a landscape of unresolved needs for the current indications.

TI  - Trends in ELISA-Based Flavivirus IgG Serosurveys: A Systematic Review
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE
AB  - Flaviviruses include virus species that are major public health threats worldwide. To determine the immunity landscape of these viruses, seroprevalence studies are often performed using IgG ELISA, which is a simple and rapid alternative to the virus neutralization test. In this review, we aim to describe the trends in flavivirus IgG ELISA-based serosurveys. A systematic literature review using six databases was performed to collate cohort and cross-sectional studies performed on the general population. A total of 204 studies were included in this review. The results show that most studies were performed on dengue virus (DENV), whereas Japanese Encephalitis Virus (JEV) was the least studied. For geographic distribution, serosurveys followed known disease prevalence. Temporally, the number of serosurveys increased after outbreaks and epidemics except for JEV, for which studies were performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of vaccination campaigns. Commercial kits were more commonly used than in-house assays for DENV, West Nile Virus (WNV), and Zika virus (ZIKV). Overall, most studies employed an indirect ELISA format, and the choice of antigens varied per virus. This review shows that flavivirus epidemiology is related to the regional and temporal distribution of serosurveys. It also highlights that endemicity, cross-reactivities, and kit availabilities affect assay choice in serosurveys.

TI  - First freshwater gastropod preserved in amber suggests long-distance dispersal during the Cretaceous Period
T2  - GEOLOGICAL MAGAZINE
AB  - Burmese amber continues to provide unique insights into the terrestrial biota inhabiting tropical equatorial forests during mid-Cretaceous time. In contrast to the large amount and great diversity of terrestrial species retrieved so far, aquatic biota constitute rare inclusions. Here we describe the first freshwater snail ever preserved in amber. The new species Galba prima sp. nov. belongs in the family Lymnaeidae, today a diverse and near globally distributed family. Its inclusion in terrestrial amber is probably a result of the amphibious lifestyle typical of modern representatives of the genus. The finding of a freshwater snail on the Burma Terrane, back then an island situated at some 1500 km from mainland Asia, has implications for the dispersal mechanisms of Mesozoic lymnaeids. The Cenomanian species precedes the evolution of waterfowl, which are today considered a main vector for long-distance dispersal. In their absence, we discuss several hypotheses to explain the disjunct occurrence of the new species.

TI  - CHANGING STRATEGIES IN NATURAL-PRODUCTS CHEMISTRY
T2  - PHYTOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Scientific strategies for the study of natural products from plants have changed substantially in the past few years for a number-of reasons, including advances in technology, new molecules of substantial interest, changing ethical principles for organism collection and heightened awareness of the chemical and biological potential of the tropical rain forests. This review reflects on these changes and discusses, with recent examples, how they have impacted the conduct of natural products chemistry.

TI  - Prevalence of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis in Districts of High and Low Endemicity in Mali
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Historically the western sahelian dry regions of Mali are known to be highly endemic for cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) caused by Leishmania major, while cases are rarely reported from the Southern savanna forest of the country. Here, we report baseline prevalence of CL infection in 3 ecologically distinct districts of Mali (dry sahelian, north savanna and southern savanna forest areas). We screened 195 to 250 subjects from 50 to 60 randomly selected households in each of the 6 villages (four from the western sahelian district of Diema in Kayes region, one from the central district of Kolokani and one from the southern savanna district of Kolodieba, region of Sikasso). The screening consisted of: 1] A Leishmanin Skin Test (LST) for detection of exposure to Leishmania parasites; 2] clinical examination of suspected lesions, followed by validation with PCR and 3] finger prick blood sample to determine antibody levels to sand fly saliva. LST positivity was higher in the western district of Diema (49.9%) than in Kolokani (24.9%) and was much lower in Kolondieba (2.6%). LST positivity increased with age rising from 13.8% to 88% in Diema for age groups 2-5 years and 41-65 years, respectively. All eight PCR-confirmed L. major CL cases were diagnosed in subjects below 18 years of age and all were residents of the district of Diema. Exposure to sand fly bites, measured by anti-saliva antibody titers, was comparable in individuals living in all three districts. However, antibody titers were significantly higher in LST positive individuals (P<0.0001). In conclusion, CL transmission remains active in the western region of Mali where lesions were mainly prevalent among children under 18 years old. LST positivity correlated to higher levels of antibodies to sand fly salivary proteins, suggesting their potential as a risk marker for CL acquisition in Mali.

TI  - Distribution of yellow fever vectors in Northwestern and Western Provinces, Zambia
T2  - ASIAN PACIFIC JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the distribution of yellow fever (YF) vectors species in Northwestern and Western of Zambia, which sampled mosquitoes inside and outside houses in rural, urban, peri-urban and forest areas.
   METHODS: Back-pack aspirators spray catches and CDC light traps collected adult mosquitoes including 405 Aedes, 518 Anopheles, 471 Culex and 71 Mansonia. Morphological vector identification and PCR viral determination were done at a WHO Regional Reference Centre (Institute Pasteur Dakar), Senegal.
   RESULTS: The two main YF vectors were Aedes (Stegomyia) aegypti (Ae. aegypti) and Aedes (Stegomyia) africanus. The first was collected in peri-urban areas and the later was in forest areas, both sparsely distributed in Northwestern Province, where the 0.43 Breteau and 1.92 container indexes, respectively implied low risk to YF. Aedes (Aedimorphus) mutilus; Aedes (Aedimorphus) minutus and Aedes (Finlaya) wellmani were also found in Northwestern, not in Western Province. No Aedes were collected from rural peri-domestic areas. Significantly more Aedes species (90.7%, n=398) than Anopheles (9.1%, n=40) were collected in forest areas (P<0.001) or Culex species (0.2%, n=2) (P<0.001). Ae. aegypti was found only in a discarded container but not in flower pots, old tyres, plant axils, discarded shallow wells, disused container bottles and canoes inspected.
   CONCLUSIONS: Ae. aegypti and Aedes africanus YF vectors were found in the study sites in the Northwestern Province of Zambia, where densities were low and distribution was sparse. The low Breteau index suggests low risk of YF in the Northwestern Province. The presence of Aedes in Northwestern Province and its absence in the Western Province could be due to differing ecological factors in the sampled areas. Universal coverage of vector control interventions could help to reduce YF vector population and the risk to arthropod-borne virus infections.

TI  - Molecular detection of Eastern Equine Encephalitis virus in mosquitoes from La Pintada (Antioquia)
T2  - REVISTA MVZ CORDOBA
AB  - Objective. The detection of emerging and re-emerging arboviruses in mosquitoes from urban and rural areas, is fundamental for predict possible epidemic outbreaks in human populations. The Municipality of La Pintada (Antioquia), is characterized by the presence of dry tropical forest relicts, fishing, tourism, farms and mining. An entomological research was performed for explore the possible circulation of arboviruses of public health importance. Materials and methods. Mosquitoes were captured in urban and rural sites in February-April of 2012. The specimens were stored in liquid nitrogens tanks and were grouped using taxonomic keys for genera. RNA extraction from pools and generic/nested RT-PCR was performed for Flavivirus, Alphavirus, Orthobunyavirus (Group Bunyamwera) and Phlebovirus. Results. 1274 mosquitoes were collected, mainly belonging to Culex and Aedes genera. RNA extracts of 64 pools were tested by RT-PCR and one pool was positive for Alphavirus. Sequencing of the RTPCR product and the analysis with sequences storage in GenBank designate the presence of Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV). Conclusions. This is the first record of natural infection from EEEV in mosquitoes from La Pintada (Antioquia), an area with ecological elements that favor the emergence of emerging and re-emerging arboviruses of medical and veterinarian importance.

TI  - SEROLOGIC EVIDENCE OF CANINE PARVOVIRUS IN DOMESTIC DOGS, WILD CARNIVORES, AND MARSUPIALS IN THE ARGENTINEAN CHACO
T2  - JOURNAL OF ZOO AND WILDLIFE MEDICINE
AB  - The transmission of pathogens between domestic dogs and generalist wildlife species may be modified by environmental degradation, biodiversity losses, host densities, and increased contact rates in remnant forest patches. A serologic survey of canine parvovirus (CPV) in rural domestic dogs and wild mammals was conducted in two neighboring rural areas (disturbed and protected) from Pampa del Indio, northeastern Argentina, between 2008 and 2011. A total of 174 domestic dogs and 26 wild mammals-4 crab-eating foxes (Cerdocyon thous), 3 crab-eating raccoons (Procyon cancrivorus), 17 white-eared opossums (Didelphis albiventris), and 2 gray four-eyed opossums (Philander opossum)-were examined for antibodies to CPV using a hemagglutination inhibition assay. Domestic dogs were numerous and their movements unrestricted. The main function of dogs differed significantly between areas, with more dogs used for herding or hunting around the protected area. The seroprevalence of antibodies to CPV in dogs from both areas was very high (93.9-94.6%) and increased steeply with age. Nearly all carnivores and marsupials showed high exposure to CPV. Although a higher exposure to CPV was expected in wild mammals from disturbed areas as a result of enhanced contact between dogs and wildlife, no significant differences were found between areas. To the authors' knowledge, this study is the first to document exposure to CPV of free-ranging Pr. cancrivorus, D. albiventris, and Ph. opossum, and include a detailed demographic study of the domestic dog populations living in the area. This study highlights that dogs and wildlife have potential opportunities for contact and shows that the edges of the protected area may be as suitable as other fragmented areas for the transmission of CPV. Rural domestic dogs may pose serious threats to the health and conservation of wild carnivores in both disturbed and protected areas, especially in the Gran Chaco, where habitat fragmentation is severely increasing.

TI  - Propolis: Its Role and Efficacy in Human Health and Diseases
T2  - MOLECULES
AB  - With technological advancements in the medicinal and pharmaceutical industries, numerous research studies have focused on the propolis produced by stingless bees (Meliponini tribe) and Apis mellifera honeybees as alternative complementary medicines for the potential treatment of various acute and chronic diseases. Propolis can be found in tropical and subtropical forests throughout the world. The composition of phytochemical constituents in propolis varies depending on the bee species, geographical location, botanical source, and environmental conditions. Typically, propolis contains lipid, beeswax, essential oils, pollen, and organic components. The latter include flavonoids, phenolic compounds, polyphenols, terpenes, terpenoids, coumarins, steroids, amino acids, and aromatic acids. The biologically active constituents of propolis, which include countless organic compounds such as artepillin C, caffeic acid, caffeic acid phenethyl ester, apigenin, chrysin, galangin, kaempferol, luteolin, genistein, naringin, pinocembrin, coumaric acid, and quercetin, have a broad spectrum of biological and therapeutic properties such as antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anticancer, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic obstruct pulmonary disorders, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory tract-related diseases, gastrointestinal disorders, as well as neuroprotective, immunomodulatory, and immuno-inflammatory agents. Therefore, this review aims to provide a summary of recent studies on the role of propolis, its constituents, its biologically active compounds, and their efficacy in the medicinal and pharmaceutical treatment of chronic diseases.

TI  - Identification of three members of the <i>Anopheles funestus</i> (Diptera: Culicidae) group and their role in malaria transmission in two ecological zones in Nigeria
T2  - TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - The role of the Anopheles funestus group in malaria transmission was investigated in two ecological zones in Nigeria. Sampling was carried out at four sites each around Ibadan (forest) and Ilorin (savanna). Human landing catches were supplemented with indoor and outdoor resting collections. PCR was used to identify 1848 A. funestus group mosquitoes to species level (749 in the savanna, 1099 in the forest) and three species were identified. In the forest, A. funestus s.s. predominated (55.4%), followed by A. rivulorum (27.6%) and A. leesoni (17.0%). Anopheles funestus was found mostly indoors. Anopheles rivulorum and A. leesoni predominated in outdoor collections (P < 0.001). Only Anopheles funestus s.s. was found in the savanna. ELISA analysis of 803 blood meal-positive specimens showed that over half of the blood meals were taken from humans in both ecotypes. The human blood index in A. funestus from the two study areas was similar. Anopheles funestus s.s. was the only species found positive for Plasmodium falciparum using ELISA, with overall infection rates of 2.3% and 1.0% in the forest and savanna respectively. The presence of three A. funestus species in Nigeria emphasizes the desirability of correct species identification within a malaria vector control programme.

TI  - Trans-Atlantic Spillover: Deconstructing the Ecological Adaptation of <i>Leishmania infantum</i> in the Americas
T2  - GENES
AB  - Pathogen fitness landscapes change when transmission cycles establish in non-native environments or spill over into new vectors and hosts. The introduction of Leishmania infantum in the Americas into the Neotropics during European colonization represents a unique case study to investigate the mechanisms of ecological adaptation of this important parasite. Defining the evolutionary trajectories that drive L. infantum fitness in this new environment are of great public health importance as they will allow unique insight into pathways of host/pathogen co-evolution and their consequences for region-specific changes in disease manifestation. This review summarizes current knowledge on L. infantum genetic and phenotypic diversity in the Americas and its possible role in the unique epidemiology of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in the New World. We highlight the importance of appreciating adaptive molecular mechanisms in L. infantum to understand the parasite's successful establishment on the continent.

TI  - Moving from control to elimination of schistosomiasis in sub-Saharan Africa: time to change and adapt strategies
T2  - INFECTIOUS DISEASES OF POVERTY
AB  - Schistosomiasis is a water borne parasitic disease of global importance and with ongoing control the disease endemic landscape is changing. In sub-Saharan Africa, for example, the landscape is becoming ever more heterogeneous as there are several species of Schistosoma that respond in different ways to ongoing preventive chemotherapy and the inter-sectoral interventions currently applied. The major focus of preventive chemotherapy is delivery of praziquantel by mass drug administration to those shown to be, or presumed to be, at-risk of infection and disease. In some countries, regional progress may be uneven but in certain locations there are very real prospects to transition from control into interruption of transmission, and ultimately elimination. To manage this transition requires reconsideration of some of the currently deployed diagnostic tools used in surveillance and downward realignment of existing prevalence thresholds to trigger mass treatment. A key challenge will be maintaining and if possible, expanding the current donation of praziquantel to currently overlooked groups, then judging when appropriate to move from mass drug administration to selective treatment. In so doing, this will ensure the health system is adapted, primed and shown to be cost-effective to respond to these changing disease dynamics as we move forward to 2020 targets and beyond.

TI  - Improved estimation of aboveground biomass in rubber plantations by fusing spectral and textural information from UAV-based RGB imagery
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
AB  - Aboveground biomass (AGB), as a crucial indicator of forest growth and quality, plays an important role in monitoring the global carbon cycle and forest health. Rapid, accurate, and non-destructive assessment of AGB in rubber plantations is beneficial not only for predicting rubber yield but also for understanding the carbon storage potential in tropical areas. Previous studies have employed spectral information and texture features derived from unmanned aerial vehicle data to estimate the AGB of mangroves. However, few studies systematically assessed the effects of grey level co-occurrence matrix parameters for extracting texture features on AGB esti-mation in rubber plantations. Whether the combination of spectral information and texture features with suitable grey level co-occurrence matrix parameters selection derived from a low-cost unmanned aerial vehicle system can improve the AGB estimation accuracy remains unclear. To this end, this study evaluated the performance of spectral information and texture features derived from UAV-based high-resolution RGB imagery with different textural parameter settings. Three types of machine learning algorithms (support vector regression; random forest; extreme gradient boosting regressor) and stepwise multiple linear regression were used to compare and analyze their performance for AGB estimation of rubber plantations. The results indicated that appropriate textural parameter selection significantly improved the AGB estimation accuracy when using texture features alone. Among four regression techniques, stepwise multiple linear regression exhibited poor performance, while support vector regression performed the best. The best estimation accuracy (R2 = 0.752, RMSE = 28.72 t/ha) was obtained by support vector regression when using the combination of spectral information and texture features with the textural parameters of the orientation of 135, displacement of 2 pixels, and moving window size parameter of 7 x 7 pixels. The findings suggested that the AGB estimation accuracy can be further improved by the integration of spectral information and texture features when considering appropriate textural parameters.

TI  - RECENT OBSERVATIONS ON THE EPIDEMIOLOGY OF KALA-AZAR IN THE EASTERN AND CENTRAL STATES OF THE SUDAN
T2  - TROPICAL AND GEOGRAPHICAL MEDICINE
AB  - The main endemic area of kala azar (visceral leishmaniasis) in the Sudan is in Eastern State and the Blue Nile area of Central State. In order to obtain more recent information about kala-azar in both States, the major hospitals and health centres were visited, the physicians and medical assistants interviewed and available records inspected. In Eastern State a cross sectional survey of one village was carried out and a longitudinal population based study of another village started. In this State, after a decline since 1985, a sharp increase in the number of cases was noted from 1991 onwards. This increase was seen in large areas, especially along the Rahad and Dinder Rivers. In contrast, in Central State, there was a decline in the frequency of the disease since the 1960s in the area around Sennar and Singa, which was regarded as a hyperendemic focus up to about 30 years ago. It was hypothesized that this decline may be related to the extensive agricultural development with regular insecticiding and the deforestation of the area. Several aspects with regard to transmission of kala-azar are discussed.

TI  - The role of land bridges, ancient environments, and migrations in the assembly of the North American flora
T2  - JOURNAL OF SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTION
AB  - Continental-scale assembly of floras results from past and present in situ diversification in association with several external processes. Among these processes are the making and breaking of connections among landmasses. Connections among landmasses are constantly in flux as are the climates and landscapes along the connection corridors, so that these corridors, or land bridges, may either facilitate or restrict migration at a given time. Across land bridges, changing landscape-level and organismal factors include the dispersal potential and vectors of propagules, competition, predation, and distributions altered by pathogens. Assembly of a flora is, therefore, the outcome of complex, interacting, temporally-varying factors that render simplistic explanations unlikely. In the case of North America, the continent experienced ephemeral connections with adjacent regions via five land bridges over the last 100 Ma at different times and under different climates and specific landscape morphologies, including edaphic characteristics. Here, I emphasize the earliest of these connections, Beringia, which probably comprised an initially-incomplete land bridge during the Cretaceous and Paleocene resulting from compression, fragmentation, and rotation of Asian-North American sub-blocks as North America began moving westward from the northern portion of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. During the same time, additional land was added to Beringia with accretion of terranes and the subduction of the northern edge of the Pacific Plate beneath the North American-Asian Plates in the Eocene to form the Aleutian Islands. Other connections between North America and adjacent landmasses were the North Atlantic, the Antilles, Central America, and the Magellan land bridge.

TI  - Light environment affects the levels of resistance hormones in <i>Syngonium</i> <i>podophyllum</i> leaves and its attack by herbivores
T2  - BOTANICAL SCIENCES
AB  - Background: Little is known on factors determining infection of tropical plants by fungal pathogens, although multiple studies on model species show that light conditions affect the two major hormones that control resistance in plants to enemies. This is the first study using a natural population of a wild tropical plant to relate light conditions to resistance hormones and, the beneficial and detrimental interactions with insects and fungi.
   Hypothesis: Light conditions affect the endogenous levels of resistance hormones and thereby cause quantitative shifts among herbivores and nectrotrophic, biotrophic and endophytic fungi.
   Studied species: The tropical vine Syngonium podophyllum.
   Study site: Los Tuxtlas tropical rain forest, Mexico.
   Methods: We used GC-MS to quantify the concentration of the two resistance hormones in intact leaves and natural levels of herbivory and fungal disease in S. podophyllum plants growing naturally in the full sun or in the shade.
   Results: The proportion of leaves damaged by herbivores or infected by hemibiotrophic or necrotrophic pathogens was higher in shade than under full-light conditions. Damage caused by biotrophic pathogens was frequently observed in sun but not in shade. Levels of both hormones in phenotypically healthy leaves were higher in sun than in shade.
   Conclusions: (i) light has an effect on concentrations of plant resistance hormones in nature; (ii) these differences have consequences for fungi and animals that naturally interact with the plant, and (iii) the described effect can represent a physiological mechanism via which an abiotic factor affects the members of the guilds at higher trophic levels.

TI  - Frequent House Invasion of <i>Trypanosoma cruzi</i>-Infected Triatomines in a Suburban Area of Brazil
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   The demographic transition of populations from rural areas to large urban centers often results in a disordered occupation of forest remnants and increased economic pressure to develop high-income buildings in these areas. Ecological and socioeconomic factors associated with these urban transitions create conditions for the potential transmission of infectious diseases, which was demonstrated for Chagas disease.
   Methodology/Principal Findings
   We analyzed 930 triatomines, mainly Triatoma tibiamaculata, collected in artificial and sylvatic environments (forests near houses) of a suburban area of the city of Salvador, Bahia State, Brazil between 2007 and 2011. Most triatomines were captured at peridomiciles. Adult bugs predominated in all studied environments, and nymphs were scarce inside houses. Molecular analyses of a randomly selected sub-sample (n=212) of triatomines showed Trypanosoma cruzi infection rates of 65%, 50% and 56% in intradomestic, peridomestic and sylvatic environments, respectively. We detected the T. cruzi lineages I and II and mixed infections. We also showed that T. tibiamaculata fed on blood from birds (50%), marsupials (38%), ruminants (7%) and rodents (5%). The probability of T. cruzi infection was higher in triatomines that fed on marsupial blood (odds ratio (OR)=1.95, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.22-3.11). Moreover, we observed a protective effect against infection in bugs that fed on bird blood (OR=0.43, 95% CI=0.30-0.73).
   Conclusions/Significance
   The frequent invasion of houses by infected triatomines indicates a potential risk of T. cruzi transmission to inhabitants in this area. Our results reinforce that continuous epidemiological surveillance should be performed in areas where domestic transmission is controlled but enzootic transmission persists.

AB  - Background: Schistosomiasis (S. mansoni and S. haematobium) is an important neglected tropical disease in sub-Saharan Africa including Ethiopia. In Ethiopia, Schistosomiasis has been prioritized as neglected tropical disease and remained among major public health burden on school age children of the country. Few studies conducted on the association between prevalence of Schistosomiasis and gender of school age children have inconclusive finding about the association between these two variables. Therefore, this systematic review and metaanalysis was done to determine the pooled prevalence of Schistosomiasis and its association with gender of school age children in Ethiopia.
   Methods: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, databases such as: Medline/PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Central library, Google Scholar, and HINARI were systematically searched. STATA version 14 was used to estimate pooled prevalence of Schistosomiasis using random effects model with 95% confidence interval. The results were presented by using forest plot and statistical heterogeneity was checked by using the Cochran Q test (chi-squared statistic), I-2 test statistic and by visual examination of the forest plot.
   Results: From the total of 427 studies identified for this review, 50 studies were included in the final analysis. The analysis noted that pooled prevalence of Schistosomiasis in Ethiopia was 28.78% (95% CI: 23.81, 33.74). The subgroup analysis indicated that extreme variability was observed in the prevalence of Schistosomiasis across the regions of the country. The highest (39.77%) prevalence of Schistosomiasis was reported from the southern region, whereas the lowest (14.95%) prevalence of Schistosomiasis was reported from Afar region. Male school age children were 58% more likely infected with Schistosomiasis than female school age children in Ethiopia (OR: 1.58, 95% CI: 133, 1.83).
   Conclusions: The Prevalence of Schistosomiasis was higher than the 2018 report of the Ethiopian federal ministry of health. The prevalence of Schistosomiasis was predominant among male gender of the school age children. Therefore, sustainable control of Schistosomiasis requires the approaches that must go beyond current deworming program. Complementary prevention strategies including health education, safe water and adequate sanitary facilities provision should be simultaneously implemented. The underlining causes of variation in risk factors of Schistosomiasis among males and females should be further studied. (C) 2021 The Authors.

TI  - Twenty-five years of progress in understanding pollination mechanisms in palms (Arecaceae)
T2  - ANNALS OF BOTANY
AB  - Background With more than 90 published studies of pollination mechanisms, the palm family is one of the better studied tropical families of angiosperms. Understanding palm-pollinator interactions has implications for tropical silviculture, agroforestry and horticulture, as well as for our understanding of palm evolution and diversification. We review the rich literature on pollination mechanisms in palms that has appeared since the last review of palm pollination studies was published 25 years ago.
   Scope and Conclusions Visitors to palm inflorescences are attracted by rewards such as food, shelter and oviposition sites. The interaction between the palm and its visiting fauna represents a trade-off between the services provided by the potential pollinators and the antagonistic activities of other insect visitors. Evidence suggests that beetles constitute the most important group of pollinators in palms, followed by bees and flies. Occasional pollinators include mammals (e.g. bats and marsupials) and even crabs. Comparative studies of palm-pollinator interactions in closely related palm species document transitions in floral morphology, phenology and anatomy correlated with shifts in pollination vectors. Synecological studies show that asynchronous flowering and partitioning of pollinator guilds may be important regulators of gene flow between closely related sympatric taxa and potential drivers of speciation processes. Studies of larger plant-pollinator networks point out the importance of competition for pollinators between palms and other flowering plants and document how the insect communities in tropical forest canopies probably influence the reproductive success of palms. However, published studies have a strong geographical bias towards the South American region and a taxonomic bias towards the tribe Cocoseae. Future studies should try to correct this imbalance to provide a more representative picture of pollination mechanisms and their evolutionary implications across the entire family.

TI  - LEISHMANICIDAL AND TRYPANOCIDAL ACTIVITIES OF BOLIVIAN MEDICINAL-PLANTS
T2  - JOURNAL OF ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY
AB  - Cutaneous and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis are endemic diseases in South America, especially in the subandean areas of the humid lowlands of Bolivia. Fourteen plants used topically in folk medicine to treat cutaneous leishmaniasis were collected in the tropical regions of colonization and in the rain forest occupied by Chimane Indians. Three of four plants used by the Chimane Indians exhibited an in vitro activity against three species of Leishmania. Two of ten plants used by the colonists showed an in vitro activity. We have also included results obtained with extracts from 53 Bolivian medicinal plants used for other diseases and from 43 plants collected with basis of chemotaxonomic criteria from all parts of Bolivia. All extracts were also screened in vitro against three strains of Trypanosoma cruzi (Trypanosomatidae), the causative agent of Chagas' disease.

TI  - Human Onchocerciasis: Modelling the Potential Long-term Consequences of a Vaccination Programme
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   Currently, the predominant onchocerciasis control strategy in Africa is annual mass drug administration (MDA) with ivermectin. However, there is a consensus among the global health community, supported by mathematical modelling, that onchocerciasis in Africa will not be eliminated within proposed time frameworks in all endemic foci with only annual MDA, and novel and alternative strategies are urgently needed. Furthermore, use of MDA with ivermectin is already compromised in large areas of central Africa co-endemic with Loa loa, and there are areas where suboptimal or atypical responses to ivermectin have been documented. An onchocerciasis vaccine would be highly advantageous in these areas.
   Methodology/Principal Findings
   We used a previously developed onchocerciasis transmission model (EPIONCHO) to investigate the impact of vaccination in areas where loiasis and onchocerciasis are co-endemic and ivermectin is contraindicated. We also explore the potential influence of a vaccination programme on infection resurgence in areas where local elimination has been successfully achieved. Based on the age range included in the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI), the vaccine was assumed to target 1 to 5 year olds. Our modelling results indicate that the deployment of an onchocerciasis vaccine would have a beneficial impact in onchocerciasis-loiasis co-endemic areas, markedly reducing microfilarial load in the young (under 20 yr) age groups.
   Conclusions/Significance
   An onchocerciasis prophylactic vaccine would reduce the onchocerciasis disease burden in populations where ivermectin cannot be administered safely. Moreover, a vaccine could substantially decrease the chance of re-emergence of Onchocerca volvulus infection in areas where it is deemed that MDA with ivermectin can be stopped. Therefore, a vaccine would protect the substantial investments made by present and past onchocerciasis control programmes, decreasing the chance of disease recrudescence and offering an important additional tool to mitigate the potentially devastating impact of emerging ivermectin resistance.

TI  - Odds, challenges and new approaches in the control of helminthiasis, an Asian study
T2  - PARASITE EPIDEMIOLOGY AND CONTROL
AB  - The time is passing, and the worms are still a major struggle for local people in Asian countries. especially the less empowered and in a situation of social vulnerability. We are working in the field in Laos, Thailand, and the Philippines where the usual control programs based only on human treatment are partially effective. Areas with mass drug administration could diminish, but not eliminate STHs of endemic areas. The persistence of helminthic NTDs in the environment and animal hosts makes the eradication a very difficult task. Great changes in the landscapes of endemic areas, such as construction of dams, can change the fauna and the lifestyle of local people. Those changes can improve infrastructure, but it can also lead to social vulnerability. The challenge, then, is to conceive new and directed control programs for helminthiasis based on multi- and transdisciplinary approaches diminishing the health gap in a globalized world. In this short review, we summarize the actual scenario concerning the main helminths in Southeast Asia and how an environmental DNA approach and the use of GIS could contribute to surveillance and control programs.

TI  - A compendium of small molecule direct-acting and host-targeting inhibitors as therapies against alphaviruses
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANTIMICROBIAL CHEMOTHERAPY
AB  - Alphaviruses were amongst the first arboviruses to be isolated, characterized and assigned a taxonomic status. They are globally widespread, infecting a large variety of terrestrial animals, birds, insects and even fish. Moreover, they are capable of surviving and circulating in both sylvatic and urban environments, causing considerable human morbidity and mortality. The re-emergence of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in almost every part of the world has caused alarm to many health agencies throughout the world. The mosquito vector for this virus, Aedes, is globally distributed in tropical and temperate regions and capable of thriving in both rural and urban landscapes, giving the opportunity for CHIKV to continue expanding into new geographical regions. Despite the importance of alphaviruses as human pathogens, there is currently no targeted antiviral treatment available for alphavirus infection. This mini-review discusses some of the major features in the replication cycle of alphaviruses, highlighting the key viral targets and host components that participate in alphavirus replication and the molecular functions that were used in drug design. Together with describing the importance of these targets, we review the various direct-acting and host-targeting inhibitors, specifically small molecules that have been discovered and developed as potential therapeutics as well as their reported in vitro and in vivo efficacies.

TI  - Chagas Disease Vector Control in a Hyperendemic Setting: The First 11 Years of Intervention in Cochabamba, Bolivia
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Author Summary
   Chagas disease is among the most serious public health problems in Latin America; the highest prevalence of infection by its causative agent, the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, has historically been recorded in some parts of Bolivia. In the early 2000s, a massive insecticide-spraying program was set up to control dwelling infestation by the blood-sucking bugs that transmit the disease. Here we provide a detailed assessment of the effects of this program in the Department of Cochabamba, one of the most highly-endemic settings worldwide. Our analyses show that municipality-level dwelling infestation rates plummeted from over 70-80% in 2001-2003 to about 2-3% in 2004-2011. This residual infestation was higher in the capital city and, more generally, in municipalities where montane dry forests dominate - probably because wild populations of the main vector, Triatoma infestans, are common in that eco-region. Despite the impressive early achievements of the program, with about 0.5 million people protected from contagion, sustained disease control will require fully operational long-term surveillance systems.
   Background
   Chagas disease has historically been hyperendemic in the Bolivian Department of Cochabamba. In the early 2000s, an extensive vector control program was implemented; 1.34 million dwelling inspections were conducted to ascertain infestation (2000-2001/2003-2011), with blanket insecticide spraying in 2003-2005 and subsequent survey-spraying cycles targeting residual infestation foci. Here, we assess the effects of this program on dwelling infestation rates (DIRs).
   Methodology/Principal Findings
   Program records were used to calculate annual, municipality-level aggregate DIRs (39 municipalities); very high values in 2000-2001 (median: 0.77-0.69) dropped to similar to 0.03 from 2004 on. A linear mixed model (with municipality as a random factor) suggested that infestation odds decreased, on average, by similar to 28% (95% confidence interval [CI95] 6-44%) with each 10-fold increase in control effort. A second, better-fitting mixed model including year as an ordinal predictor disclosed large DIR reductions in 2001-2003 (odds ratio [OR] 0.11, CI95 0.06-0.19) and 2003-2004 (OR 0.22, CI95 0.14-0.34). Except for a moderate decrease in 2005-2006, no significant changes were detected afterwards. In both models, municipality-level DIRs correlated positively with previous-year DIRs and with the extent of municipal territory originally covered by montane dry forests.
   Conclusions/Significance
   Insecticide-spraying campaigns had very strong, long-lasting effects on DIRs in Cochabamba. However, post-intervention surveys consistently detected infestation in similar to 3% of dwellings, underscoring the need for continuous surveillance; higher DIRs were recorded in the capital city and, more generally, in municipalities dominated by montane dry forest - an eco-region where wild Triatoma infestans are widespread. Traditional strategies combining insecticide spraying and longitudinal surveillance are thus confirmed as very effective means for area-wide Chagas disease vector control; they will be particularly beneficial in highly-endemic settings, but should also be implemented or maintained in other parts of Latin America where domestic infestation by triatomines is still commonplace.

TI  - Threats of soil erosion under CMIP6 SSPs scenarios: an integrated data mining techniques and geospatial approaches
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
AB  - Soil erosion-induced land degradation is susceptible to climate change, specifically in the sub-tropical third world countries. Simulations of 21st century climate change in India predict notable variation in rainfall that causes soil erosion-induced land degradation. Land degradation susceptibility modelling of the red and lateritic agro-climatic zone of Bengal (Eastern India) has been prepared using random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM) and extreme gradient boost (XGBoost) algorithms. Assessment of models using validation data in AUC-ROC revealed that XGBoost (0.909 and r = 0.91) is the most optimal followed by SVM (0.881 and r = 0.87) and RF (0.879 and r = 0.85). Furthermore, future land degradation risk dynamics were assessed through Coupled Model Intercomparison Project six (CMIP6) down-scale-based ensembles of nine global climate models (GCMs) on four SSPs scenarios. The combination of deep learning along with climate modelling should be useful to enhance the result more precisely.

TI  - Socio-economic, epidemiological and geographic features based on GIS-integrated mapping to identify malarial hotspots
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
AB  - Background: Malaria is a major health problem in the tropical and subtropical world. In India, 95% of the population resides in malaria endemic regions and it is major public health problem in most parts of the country. The present work has developed malaria maps by integrating socio-economic, epidemiology and geographical dimensions of three eastern districts of Uttar Pradesh, India. The area has been studied in each dimension separately, and later integrated to find a list of vulnerable pockets/villages, called as malarial hotspots.
   Methods: The study has been done at village level. Seasonal variation of malaria, comparison of epidemiology indices and progress of the medical facility were studied. Ten independent geographical information system (GIS) maps of socio-economic aspects (population, child population, literacy, and work force participation), epidemiology (annual parasitic index (API) and slides collected and examined) and geographical features (settlement, forest cover, water bodies, rainfall, relative humidity, and temperature) were drawn and studied. These maps were overlaid based on computed weight matrix to find malarial hotspot.
   Results: It was found that the studied dimensions were inter-weaving factors for malaria epidemic and closely affected malaria situations as evidenced from the obtained correlation matrix. The regions with water logging, high rainfall and proximity to forest, along with poor socio-economic conditions, are primarily hotspot regions. The work is presented through a series of GIS maps, tables, figures and graphs. A total of 2,054 out of 8,973 villages studied were found to be malarial hotspots and consequently suggestions were made to the concerned government malaria offices.
   Conclusion: With developing technology, information tools such as GIS, have captured almost every field of scientific research especially of vector-borne diseases, such as malaria. Malarial mapping enables easy update of information and effortless accessibility of geo-referenced data to policy makers to produce cost-effective measures for malaria control in endemic regions.

TI  - Poverty, Migration, and Chagas Disease
T2  - CURRENT TROPICAL MEDICINE REPORTS
AB  - Purpose of Review Chagas disease is among the most serious problems for public health in Latin America. Although the causative agent Trypanosoma cruzi and its triatomine insect vectors are widely distributed from the northern United States of America (USA) to southern Argentina, almost all human cases of infection are recorded from Latin American countries. The disease is associated to poorly constructed houses, in rural and periurban areas throughout Latin America, and to very low socioeconomic conditions. This article aims to review the different variables involved in the persistence of the different routes of transmission in endemic and non-endemic countries. Recent Findings Despite the efforts made by the governments of Latin American countries to control Chagas disease under the coordination of the World Health Organization (WHO)/Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), there are still extensive areas where vector transmission is present due to different causes: colonization fronts and land-use change, human migration, deforestation, mining and industrial crops, among others. In the same way, the increase in environmental temperature accelerates the speed of vector transmission. On the other hand, human migration to non-endemic countries in search of better living conditions has changed the panorama of distribution of Chagas disease globally. Globalization of Chagas disease has become a widespread public health and medical problem that requires to implement new prevention and control measures in non-endemic regions. The evidence shows that there are different factors involved in new epidemiological scenarios in endemic areas that require the implementation of strategies and policies to mitigate the transmission of the parasite to humans. Likewise, the implementation of health policies is required for the management and treatment of infected patients and to overcome barriers to access to available drugs.

TI  - BAT-BORNE RABIES IN LATIN AMERICA
T2  - REVISTA DO INSTITUTO DE MEDICINA TROPICAL DE SAO PAULO
AB  - The situation of rabies in America is complex: rabies in dogs has decreased dramatically, but bats are increasingly recognized as natural reservoirs of other rabies variants. Here, bat species known to be rabies-positive with different antigenic variants, are summarized in relation to bat conservation status across Latin America. Rabies virus is widespread in Latin American bat species, 22.5%(75) of bat species have been confirmed as rabies-positive. Most bat species found rabies positive are classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as "Least Concern". According to diet type, insectivorous bats had the most species known as rabies reservoirs, while in proportion hematophagous bats were the most important. Research at coarse spatial scales must strive to understand rabies ecology; basic information on distribution and population dynamics of many Latin American and Caribbean bat species is needed; and detailed information on effects of landscape change in driving bat- borne rabies outbreaks remains unassessed. Finally, integrated approaches including public health, ecology, and conservation biology are needed to understand and prevent emergent diseases in bats.

TI  - Isolation and characterization of pathogen defence-related class I chitinase from the actinorhizal tree Casuarina equisetifolia
T2  - FOREST PATHOLOGY
AB  - Casuarina equisetifolia has the widest distribution of all Casuarina species and is a nitrogen-fixing tree of considerable social, economic and environmental importance. Trichosporium vesiculosum, a causal agent of blister bark disease, is a serious pathogen of C. equisetifolia. In this study, a cDNA clone encoding class I chitinase (CeChi1) belonging to PR-3 family was cloned and characterized from the needle tissues of C. equisetifolia challenged with the toxic exudate of the fungal pathogen T. vesiculosum. The CeChi1 open reading frame comprised 966 nucleotides that encoded 321 amino acid residues with the molecular mass of mature protein being approximately 34 kDa. Analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence revealed the similarity of CeChi1 protein to class I chitinase from other plant species containing a hydrophobic signal peptide domain and hinge domain. The sequence also harboured a cysteine-rich chitin-binding domain and lysozyme-like domain. A hydrophobic C-terminal domain similar to the vacuole targeting sequences of class I chitinases isolated from other plants was also detected. The genomic sequence of CeChi1 indicated that the coding region contained three exons and two introns. In silico analysis of the untranslated regions revealed the presence of several cis-acting regulatory elements associated with hormonal regulation and stress responses. Quantitative real-time PCR analyses at different time points showed upregulation of the transcript during pathogen elicitation and salicylic acid signalling. However, no significant expression of CeChi1 was observed during other abiotic stress condition including wounding, water deficit, salt and heat stress revealing the specific expression of the gene during pathogenesis. This is the first report on isolation of a gene from C. equisetifolia, and the detailed functional analyses of CeChi1 will help in understanding its specific role in defence against pathogens in this tropical tree species.

TI  - Entomological profile of yellow fever epidemics in the Central African Republic, 2006-2010
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
AB  - Background: The causative agent of yellow fever is an arbovirus of the Flaviviridae family transmitted by infected Aedes mosquitoes, particularly in Africa. In the Central African Republic since 2006, cases have been notified in the provinces of Ombella-Mpoko, Ouham-Pende, Basse-Kotto, Haute-Kotto and in Bangui the capital. As the presence of a vector of yellow fever virus (YFV) represents a risk for spread of the disease, we undertook entomological investigations at these sites to identify potential vectors of YFV and their abundance.
   Findings: Between 2006 and 2010, 5066 mosquitoes belonging to six genera and 43 species were identified. The 20 species of the Aedes genus identified included Ae. aegypti, the main vector of YFV in urban settings, and species found in tropical forests, such as Ae. africanus, Ae. simpsoni, Ae. luteocephalus, Ae. vittatus and Ae. opok. These species were not distributed uniformly in the various sites studied. Thus, the predominant Aedes species was Ae. aegypti in Bangui (90.7 %) and Basse-Kotto (42.2 %), Ae. africanus in Ombella-Mpoko (67.4 %) and Haute-Kotto (77.8 %) and Ae. vittatus in Ouham-Pende (62.2 %). Ae. albopictus was also found in Bangui. The distribution of these dominant species differed significantly according to study site (P < 0.0001). None of the pooled homogenates of Aedes mosquitoes analysed by polymerase chain reaction contained the YFV genome.
   Conclusion: The results indicate a wide diversity of vector species for YFV in the Central African Republic. The establishment of surveillance and vector control programs should take into account the ecological specificity of each species.

TI  - A tale of 141 municipalities: the spatial distribution of dengue in Mato Grosso, Brazil
T2  - TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Background In recent years, the state of Mato Grosso has presented one of the highest dengue incidence rates in Brazil. The meeting of the Amazon, Cerrado and Pantanal biomes results in a large variation of rainfall and temperature across different regions of the state. In addition, Mato Grosso has been undergoing intense urban growth since the 1970s, mainly due to the colonization of the Mid-North and North regions. We analyzed factors involved in dengue incidence in Mato Grosso from 2008 to 2019.Methods The Moran Global Index was used to assess spatial autocorrelation of dengue incidence using explanatory variables such as temperature, precipitation, deforestation, population density and municipal development index. Areas at risk of dengue were grouped by the Local Moran Indicator.Results We noticed that areas at risk of dengue expanded from the Mid-North region to the North; the same pattern occurred from the Southeast to the Northeast; the South region remained at low-risk levels. The increase in incidence was influenced by precipitation, deforestation and the municipal development index.Conclusions The identification of risk areas for dengue in space and time enables public health authorities to focus their control and prevention efforts, reducing infestation and the potential impact of dengue in the human population.

TI  - Introduction of Mycobacterium ulcerans disease in the Bankim Health District of Cameroon follows damming of the Mape River
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Author summary Buruli ulcer is a destructive skin and soft tissue infection caused byMycobacterium ulcerans. Although the disease is not fatal, the infection can often leave patients with significant cosmetic and functional damage to limbs. Currently, one of the major hurdles facing Buruli ulcer control is our incomplete understanding of the factors leading to the emergence of disease in a particular region. In this report we investigate an anecdotal link between the damming of the Mape River in Cameroon and the emergence of Buruli ulcer in the Health Districts bordering the impoundment created by the Mape dam. We compare the genome sequences ofM.ulceransisolates recovered from regional Buruli ulcer patients that were identified in a previous molecular epidemiology study. Additionally, we investigate historic satellite imagery to quantify changes in land cover use that followed damming the river. The appearance of Buruli ulcer in the region was found to follow about ten years after the 1988 damming of the Mape River, supporting the idea that alterations to landscape hydrology can increase BU incidence. While this temporal association does not infer causation, this research helps define the ecological risk factors linked to the spread of BU.
   Buruli ulcer (BU) is an emerging ulcerative skin disease caused by infection withMycobacterium ulcerans. Efforts to control its spread have been hampered by our limited understanding ofM.ulceransreservoirs and transmission, and the factors leading to the emergence of BU disease in a particular region. In this report we investigate an anecdotal link between damming the Mape River in Cameroon and the emergence of BU in the Health Districts bordering Lake Bankim, the impoundment created by the Mape dam. We used bacterial population genomics and molecular dating to find compelling support for a 2000M.ulceransintroduction event that followed about 10 years after the filling of the newly created impoundment in 1988. We compared the genomic reconstructions with high-resolution satellite imagery to investigate what major environmental alterations might have driven the emergence of the new focus.

TI  - Environmental and socio-economic determinants associated with the occurrence of cutaneous leishmaniasis in the northeast of Colombia
T2  - TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Background: Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a vector-borne disease that is widely distributed in most tropical regions. Colombia has experienced an important increase in its incidence during the last decade. There are CL transmission foci in the Colombian departments of Santander and Norte de Santander.
   Objectives: To identify environmental and socio-economic variables associated with CL incidence in the municipalities of the northeast of Colombia between 2007 and 2016.
   Methods: This was an ecological study of CL cases aggregated by municipality. The cases reported during the study period were analyzed with a negative binomial regression to obtain the adjusted incident rate ratio for environmental and socio-economic variables.
   Findings: During the study period, 10 924 cases of CL were reported, and 110 (86.6%) municipalities reported at least one CL case. The coverages of forest (aIRR 1.05, 95% CI 1.03-1.07), heterogeneous agricultural zones (aIRR 1.04, 95% CI 1.02-1.06) and permanent crops (aIRR 1.07, 95% CI 1.02-1.12) were associated with a higher incidence of CL. Conversely, urban functionality (aIRR 0.95, 95% CI 0.92-0.96), minimal-altitude above sea level (aIRR 0.84, 95% CI 0.79-0.90) and shrub coverage (aIRR 0.98, 95% CI 0.95-1.0) were negatively associated with the incidence of CL in the municipality.
   Main conclusions: Our results confirm the importance of environmental determinants, such as height above sea level, and coverage of forest, permanent crops and heterogeneous agricultural zones, for the occurrence of CL; these findings also suggest the importance of shrub coverage. Furthermore, urban functionality was a socio-economic determinant independently associated with CL incidence.

TI  - Known and estimated distribution in Mexico of <i>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis,</i> a pathogenic fungus of amphibians
T2  - BIOTROPICA
AB  - Chytridiomycosis caused by fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) is one of the decline global causes of amphibians. Currently, it is distributed throughout a broad range of climates and ecosystems around the world. An epidemic wave of chytridiomycosis began in North America, resulting in population decline and local extinction of many species, reconfiguring species composition of amphibian communities in the Americas. In Mexico, Bd has caused an amphibian population decrease, and its potential distribution area has not been determined. We reviewed the number of species infected, obtaining Bd frequency of infection by land use and vegetation type, and by elevation range. We examined the known distribution of Bd, estimated the potential distribution, and obtained the bioclimate variables relevant for Bd. Our results indicate that in Mexico, Bd has been detected in 78 species of amphibians in 10 families, from 29 different land use and vegetation types, with cloud forest having the highest number of cases (139) and infected species (15). Bd occurs over an elevation range of 1-3,300 m asl and is most frequent at 1,200-1,500 m asl (36%). In addition to the regions previously described as suitable for Bd, our model included desert, coastal, and tropical forest regions, revealing an increase in the area where amphibians could be at risk of infection. Distribution of Bd is mainly associated with temperature of the wettest quarter and potential evapotranspiration of the warmer quarter. We offer an estimate of the ideal conditions for Bd in Mexico, also information for future studies on Bd and the conservation of amphibians. in Spanish is available with online material.

TI  - Biological Invasions of Geminiviruses: Case Study of TYLCV and <i>Bemisia tabaci</i> in Reunion Island
T2  - VIRUSES-BASEL
AB  - In the last 20 years, molecular ecology approaches have proven to be extremely useful to identify and assess factors associated with viral emerging diseases, particularly in economically and socially important tropical crops such as maize (maize streak disease) and cassava (cassava mosaic disease). Molecular ecology approaches were applied in Reunion Island to analyze the epidemic of tomato yellow leaf curl disease, which has been affecting the island since the end of the 1990s. Before the invasive biotype B (currently known as Middle East-Asia Minor 1 cryptic species) of Bemisia tabaci spread across the world, Reunion Island (South West Indian Ocean) only hosted an indigenous biotype of B. tabaci, Ms (currently known as Indian Ocean cryptic species). Wild hybrids between invasive and indigenous species were subsequently characterized over multiple generations. Endosymbiont analysis of the hybrid population indicated that matings were non-random. Similarly, while no indigenous begomoviruses have ever been reported on Reunion Island, the two main strains of one of the most damaging and emerging plant viruses in the world, the Mild and Israel strains of the Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV-Mld and TYLCV-IL), were introduced in 1997 and 2004 respectively. While these introductions extensively modified the agricultural landscape of Reunion Island, they also provided an invaluable opportunity to study the ecological and genetic mechanisms involved in biological invasion and competition.

TI  - Soil Salinity Mapping Using SAR Sentinel-1 Data and Advanced Machine Learning Algorithms: A Case Study at Ben Tre Province of the Mekong River Delta (Vietnam)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Soil salinity caused by climate change associated with rising sea level is considered as one of the most severe natural hazards that has a negative effect on agricultural activities in the coastal areas in most tropical climates. This issue has become more severe and increasingly occurred in the Mekong River Delta of Vietnam. The main objective of this work is to map soil salinity intrusion in Ben Tre province located on the Mekong River Delta of Vietnam using the Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) C-band data combined with five state-of-the-art machine learning models, Multilayer Perceptron Neural Networks (MLP-NN), Radial Basis Function Neural Networks (RBF-NN), Gaussian Processes (GP), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Random Forests (RF). For this purpose, 63 soil samples were collected during the field survey conducted from 4-6 April 2018 corresponding to the Sentinel-1 SAR imagery. The performance of the five models was assessed and compared using the root-mean-square error (RMSE), the mean absolute error (MAE), and the correlation coefficient (r). The results revealed that the GP model yielded the highest prediction performance (RMSE = 2.885, MAE = 1.897, and r = 0.808) and outperformed the other machine learning models. We conclude that the advanced machine learning models can be used for mapping soil salinity in the Delta areas; thus, providing a useful tool for assisting farmers and the policy maker in choosing better crop types in the context of climate change.

TI  - Geographic Distribution and Ecology of <i>Triatoma dimidiata</i> (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) in Colombia
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - Triatoma dimidiata Latreille is the second most important vector of Chagas' disease in Colombia and is found in urban and periurban areas. From January 2007 to June 2008, we performed field work in 8 departments, 18 municipalities, and 44 rural villages, covering most of its known distribution and all of its ecological zones in the country. The goal was to determine the geographical distribution, the ecology, and house infestation indices of T. dimidiata over its range and hence the Chagas' disease transmission risk. In Colombia, T. dimidiata occupies a wide variety of ecosystems, from transformed ecosystems in the Andean biome with shrub and xerofitic vegetation to very dense forests in the humid tropical forests in the Sierra Nevada of Santa Marta. According to genetic and ecological criteria, at least two T. dimidiata forms of this species are present: populations from the northwest of the country (Caribbean plains) are restricted to palm tree habitats, and domestic involvement is limited to sporadic visits because of attraction by light; and populations of the east region (Andean mountains) presenting a complex distributional pattern including sylvatic, peridomestic, and domiciliated ecotopes, and occupying a great variety of life zones. The latter population is of epidemiological importance due to the demonstrated migration and genetical flow of individuals among the different habitats. Control, therefore, must take into account its diversity of habitats.

TI  - Update on the distribution of <i>Mansonella</i> <i>perstans</i> in the southern part of Cameroon: influence of ecological factors and mass drug administration with ivermectin
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
AB  - Background: Mansonellosis remains one of the most neglected of tropical diseases and its current distribution in the entire forest block of southern Cameroon is unknown. In order to address this issue, we have surveyed the distribution of Mansonella perstans in different bioecological zones and in addition, elucidated the influence of multiple rounds of ivermectin (IVM) based mass drug administration (MDA).
   Methods: A mixed design was used. Between 2000 and 2014, both cross-sectional and longitudinal surveys were carried out in 137 communities selected from 12 health districts belonging to five main bioecological zones of the southern part of Cameroon. The zones comprised of grassland savanna (GS), mosaic forest savanna (MFS), forested savanna (FS), deciduous equatorial rainforest (DERF) and the dense humid equatorial rainforest (DHERF). The survey was carried out in some areas with no treatment history as well as those currently under IVM MDA. Individuals within the participatory communities were screened for the presence of M. perstans microfilariae (mf) in peripheral blood by the calibrated thick film method to determine both prevalence and geometric mean intensities at the community level.
   Results: Apart from sporadic cases in savanna areas, distribution of M. perstans was strongly linked to the equatorial rainforest zones. Before CDTI, the highest mean prevalence (70.0 %) and intensity (17,382.2 mf/ml) were obtained in communities in Mamfes' DHERF areas followed by communities in the DHERF zone of Lolodorf (53.8 % and 7,814.8 mf/ml, respectively). A longitudinal survey in Mamfe further showed that M. perstans infections had reduced by 34. 5 % in DERF (P < 0.001) but not DHERF zones after ten years of IVM MDA. Further data from the cross-sectional study revealed that there was a decrease in prevalence in DHERF zones only after ten years of MDA. In DERF zones however, the infection was relatively lower after four years of MDA.
   Conclusions: The distribution of M. perstans in the southern part of Cameroon varies with bioecological zones and IVM MDA history. The zones with high prevalence and intensities lie in forested areas while those with low endemicity are in the savanna areas. MDA with ivermectin induced significant reduction in the endemicity of mansonellosis in the decidious equatorial rainforest. In contrast, the prevalence and intensity remained relatively high and stable in the dense humid equatorial rainforest zones even after a decade of mass drug administration with ivermectin. Since it is known that M. perstans down-regulates host's immune system, the findings from this work would be useful in designing studies to understand the impact of M. perstans on host immune response to vaccination and co-infection with other pathogens such as Mycobacterium spp. and Plasmodium spp. in areas of contrasting endemicities.

TI  - Potential of ethno-veterinary medicine in animal health care practices in the South Pacific Island countries: a review
T2  - TROPICAL ANIMAL HEALTH AND PRODUCTION
AB  - The South Pacific island countries (SPIC) are among the most vulnerable countries in the world to economic shocks, climate change and natural disasters. Agriculture including livestock production makes important contribution to socio-economic development in the region. However, the livestock sector is marred by many livestock diseases, which are crippling the economies as well as threatening the food security of the island nations, most of which have high dependence on imports. Limited veterinary medical facilities, high cost of conventional medicine and remoteness of some rural farming communities make it difficult for farmers to treat their diseased animals. Nevertheless, the island nations are endowed with vast reserves of medicinal plants in diverse ecosystems including mangroves, rainforests and tropical dry forests. Despite the ubiquity of traditional medicine systems, most of the plant species have been used to treat human aliments in the SPIC and very few farmers utilise herbal medicine to treat their animals. This review highlights the common diseases affecting livestock production in the SPIC, threats to ethno-veterinary knowledge, and potential plant species and their efficacies to treat animal diseases and parasites. It also discusses the common methods of preparation of veterinary herbal medicine and possible ways of making the medicine available in the formal and informal markets in the region. It is envisaged that the review will stimulate further ethno-veterinary research among livestock disease management practices in the SPIC.

TI  - Intraspecific phylogeny of <i>Anopheles</i> (<i>Kerteszia</i>) <i>neivai</i> Howard, Dyar & Knab 1913, based on mitochondrial and nuclear ribosomal genes
T2  - INFECTION GENETICS AND EVOLUTION
AB  - Three mitochondrial regions and a fragment of a large nuclear ribosomal subunit was used to study the evolutionary patterns of An. neivai, a mosquito inhabiting mangroves and tropical forest in the lowland and coastal areas of the Yucatan Peninsula through the Pacific Ecuadorian coast. This species exhibits epidemiological importance regarding Malaria transmission in natural ecosystems, particularly in rural areas of the Pacific Colombian coast. The results based on phylogenetic networks and Bayesian inference showed no robust evidence supporting the existence of previously suggested cryptic species. Diversification patterns in geographically widespread species such as this one, are complex and therefore could impact malaria control strategies. Further studies focused on behavior, morphology, and phylogenomics will improve the understanding of the evolutionary patterns within An. neivai and its role as a disease vector.

TI  - High-quality seed dispersal by fruit-eating fishes in Amazonian floodplain habitats
T2  - OECOLOGIA
AB  - Seed dispersal is a critical stage in the life history of plants. It determines the initial pattern of juvenile distribution, and can influence community dynamics and the evolutionary trajectories of individual species. Vertebrate frugivores are the primary vector of seed dispersal in tropical forests; however, most studies of seed dispersal focus on birds, bats and monkeys. Nevertheless, South America harbors at least 200 species of frugivorous fishes, which move into temporarily flooded habitats during lengthy flood seasons and consume fruits that fall into the water; and yet, we know remarkably little about the quality of seed dispersal they effect. We investigated the seed dispersal activities of two species of large-bodied, commercially important fishes (Colossoma macropomum and Piaractus brachypomus, Characidae) over 3 years in Pacaya-Samiria National Reserve (Peru). We assessed the diet of these fishes during the flood season, conducted germination trials with seeds collected from digestive tracts, and quantified fruit availability. In the laboratory, we fed fruits to captive Colossoma, quantified the proportion of seeds defecated by adult and juvenile fish, and used these seeds in additional germination experiments. Our results indicate that Colossoma and Piaractus disperse large quantities of seeds from up to 35% of the trees and lianas that fruit during the flood season. Additionally, these seeds can germinate after floodwaters recede. Overexploitation has reduced the abundance of our focal fish species, as well as changed the age structure of populations. Moreover, older fish are more effective seed dispersers than smaller, juvenile fish. Overfishing, therefore, likely selects for the poorest seed dispersers, thus disrupting an ancient interaction between seeds and their dispersal agents.

TI  - Dynamics of wood in large rivers
T2  - ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT OF WOOD IN WORLD RIVERS
CP  - International Conference on Wood in World Rivers
AB  - A large river, in relation to wood dynamics, has a width several times greater than the height of the trees in its riparian area. Large rivers undergo particular physical and biological processes related to wood that vary according to their condition (pristine or managed) and their locations in the landscape (upland area or downstream, tropical or temperate climates).
   In this chapter, several topics are developed to illustrate how large wood plays a significant role in the functioning of large rivers: production and transfer of wood, interactions between wood and channel geometry (accumulation sites, trapping efficiency, effects of wood on channel forms), and interactions between wood and human activities and management (effects of wood on fish resources, damages associated with the wood, restoration and maintenance strategies).
   Bank erosion, wind, beavers, floodplain forest clearing by overbank flow, meteorological events (snow, wind), and humans (dump areas, residuals of timber harvest) are the main vectors of wood introduction to large rivers. The amount of wood stored in the channel is usually low compared to what is introduced annually. Wood is mainly located at the edge of the floodplain (islands, concave banks, side channels), but differences exist in accumulation sites, according to the channel pattern and geometry. The effects of wood on island formation as well as its effects on meander cut-off have been observed but are variable from one river to another according to the size of the wood and the character of the floodplain.
   Fish abundance and diversity are influenced by wood structures, even in rivers with low amounts of wood. Wood obstructions and their associated geomorphic facies provide rearing sites and habitats for aquatic invertebrates. Because the amount of wood in large rivers is usually low, it rarely increases flooding risks locally. Wood affects navigation where unobstructed channels are favored; wood transport has then a cost because it must be removed. When the wood in rivers is enhancing fish resources, there is a need to define a balance between the ecological benefit of the wood and the need for removing it for safety purposes. In the 1980s, research was focused on habitat questions at a local spatial scale, linking hydraulic and geomorphic conditions, and characters of fish species. A research priority is now necessary to understand wood mobility and its downstream impacts.

TI  - Social and technical considerations in establishing large-scale <i>Acacia</i> plantations on grassland and bushland in West Kalimantan, Indonesia
T2  - RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN ACACIA PLANTING
CP  - International Workshop on Recent Developments in Acacia Planting
AB  - Possibilities of establishing large-scale pulp plantations using tropical acacias are being tested in a humid tropical climate on heavily degraded Imperata grasslands and abandoned shifting cultivation areas in West Kalimantan, Indonesia. The ultimate aim is to establish a plantation of about 100 000 ha to feed a pulp mill. A gross area of 300 000 ha has been allocated for the purpose. There are 60 000 people living within these boundaries. The plantations are established in close cooperation with the local population through land-use agreements and a carefully designed benefit system. The benefit system aims to ensure balanced social development, sufficient land availability and, finally, development of a productive plantation. Currently, the established plantation area covers 8600 ha, which consists of 86% Acacia mangium, 6% A. crassicarpa, 3% indigenous species lover 80 species), 3% rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) and 2% Eucalyptus pellita. Intensive site preparation and NPK fertilisation are standard. The initial growth of the plantations has mostly met expectations. However, occasional problems with pests, diseases and nutritional disorders have been recorded during the first two years of practical plantation activities. Long-term availability of sufficient land-area for continuous growth of plantations on a socially sustainable basis will determine the technical success of the project.

TI  - Conserving Social-Ecological Systems in Indonesia: Human-Nonhuman Primate Interconnections in Bali and Sulawesi
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY
AB  - An important question asked by primatologists and conservationists alike is: what is the relevance of primates and primate conservation for ecosystem conservation? The goal of this article is to contribute to this dialogue by advocating the use of a research perspective that focuses on the dynamics of human-nonhuman primate sympatry and interaction (i.e., ethnoprimatology) in order to better understand complex social-ecological systems and to inform their conservation management. This perspective/approach is based largely on the recognition that human primates are important components of all ecological systems and that niche construction is a fundamental feature of their adaptive success. To demonstrate the relevance of the human-nonhuman primate interface for ecosystem conservation, we provide examples from our research from two islands in the Indonesian archipelago: Bali and Sulawesi. In Bali, humans and long-tail macaques coexist in a system that creates favorable environments for the macaques. This anthropogenic landscape and the economic and ecological relationships between humans and monkeys on Bali provide insight into sustainable systems of human/nonhuman primate coexistence. In Lore Lindu National Park in Central Sulawesi, villagers and Tonkean macaques overlap in their use of both forest and cultivated resources. The finding that the Arenga pinnata palm is extremely important for both villagers and macaques points to a conservation management recommendation that may help protect the overall ecosystem; the cultivation and propagation of mutually important tree species at forest-agricultural ecotone as a means to curb crop raiding and to alleviate farmer's perceived need to clear additional forest.

TI  - Synergistic effects of warming and disease linked to high mortality in cool-adapted terrestrial frogs
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Cool-adapted species inhabiting montane tropical forests are vulnerable to heat stress associated with climate warming. According to the thermal mismatch hypothesis, pathogens are predicted to have broader thermal tolerances than their hosts, which can lead to increased pathogen loads and host mortality when temperatures are outside hosts' thermal optima. We tested the thermal mismatch hypothesis in two habitat generalist species expected to have wide thermal tolerance ranges: Dendropsophus minutus captured at a high elevation and D. elegans captured at a warmer low elevation. We also tested high-elevation individuals of the Brazilian direct-developing species Ischnocnema parva, which are expected to have a narrow thermal tolerance range based on life history. We exposed all frogs to the pathogenic fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) under three temperatures ranging from the average nighttime temperature where frogs were collected (16 and 21 degrees C for high and low elevations, respectively) to a simulated warming event (26 degrees C). Bd loads across all three host species were negatively associated with temperature. However, the interaction between Bd infection and warming led to increased mortality in cool-adapted I. parva at higher temperatures, despite lower infection loads. Our results indicate that Bd may lead to declines of cool-adapted montane frogs under the combined pressures of pathogen infection and warming, even at temperatures approaching the pathogen's upper thermal limit. Thus, climatic warming at a level that lowers fitness of heat-sensitive pathogens may not uniformly reduce host disease risk.

TI  - Ancient Ancestry of KFDV and AHFV Revealed by Complete Genome Analyses of Viruses Isolated from Ticks and Mammalian Hosts
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background: Alkhurma hemorrhagic fever virus (AHFV) and Kyasanur forest disease virus (KFDV) cause significant human disease and mortality in Saudi Arabia and India, respectively. Despite their distinct geographic ranges, AHFV and KFDV share a remarkably high sequence identity. Given its emergence decades after KFDV, AHFV has since been considered a variant of KFDV and thought to have arisen from an introduction of KFDV to Saudi Arabia from India. To gain a better understanding of the evolutionary history of AHFV and KFDV, we analyzed the full length genomes of 16 AHFV and 3 KFDV isolates.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Viral genomes were sequenced and compared to two AHFV sequences available in GenBank. Sequence analyses revealed higher genetic diversity within AHFVs isolated from ticks than human AHFV isolates. A Bayesian coalescent phylogenetic analysis demonstrated an ancient divergence of AHFV and KFDV of approximately 700 years ago.
   Conclusions/Significance: The high sequence diversity within tick populations and the presence of competent tick vectors in the surrounding regions, coupled with the recent identification of AHFV in Egypt, indicate possible viral range expansion or a larger geographic range than previously thought. The divergence of AHFV from KFDV nearly 700 years ago suggests other AHFV/KFDV-like viruses might exist in the regions between Saudi Arabia and India. Given the human morbidity and mortality associated with these viruses, these results emphasize the importance of more focused study of these significant public health threats.

TI  - Mosquito community structure in phytotelmata from a South American temperate wetland
T2  - JOURNAL OF VECTOR ECOLOGY
AB  - Phytotelmata, or plant-held waters, are considered to be good model systems for the study of community ecology. The fauna of these natural container habitats, particularly the mosquitoes, have been extensively investigated in tropical regions, but there is little known about them in temperate South America. We assessed the structure of immature mosquito communities in leaf axils, tree holes, and bamboo stumps from a temperate wetland of Argentina. A total of 4,330 immature mosquitoes were collected among the 2,606 phytotelmata inspected. Leaf axils of eight plant species and tree holes were larval habitats for nine mosquito species belonging to the genus Culex, Wyeomyia, Isostomyia, and Toxorhynchites. The mosquito communities showed richness ranging from one to four species. Marked differences were detected in the plant specificity for the species collected. Some of them were exclusively found in one plant species (Isostomyia paranensis in Scirpus giganteus), whereas others were collected in up to five plant species but belonging to the same phytotelm class, the leaf axils. Those from tree holes are well-known dwellers of artificial containers and ground water habitats, such as Culex pipiens. Our results support the idea of low mosquito richness in phytotelmata from temperate regions in comparison with tropical areas, but the observed specificity patterns echo the findings of tropical forests.

TI  - Antiviral RNAi Response in <i>Culex quinquefasciatus</i>-Derived HSU Cells
T2  - VIRUSES-BASEL
AB  - Culex spp. mosquitoes are important vectors of viruses, such as West Nile virus, Eastern equine encephalitis virus and Rift valley fever virus. However, their interactions with innate antiviral immunity, especially RNA interference (RNAi), are not well known. Most research on RNAi pathways in mosquitoes is focused on the tropical vector mosquito Aedes aegypti. Here, we investigated the production of arbovirus-specific small RNAs in Cx. quinquefasciatus-derived HSU cells. Furthermore, by silencing RNAi-related proteins, we investigated the antiviral role of these proteins for two different arboviruses: Semliki Forest virus (SFV) and Bunyamwera orthobunyavirus (BUNV). Our results showed an expansion of Ago2 and Piwi6 in Cx. quinquefasciatus compared to Ae. aegypti. While silencing Ago2a and Ago2b increased BUNV replication, only Ago2b showed antiviral activity against SFV. Our results suggest differences in the function of Cx. quinquefasciatus and Ae. aegypti RNAi proteins and highlight the virus-specific function of these proteins in Cx. quinquefasciatus.

TI  - In the Heart of the Amazon: Noncommunicable Diseases and Apolipoprotein E4 Genotype in the Riverine Population
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - The Amazon River basin is the largest tropical forest in the world. Most of the Amazon belongs to Brazil, a developing country that currently faces huge challenges related to the consolidation of its universal healthcare system. Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) are the leading cause of death in Brazil, accounting for 74% of all deaths, and NCDs are probably underestimated in Amazonian population because of their geographical isolation and the precariousness of riverine communities. Important risk factors, such as genetic susceptibility, remain undetermined in the riverine population. This study performed fasting blood sugar (FBS) and blood pressure measurements and investigated the presence of the epsilon 4 allele of apolipoprotein E (APOE4) to determine the prevalence of diabetes, hypertension and the genetic risk of NCDs. FBS and APOE4 were measured in blood samples from 763 participants using spectrometry and real-time PCR; 67.5% showed altered measurements, and 57.9% had never been diagnosed or treated. Altered FBS was found in 28.3% of the participants, hypertension in 57.6% and APOE4 in 32.0%. The health profile of the riverine population appears to differ from that of urban population in the Amazon. Additional risk factors for NCDs, such as environmental contamination and nutritional transition, may contribute more than increased genetic susceptibility to the prevalence of altered FBS and hypertension. Our results will help guide the development of preventive strategies and governmental actions for more effective management of NCDs in the Amazon area.

TI  - Dengue: A Growing Problem With New Interventions
T2  - PEDIATRICS
AB  - Dengue is the disease caused by 1 of 3 distinct, but closely related dengue viruses (DENV-1-4) that are transmitted by Aedes spp. mosquito vectors. It is the most common arboviral disease worldwide, with the greatest burden in tropical and sub-tropical regions. In the absence of effective prevention and control measures, dengue is projected to increase in both disease burden and geographic range. Given its increasing importance as an etiology of fever in the returning traveler or the possibility of local transmission in regions in the United States with competent vectors, as well as the risk for large outbreaks in endemic US territories and associated states, clinicians should understand its clinical presentation and be familiar with appropriate testing, triage, and management of patients with dengue. Control and prevention efforts reached a milestone in June 2021 when the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended Dengvaxia for routine use in children aged 9 to 16 years living in endemic areas with laboratory confirmation of previous dengue virus infection. Dengvaxia is the first vaccine against dengue to be recommended for use in the United States and one of the first to require laboratory testing of potential recipients to be eligible for vaccination. In this review, we outline dengue pathogenesis, epidemiology, and key clinical features for front-line clinicians evaluating patients presenting with dengue. We also provide a summary of Dengvaxia efficacy, safety, and considerations for use as well as an overview of other potential new tools to control and prevent the growing threat of dengue .

TI  - Description of malaria vectors (Diptera: Culicidae) in two agricultural settlements in the Western Brazilian Amazon
T2  - REVISTA DO INSTITUTO DE MEDICINA TROPICAL DE SAO PAULO
AB  - The majority of malaria cases in South America occur in rural areas of the Amazon region. Although these areas have a significant impact on malaria cases, few entomological studies have been carried out there. This study aimed to describe entomological parameters in settlements in Rondonia State, Brazil. Collections of anopheles were carried out using the Protected Human Attraction Technique (PHAT). The risk and the potential for malaria transmission were assessed using the human biting rate (HBR), the sporozoite rate (SR) and the entomological inoculation rate (EIR). The results confirmed that Nyssorhynchus darlingi is the predominant species in the two studied locations. Although settlement in the two study sites has occurred at different times, the species richness found was low, showing that environmental changes caused by anthropological actions have probably favor the adaptation of Ny. darlingi species. From the total of 615 anopheline mosquitoes assessed, seven (1.1%) were positive for Plasmodium sp. infections. The EIR revealed that Ny. darlingi contributes to malaria transmission in both locations, as it was responsible for 0.05 infectious bites in humans at night in the old settlement and 0.02 in the recent occupation. In the two study sites, the biting occurred more frequently at dusk. Nyssorhynchus darlingi was prevalent in areas of recent colonization but, even when present in a low density, this species could maintain the transmission of malaria in the older settlement. The entomological information obtained in this study is important and may aid the selection of vector control actions in these locations.

TI  - Reaction of cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L. Walp.) to six isolates of blackeye cowpea mosaic virus (BICMV) and cowpea aphid-borne mosaic virus (CAMV), two potyviruses infecting cowpea in Nigeria
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PEST MANAGEMENT
AB  - Five potyvirus isolates from various cowpea-producing areas (Guinea and Sudan savannas and forest zones) in Nigeria were identified by serology and infectivity tests as BICMV (Isolates IT15, IT16 and WC) or as CAMV (isolates IT11 and ZARIA) and compared with the standard isolate of blackeye cowpea mosaic virus (BICMV) (isolate ONNE) used at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) for screening purposes. According to the type and severity of symptoms on Nicotiana benthamiana and on selected susceptible cowpea cultivars, the BICMV and CAMV isolates studied were grouped into three categories. Members of the first group (isolates IT15 and IT16) induced mild-to-severe bright yellow mosaic on selected susceptible cowpea cultivars and could not easily infect Nicotiana benthamiana, but the other two groups of isolates readily infected this plant. In the second group of isolates, ONNE and WC induced mosaic with variable severity in dark green and yellow patches. The third group (isolates IT11 and ZARIA) induced mild green mosaic and veinbanding symptoms on different cowpea lines. An evaluation of cowpea germplasm accessions and breeding lines using these BICMV and CAMV isolates has shown that germplasm accessions TVu 401, TVu 1453 and TVu 1948 and breeding lines IT82D-885, IT82D-889 and IT82E-60 possess resistance genes to all six potyvirus isolates. These lines could be used in breeding programs at IITA to develop new cowpea varieties.

TI  - Hyperspectral analysis of mangrove foliar chemistry using PLSR and support vector regression
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Hyperspectral remote sensing enables the large-scale mapping of canopy biochemical properties. This study explored the possibility of retrieving the concentration of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and sodium from mangroves in the Berau Delta, Indonesia. The objectives of the study were to (1) assess the accuracy of foliar chemistry retrieval, (2) compare the performance of models based on support vector regression (SVR), i.e. E-SVR, -SVR, and least squares SVR (LS-SVR), to models based on partial least squares regression (PLSR), and (3) investigate which spectral transformations are best suited. The results indicated that nitrogen could be successfully modelled at the landscape level (R-2=0.67, root mean square error (RMSE)=0.17, normalized RMSE (nRMSE)=15%), whereas estimations of P, K, Ca, Mg, and Na were less encouraging. The developed nitrogen model was applied over the study area to generate a map of foliar N variation, which can be used for studying ecosystem processes in mangroves. While PLSR attained good results directly using all untransformed bands, the highest accuracy for nitrogen modelling was achieved using a combination of LS-SVR and continuum-removed derivative reflectance. All SVR techniques suffered from multicollinearity when using the full spectrum, and the number of independent variables had to be reduced by singling out the most informative wavelength bands. This was achieved by interpreting and visualizing the structure of the PLSR and SVR models.

TI  - Accumulation of medium chain fatty acids in<i> Nannochloropsis</i><i> oceanica</i> by heterologous expression of<i> Cuphea</i><i> palustris</i> thioesterase FatB1
T2  - ALGAL RESEARCH-BIOMASS BIOFUELS AND BIOPRODUCTS
AB  - Medium chain fatty acids (MCFAs) are compounds of considerable commercial interest that have applications in food, feed, and the production of industrially relevant chemicals. Due to their antipathogenic and health promoting effects, they are further discussed as potential therapeutic agents for disease treatment and infection prevention and control. Domesticated agricultural crops that can grow in temperate climates lack MCFAs, and increased cultivation of tropical MCFA-rich species such as oil palm is associated with deforestation and a decrease in biodiversity. Alternative sources for more sustainably produced MCFAs are non-domesticated plants such as Cuphea spp., as well as oil crops and oleaginous microalgae that can be genetically engineered to accumulate MCFAs by expression of acyl-acyl carrier protein thioesterases (TEs) from MCFA-producing plants. Here, we report the heterologous expression of a TE from Cuphea palustris in the industrially relevant microalga Nannochloropsis oceanica. Using a recently developed gene expression system, we engineered transformant strains that accumulated up to 2.84 and 4.15% of C8:0 and C10:0 in storage lipids, respectively, and we observed no effect on growth. We further show that MCFA accumulation was negatively correlated with total neutral lipid content, suggesting the presence of regulatory mechanisms that limit MCFA accumulation in Nannochloropsis.

TI  - Partner-Drug Resistance and Population Substructuring of Artemisinin-Resistant <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> in Cambodia
T2  - GENOME BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB  - Plasmodium falciparum in western Cambodia has developed resistance to artemisinin and its partner drugs, causing frequent treatment failure. Understanding this evolution can inform the deployment of new therapies. We investigated the genetic architecture of 78 falciparum isolates using whole-genome sequencing, correlating results to in vivo and ex vivo drug resistance and exploring the relationship between population structure, demographic history, and partner drug resistance. Principle component analysis, network analysis and demographic inference identified a diverse central population with three clusters of clonally expanding parasite populations, each associated with specific K13 artemisinin resistance alleles and partner drug resistance profiles which were consistent with the sequential deployment of artemisinin combination therapies in the region. One cluster displayed ex vivo piperaquine resistance and mefloquine sensitivity with a high rate of in vivo failure of dihydroartemisininpiperaquine. Another cluster displayed ex vivo mefloquine resistance and piperaquine sensitivity with high in vivo efficacy of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine. The final cluster was clonal and displayed intermediate sensitivity to both drugs. Variations in recently described piperaquine resistance markers did not explain the difference in mean IC90 or clinical failures between the high and intermediate piperaquine resistance groups, suggesting additional loci may be involved in resistance. The results highlight an important role for partner drug resistance in shaping the P. falciparum genetic landscape in Southeast Asia and suggest that further work is needed to evaluate for other mutations that drive piperaquine resistance.

TI  - Biting time of <i>Anopheles darlingi</i> in the Bolivian Amazon and implications for control of malaria
T2  - TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Malaria is a growing problem in the Bolivian Amazon where there has been a four-fold increase between 1991 and 1998, largely owing to forest clearance bringing human and vector into closer association. The principle vector in this region is Anopheles darlingi Root, the behaviour of which has been tittle studied in this part of South America. The peak time of biting of A. darlingi was studied over a series of nights in July 2003 during the dry season in the town of Riberalta in the Bolivian Amazon. Peak biting occurred between 19:00 and 21:00 hours, when 48% of the total night's biting took place. This early biting habit has implications regarding control of malaria via the use of insecticide-treated bed nets. Anopheles darlingi was the most prevalent vector in the study, although A. albitarsis s.l. and A. braziliensis were also present. (c) 2005 Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.

TI  - Description and bionomics of <i>Anopheles</i> (<i>Cellia</i>) <i>ovengensis</i> (Diptera: Culicidae), a new malaria vector species of the <i>Anopheles nili</i> group from south Cameroon
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - Mosquito species of the Anopheles nili group (Diptera: Culicidae) transmit malaria to humans along rivers in Africa. To date, the An. nili group includes the species Anopheles nili s.s. and kits pale-winged variant known as the "Congo form," Anopheles somalicus and Anopheles carnevalei. Larval and adult mosquito collections in the forest region of Campo, in southern Cameroon, uncovered an additional morphological variant provisionally called "Oveng form" that was subsequently found to be genetically distinct from the other members of the An. nili group. In this study, we provide further biological data that characterizes this new taxon and justifies elevation to specific rank. We propose calling this new species Anopheles ovengensis, after its geographical origin. We present a morphological description of the adult female and fourth instars and original data on the biology, ecology, and role as a human malaria vector of this new species in its type location. We provide dichotomous keys for identification of adult females and fourth instars that can be used at least in tropical areas of west and central Africa.

TI  - Record of epidemiologically important Culicidae in the rural area of Manaus, Amazonas
T2  - REVISTA DA SOCIEDADE BRASILEIRA DE MEDICINA TROPICAL
AB  - The biodiversity of the Amazon region includes many species of arthropod vectors in different ecotopes, thus enabling occurrences of diseases like malaria, filariasis and arbovirosis. From August 2001 to July 2002, we gathered culicids from inside homes, from areas surrounding these homes and from forested areas of the Sao Joao Community, in the rural zone of Manaus, State of Amazonas. 1240 specimens were collected, belonging to the Culicinae (99%) and Anophelinae (1%) subfamilies, with 50 species. The Culicini tribe clearly predominated, with 904 specimens (72.9%), and the species Culex usquatus (22.6%) and Culex quinquefasciatus (17.7%) were prominent. Out of the total number of culicids, 1,077 (86.9%) were caught in the forests, 101 (8.1%) in the areas surrounding homes and 62 (5%) inside homes. Forests were the ecotope that presented the highest species diversity. The presence of Anopheles darlingi, Anopheles triannulatus, Aedes aegypti, Haemagogus janthinomys and other proven or potential vectors was recorded.

TI  - A Universal and Efficient Detection of Chytridiomycosis Infections in Amphibians Using Novel Quantitative PCR Markers
T2  - TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES
AB  - Chytridiomycosis is an infectious disease in amphibians caused by two chytrid fungi, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) and Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans (Bsal), and is the worst infectious disease known in wildlife so far. Worldwide spread of the disease has caused unprecedented loss of global amphibian diversity. Although some lineages of Bd are enzootic and are not as deadly as the pandemic lineage, nearly 40% of amphibian species are still declining globally due to chytridiomycosis. Efficient surveillance and monitoring of chytridiomycosis are the immediate safeguard against rapid declines or extinctions of amphibian populations. Previous studies showed that existing diagnostic assays were not sensitive to certain Bd haplotypes like those from Korea, China, India, Japan, and Brazil and thereby, there is a need for a universal, sensitive, specific, reproducible, and affordable diagnostic assay. We designed a one-step SYBR green-based quantitative polymerase chain reaction (nSYBR qPCR) for robust detection of Bd. It amplifies an 82 base-pair segment between the 5.8S rRNA and ITS2 of the Bd genome. The primer pair was tested in-silico on 40 isolates from four known Bd lineages. Using skin swab samples of wild amphibians and cultured zoospores from Australia and Panama, we compared the clinical specificity and sensitivity of the newly described primers to the existing TaqMan-based qPCR assay. From India, we used samples which had been previously tested with Nested PCR to validate the new primer pairs. The newly described primer pair was then tested on swab samples from Anura, Caudata and Gymnophiona from India. We report widespread chytridiomycosis with varying infection loads on them. The new assay showed comparable efficiency to the TaqMan-based qPCR assay. This diagnostic assay can facilitate widespread surveillance of chytridiomycosis where it has been previously absent, which may reveal several reservoirs of the pathogen and can improve our understanding of this important wildlife disease.

TI  - <i>In vitro</i> schistosomicidal activity of the crude extract, fractions and Primin, the major active benzoquinone constituent from the leaves of <i>Miconia willdenowii</i> (Melastomaceae)
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
AB  - Eight native plant extracts from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, Acacia polyphylla, Allophylus racemosus, Casearia arborea, Duguetia lanceolata, Metrodorea stipularis, Trichilia emarginata, Miconia willdenowii, Mollinedia widgrenii, were screened for potential schistosomicidal activity. The crude ethanolic extract of Miconia willdenowii (at a concentration of 200 mu g/mL) showed the most promising results, killing approximately 65% of the Schistossoma mansoni worms, in comparison to praziquantel. This extract was then submitted to a bioguided-phytochemical study. After liquid-liquid partition was performed, the hexane subfraction disclosed the most significant schistosomicidal activity of 80% against the adult worms at a concentration of 75 mu g/mL and 25% at 50,mu g/mL Purification of this active subfraction led to the isolation of 2-methoxy-6-pentyl-benzoquinone (1, also known as Primin) as the active metabolite responsible for the observed schistosomicidal effect (IC50 = 7.08 mu g/mL). The schistosomicidal effect of M. willdenowii and Primin is the first time in which such a result has been reported. (C) 2017 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Evaluation of Methods for Collecting Mosquitoes (Culicidae: Diptera) in Canopy and Ground Strata in the Brazilian Savanna
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE
AB  - The hand-net is the standard method for capturing mosquitoes with sylvatic diurnal activity in disease outbreaks in Brazil. However, occupational risks and biases related to the collectors' abilities and attractiveness are important limitations. In this study, we compared hand-nets with automatic traps (CDC) associated to CO2 and BG-Lure (R) in the Vassununga State Park, a Brazilian Savanna protection area. The collections carried out over 27 days on the ground and the forest canopy. A total of 1555 mosquitoes were obtained in 20 taxa. The diversity index ranged between 1.12 and 1.79 and the dominance index from 0.22 to 0.40. The dominant species on the ground was Aedes scapularis (46.0%), and in the canopy, Hg. janthinomys/capricornii (31.9%). Haemagogus leucocelaenus was rare (n = 2). The hand-net resulted in the greatest diversity and abundance of species in both strata, followed by the traps associated with CO2. A low degree of similarity was observed between the hand-net on the ground compared to the other capture methods. The use of BG-Lure (R) alone resulted in a low number of specimens. In conclusion, the hand-net is still the method of choice for collecting arbovirus vectors in the diurnal period, especially yellow fever vectors.

TI  - Land Use and Land Cover Changes and Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Anopheline Larval Habitats during a Four-Year Period in a Highland Community of Africa
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Spatial and temporal variations in the distribution of anopheline larval habitats and land use and land cover (LULC) changes call influence malaria transmission intensity. This information is important for understanding the environmental determinants of malaria transmission heterogeneity, and it is critical to the study of the effects of environmental changes on malaria transmission. In this study, we investigated the spatial and temporal variations in the distribution of anopheline larval habitats and LULC changes in western Kenya highlands over a 4-year period. Anopheles gambiae complex larvae were mainly confined to valley bottoms during both the dry and wet seasons. Although An. gambiae larvae were located in man-made habitats where riparian forests and natural swamps had been cleared, Anopheles funestus larvae were mainly found in permanent habitats in pastures. The association between land cover type and occurrence of anopheline larvae was statistically significant. The distribution of anopheline positive habitats varied significantly between months, during the survey. In 2004, the mean density of An. gambiae was significantly higher during the month 4 May, whereas the density of An. funestus peaked significantly in February. Over the study period, major LULC changes occurred mostly in the valley bottoms. Overall, farmland increased by 3.9%, whereas both Pastures and natural swamps decreased by 8.9% and 20.9%, respectively. The area under forest cover was decreased by 5.8%. Land-use changes in the study area are favorable to An. gambiae larval development, thereby risking it more widespread distribution of malaria vector habitats and potentially increasing malaria transmission in western Kenya highlands.

TI  - Management and modeling approaches for controlling raccoon rabies: The road to elimination
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Rabies is an ancient viral disease that significantly impacts human and animal health throughout the world. In the developing parts of the world, dog bites represent the highest risk of rabies infection to people, livestock, and other animals. However, in North America, where several rabies virus variants currently circulate in wildlife, human contact with the raccoon rabies variant leads to the highest per capita population administration of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) annually. Previous rabies variant elimination in raccoons (Canada), foxes (Europe), and dogs and coyotes (United States) demonstrates that elimination of the raccoon variant from the eastern US is feasible, given an understanding of rabies control costs and benefits and the availability of proper tools. Also critical is a cooperatively produced strategic plan that emphasizes collaborative rabies management among agencies and organizations at the landscape scale. Common management strategies, alone or as part of an integrated approach, include the following: oral rabies vaccination (ORV), trap-vaccinate-release (TVR), and local population reduction. As a complement, mathematical and statistical modeling approaches can guide intervention planning, such as through contact networks, circuit theory, individual-based modeling, and others, which can be used to better understand and predict rabies dynamics through simulated interactions among the host, virus, environment, and control strategy. Strategies derived from this ecological lens can then be optimized to produce a management plan that balances the ecological needs and program financial resources. This paper discusses the management and modeling strategies that are currently used, or have been used in the past, and provides a platform of options for consideration while developing raccoon rabies virus elimination strategies in the US.

TI  - Ethnomedicinal and ecological status of plants in Garhwal Himalaya, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY AND ETHNOMEDICINE
AB  - Background: The northern part of India harbours a great diversity of medicinal plants due to its distinct geography and ecological marginal conditions. The traditional medical systems of northern India are part of a time tested culture and honored still by people today. These traditional systems have been curing complex disease for more than 3,000 years. With rapidly growing demand for these medicinal plants, most of the plant populations have been depleted, indicating a lack of ecological knowledge among communities using the plants. Thus, an attempt was made in this study to focus on the ecological status of ethnomedicinal plants, to determine their availability in the growing sites, and to inform the communities about the sustainable exploitation of medicinal plants in the wild.
   Methods: The ecological information regarding ethnomedicinal plants was collected in three different climatic regions (tropical, sub-tropical and temperate) for species composition in different forest layers. The ecological information was assessed using the quadrate sampling method. A total of 25 quadrats, 10 x 10 m were laid out at random in order to sample trees and shrubs, and 40 quadrats of 1 x 1 m for herbaceous plants. In each climatic region, three vegetation sites were selected for ecological information; the mean values of density, basal cover, and the importance value index from all sites of each region were used to interpret the final data. Ethnomedicinal uses were collected from informants of adjacent villages. About 10% of inhabitants (older, experienced men and women) were interviewed about their use of medicinal plants. A consensus analysis of medicinal plant use between the different populations was conducted.
   Results: Across the different climatic regions a total of 57 species of plants were reported: 14 tree species, 10 shrub species, and 33 herb species. In the tropical and sub-tropical regions, Acacia catechu was the dominant tree while Ougeinia oojeinensis in the tropical region and Terminalia belerica in the sub-tropical region were least dominant reported. In the temperate region, Quercus leucotrichophora was the dominant tree and Pyrus pashia the least dominant tree. A total of 10 shrubs were recorded in all three regions: Adhatoda vasica was common species in the tropical and sub-tropical regions however, Rhus parviflora was common species in the sub-tropical and temperate regions. Among the 33 herbs, Sida cordifolia was dominant in the tropical and sub-tropical regions, while Barleria prionitis the least dominant in tropical and Phyllanthus amarus in the sub-tropical region. In temperate region, Vernonia anthelmintica was dominant and Imperata cylindrica least dominant. The consensus survey indicated that the inhabitants have a high level of agreement regarding the usages of single plant. The index value was high (1.0) for warts, vomiting, carminative, pain, boils and antiseptic uses, and lowest index value (0.33) was found for bronchitis.
   Conclusion: The medicinal plants treated various ailments. These included diarrhea, dysentery, bronchitis, menstrual disorders, gonorrhea, pulmonary affections, migraines, leprosy. The ecological studies showed that the tree density and total basal cover increased from the tropical region to sub-tropical and temperate regions. The species composition changed with climatic conditions. Among the localities used for data collection in each climatic region, many had very poor vegetation cover. The herbaceous layer decreased with increasing altitude,

TI  - The ecology, behavior, and conservation of a west indian corvid, the white-necked crow (<i>Corvus leucognaphalus</i>)
T2  - ORNITOLOGIA NEOTROPICAL
AB  - The White-necked Crow (Corvus leucognaphalus) formerly inhabited St. Croix, Puerto Rico, and Hispaniola. It survives only in Hispaniola, where populations are declining for some of the same reasons primarily responsible for its extirpation from Puerto Rico: habitat fragmentation and loss, and shooting. Egg and chick depredation by the Pearly-eyed Thrasher (Margarops fuscatus) was also important in the extirpation of the Puerto Rico population. I studied the crow in the Dominican Republic intermittently from 1974 to 2004. The species occupies a wide range of habitats, including wet coastal and montane forest, pine forest, cactus forest, mangrove swamp, and palm savanna. Its vocal behavior is complex and diverse, more like that of ravens than of crows. White-necked Crows fed on a wide variety of plant and animal matter. Foraging crows selected plant materials in 76.4% of my observations, whereas animals made up 51.6% of the food items delivered to nestlings. Core activity areas of three breeding pairs averaged 9.8 +/- 3.7 ha, whereas their average territory size was 5.5 +/- 5.2 ha. Nest budding began in late January. Nests were bulky structures placed high in trees. Eggs were incubated 18-22 days and the nestling period was 35-44 days.

TI  - Effect of Flock Size and Ecological Area in the Technological Level of Dual-Purpose Cattle System from Ecuadorian Tropics
T2  - REVISTA CIENTIFICA-FACULTAD DE CIENCIAS VETERINARIAS
AB  - Technological level of double purpose bovine farms in the Ecuadorian Coast Area is provided. The effect of flock size and ecological area over results was evaluated. A random sample of 44 farms was collected and a survey composed by 125 questions was applied. As main classification factors, flock size, according to the number of cows (small and medium size) and ecological area (dry and tropical forests) were considered. 38 technologies were included and classified by means of an expert panel in six technological areas. Later, the level of innovation for each region was calculated according to the criteria of having implemented or not the technology (1 and 0). The comparison of multiple samples was used to classify areas and after that, a general lineal model containing two factors is applied (GLM). The level of technological innovation was a 51%, where the areas of animal feeding, reproduction-genetics and health are the more advance ones. There was an outstanding impact of size and ecological area over the global technological level. This way the smallest farms were the ones located in the dry tropical forest and present lower levels of technological adoption. On the contrary, medium size farms located in the wet forest showed higher technological levels. The improvement in the technological level of implementation requires of multiple actions; amongst others, those related to managerial aspects as the individual animal identification and the use of productive records. A strategic approach must be followed; for the development of reproductive plans and prevention, the fight and control of diseases. Besides, the improvement of the equipment requires of basic actions as the building of stockyards, the improvement of the milking parlor among others.

TI  - Genetic reassortment of Rift Valley fever virus in nature
T2  - JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY
AB  - Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), a phlebovirus of the Bungaviridae family, is an arthropod-borne virus which emerges periodically throughout Africa, emphasizing that it poses a major threat fur animal and human populations. To assess the genetic variability of RVFV, several isolates from diverse localities of Africa were investigated, by means of reverse transcription-PCR followed by direct sequencing of a region of the small (S), medium (M), and large (L) genomic segments. Phylogenetic analysis showed the existence of three major lineages corresponding to geographic variants from West Africa, Egypt, and Central-East Africa. However, incongruences detected between the L, M, and S phylogenies suggested that genetic exchange via reassortment occurred between strains from different lineages. This hypothesis, depicted by parallel phylogenies, was further confirmed by statistical tests. Our findings, which strongly suggest exchanges between strains from areas of endemicity in West and East Africa, strengthen the potential existence of a sylvatic cycle in the tropical rain forest. This also emphasizes the risk of generating uncontrolled chimeric viruses by using live attenuated vaccines in areas of endemicity.

TI  - Vicarious calibration of the third and fourth Stokes parameters of Windsat measurements
T2  - APPLIED OPTICS
AB  - Microwave observations made at the third and fourth Stokes parameters can be used to determine the surface wind direction over oceans. However, due to their smaller amplitudes (less than 3 K at the third Stokes parameter and I K at the fourth Stokes parameter), the absolute calibration to these measurements becomes crucial. A new methodology is developed in this study to calibrate the Windsat third and fourth Stokes parameters through tropical rain forest measurements over the Amazon and central Africa. It is found that the Windsat fourth Stokes parameter at 18 GHz has biases of the order of 0.5 K, which could severely affect the wind vector retrievals. (c) 2005 Optical Society of America.

TI  - Quercetin and quercetin 3-<i>O-</i>glycosides from <i>Bauhinia longifolia</i> (Bong.) Steud. show anti-Mayaro virus activity
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
AB  - Background: The arthropod-borne Mayaro virus (MAYV) causes 'Mayaro fever', a disease of medical significance, primarily affecting individuals in permanent contact with forested areas in tropical South America. Recently, MAYV has attracted attention due to its likely urbanization. Currently, there are no licensed drugs against most mosquito-transmitted viruses. Here, we investigated the in vitro anti-MAYV activity of the flavonoids quercetin and its derivatives from the Brazilian shrub Bauhinia longifolia (Bong.) Steud.
   Methods: Flavonoids were purified by chromatographic fractionation from leaf extracts of B. longifolia and chemically identified as quercetin and quercetin glycosides using spectroscopic techniques. Cytotoxicity of purified flavonoids and of EtOAc- and n-BuOH-containing flavonoid mixtures was measured by the dye-uptake assay while their antiviral activity was evaluated by a virus yield inhibition assay.
   Results: The following flavonoids were purified from B. longifolia leaves: non-glycosylated quercetin and its glycosides guaijaverin, quercitrin, isoquercitrin, and hyperin. EtOAc and n-BuOH fractions containing these flavonoids demonstrated the highest antiviral activity of all tested substances, while quercetin had the highest antiviral activity amongst purified flavonoids. Quercetin, EtOAc, or n-BuOH fractions inhibited MAYV production by more than 90% at 25 mu g/mL, displaying a stronger antiviral effect than the licensed antiviral ribavirin. A mixture of the isomers isoquercitrin and hyperin had a modest antiviral effect (IC90 = 104.9), while guaijaverin and quercitrin did not show significant antiviral activity.
   Conclusions: B. longifolia is a good source of flavonoids with anti-Mayaro virus activity. This is the first report of the activity of quercetin and its derivatives against an alphavirus.

TI  - Xpert MTB/RIF Testing in a Low Tuberculosis Incidence, High-Resource Setting: Limitations in Accuracy and Clinical Impact
T2  - CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB  - Background. Xpert MTB/RIF, the first automated molecular test for tuberculosis, is transforming the diagnostic landscape in low-income countries. However, little information is available on its performance in low-incidence, high-resource countries.
   Methods. We evaluated the accuracy of Xpert in a university hospital tuberculosis clinic in Montreal, Canada, for the detection of pulmonary tuberculosis on induced sputum samples, using mycobacterial cultures as the reference standard. We also assessed the potential reduction in time to diagnosis and treatment initiation.
   Results. We enrolled 502 consecutive patients who presented for evaluation of possible active tuberculosis (most with abnormal chest radiographs, only 18% symptomatic). Twenty-five subjects were identified to have active tuberculosis by culture. Xpert had a sensitivity of 46% (95% confidence interval [CI], 26%-67%) and specificity of 100% (95% CI, 99%-100%) for detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Sensitivity was 86% (95% CI, 42%-100%) in the 7 subjects with smear-positive results, and 28% (95% CI, 10%-56%) in the remaining subjects with smear-negative, culture-positive results; in this latter group, positive Xpert results were obtained a median 12 days before culture results. Subjects with positive cultures but negative Xpert results had minimal disease: 11 of 13 had no symptoms on presentation, and mean time to positive liquid culture results was 28 days (95% CI, 25-47 days) compared with 14 days (95% CI, 8-21 days) in Xpert/culture-positive cases.
   Conclusions. Our findings suggest limited potential impact of Xpert testing in high-resource, low-incidence ambulatory settings due to lower sensitivity in the context of less extensive disease, and limited potential to expedite diagnosis beyond what is achieved with the existing, well-performing diagnostic algorithm.

TI  - Evaluation of accuracy and reliability of the plaque reduction neutralization test (<i>micro</i>-PRNT) in detection of yellow fever virus antibodies
T2  - BIOLOGICALS
AB  - Yellow fever is a disease caused by the prototype virus of the genus Flavivirus and remains endemic in tropical forest regions from Africa and South America, despite the availability of effective vaccines. These are capable of inducing a rapid specific immune response, with the formation of neutralizing antibodies that appear early, are protective and long lasting. The Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test is considered the most sensitive and specific test for quantification of neutralizing antibodies, and the reference method for assessing the protective immune response after vaccination. This study evaluated the reliability (repeatability and reproducibility) and accuracy (sensitivity, specificity and overall accuracy) of micro-PRNT50 and compared its performance with the micro-PRNT90. Although the micro-PRNT50 has showed satisfactory levels of reliability (ICCs ranged from 0.62 to 0.NorNormas e Manuais Tecnicosas e Manuais Tecnicos6 for repeatability and 0.72 for reproducibility) and accuracy (sensitivity of 91.1%, specificity of 72.9% and overall accuracy of 78%), the micro-PRNT90 showed higher performance, with ICCs for repeatability ranged from 0.78 to 0.79 and 0.81 for reproducibility, sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 94.7% and overall accuracy of 95%. Modifications in the test methodology and changes in the classification criteria in the readings of the results obtained will be important to improve the accuracy of micro-PRNT.

TI  - Characterization, expression, and antimicrobial activity of histones from Japanese flounder <i>Paralichthys olivaceus</i>
T2  - FISH & SHELLFISH IMMUNOLOGY
AB  - Histone proteins are not only structurally important for chromosomal DNA packaging but also involved in the regulation of gene expression and the immune response of host against pathogens. Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) as one of the most important marine flatfish, suffered from widespread outbreaks of diseases, and its immunological functioning remained to be elucidated. In the present study, we reported the expression patterns of four histones (Hi, H2A, H3, and H3.3) and functional characterization of the histone H3.3 from flounder. Quantitative real time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis showed that expression of the four histones occurred in multiple tissues, but their levels of expression were relatively high in immune organs, and inducible in response to pathogens infection. Infection with extracellular and intracellular bacterial pathogens and viral pathogen regulated the expression of histones in a manner that depended on tissue type, pathogen, and infection stage. Specifically, H1 expression was highly induced by intracellular viral pathogens; H2AX and H3 expressions were highly induced by intracellular bacterial pathogen; dissimilarly, H3.3 expression was slightly induced by extracellular bacterial pathogen, but was inhibited by intracellular bacterial and viral pathogens. To further investigate H3.3 function, recombinant H3.3 (rH3.3) was obtained, and in vitro experiments showed rH3.3 possessed the capability of binding to both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria and inhibiting the growth of some target bacteria. Consistently, In vivo results showed that overexpression of H3.3 promoted the host defense against invading pathogenic microorganism and regulated the expressions of several cytokines. These results suggested that flounder histones exhibit different expression patterns in response to the infection of different microbial pathogens, and H3.3 serves as an immune-related protein and plays an important role in antimicrobial immunity of Japanese flounder. Taken together, this study is the first report about the expression profile of different histones upon different kind of pathogens and anti-infectious immunity of H3.3 in teleost, which offered new insights into the immunological function of histones in teleost.

TI  - Distinct population structure for co-occurring <i>Anopheles goeldii</i> and <i>Anopheles triannulatus</i> in Amazonian Brazil
T2  - MEMORIAS DO INSTITUTO OSWALDO CRUZ
AB  - To evaluate whether environmental heterogeneity contributes to the genetic heterogeneity in Anopheles triannulatus, larval habitat characteristics across the Brazilian states of Roraima and Para and genetic sequences were examined. A comparison with Anopheles goeldii was utilised to determine whether high genetic diversity was unique to An. triannulatus. Student t test and analysis of variance found no differences in habitat characteristics between the species. Analysis of population structure of An. triannulatus and An. goeldii revealed distinct demographic histories in a largely overlapping geographic range. Cytochrome oxidase I sequence parsimony networks found geographic clustering for both species; however nuclear marker networks depicted An. triannulatus with a more complex history of fragmentation, secondary contact and recent divergence. Evidence of Pleistocene expansions suggests both species are more likely to be genetically structured by geographic and ecological barriers than demography. We hypothesise that niche partitioning is a driving force for diversity, particularly in An. triannulatus.

TI  - Neotropical bats that co-habit with humans function as dead-end hosts for dengue virus
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Several studies have shown Dengue Virus (DENV) nucleic acids and/or antibodies present in Neotropical wildlife including bats, suggesting that some bat species may be susceptible to DENV infection. Here we aim to elucidate the role of house-roosting bats in the DENV transmission cycle. Bats were sampled in households located in high and low dengue incidence regions during rainy and dry seasons in Costa Rica. We captured 318 bats from 12 different species in 29 households. Necropsies were performed in 205 bats to analyze virus presence in heart, lung, spleen, liver, intestine, kidney, and brain tissue. Histopathology studies from all organs showed no significant findings of disease or infection. Sera were analyzed by PRNT90 for a seroprevalence of 21.2% (51/241), and by PCR for 8.8% (28/318) positive bats for DENV RNA. From these 28 bats, 11 intestine samples were analyzed by RT-PCR. Two intestines were DENV RNA positive for the same dengue serotype detected in blood. Viral isolation from all positive organs or blood was unsuccessful. Additionally, viral load analyses in positive blood samples by qRT-PCR showed virus concentrations under the minimal dose required for mosquito infection. Simultaneously, 651 mosquitoes were collected using EVS-CO2 traps and analyzed for DENV and feeding preferences (bat cytochrome b). Only three mosquitoes were found DENV positive and none was positive for bat cytochrome b. Our results suggest an accidental presence of DENV in bats probably caused from oral ingestion of infected mosquitoes. Phylogenetic analyses suggest also a spillover event from humans to bats. Therefore, we conclude that bats in these urban environments do not sustain DENV amplification, they do not have a role as reservoirs, but function as epidemiological dead end hosts for this virus.

TI  - Disease progression in plantations of <i>Acacia mangium</i> affected by red root rot (<i>Ganoderma philippii</i>)
T2  - FOREST PATHOLOGY
AB  - The rapid emergence of Acacia mangium as the key industrial plantation species in Indonesia has been followed by the equally rapid emergence of red root rot (Ganoderma philippii) as its potential nemesis. As a consequence, and on severely affected mineral soils in equatorial tropical environments in particular, A.mangium may no longer be capable of producing commercial yields after three rotations. In this experiment, 100-tree plots were established in commercial plantings of A.mangium at five sites which represented the range of growing conditions used for plantation establishment in Indonesia. Repeated monitoring at approximately 6-month intervals of above- and below-ground variables was used to explore relationships between measures of tree health and root rot. Crown colour and density were poor predictors of either the presence or severity of infections. Tree mortality increased more or less linearly with time and led to the progressive coalescence of initially discrete disease gaps. The average rate of disease development was about 0.3% per month, and average time from infection to tree death was conservatively estimated at around 1year. Trees with more than four dead/missing neighbours had a >50% chance of being dead by the following monitoring. By the end of the monitoring period >40% of trees were classified as dead/missing, although this value varied from 20 to 70% depending on site, tree age and rotation. Canonical discriminant analysis correctly allocated >90% trees into their correct group on the first monitoring and similarly classified whether trees would be dead or missing in the following monitoring.

TI  - The hosts and potential geographic range of Dothistroma needle blight
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Dothistroma needle blight, one of the most important foliar diseases of Pinus spp., is caused primarily by the fungus Dothistroma septosporum (Dorog.) Morelet, and to a lesser extent by Dothistroma pini Hulbary. The potential distribution and abundance of Dothistroma spp. was determined by (i) developing a process-oriented model of potential distribution of Dothistroma spp. from known locations, (ii) compiling a comprehensive list of susceptible host species from existing scientific literature and (iii) determining the distribution of susceptible hosts in areas predicted to be suitable for range expansion of Dothistroma spp. Using these three sources of information regions at risk were identified as those that were predicted to be suitable for range expansion by Dothistroma spp. and included significant areas of susceptible host species.
   The process-oriented distribution model, CLIMEX was used to infer the climatic requirements of Dothistroma spp. from laboratory based measurements and 248 disease records in North America and Asia. When validated against 7594 disease observations from Europe, Africa, South America and Oceania, the model correctly predicted that all observations had a suitable climate for Dothistroma spp. The model indicated that the fungi can persist in climates ranging from sub-arctic through temperate, Mediterranean, continental, subtropical to dry tropical regions. The low level of disease detection in many regions projected to be climatically suitable may be due to the low occurrence of susceptible hosts. When areas that were not suitable for susceptible hosts were excluded results suggest that Dothistroma spp. could further extend their range into south east China, Vietnam, Ireland, Western Australia, Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname, Panama, Turkey, Albania and many countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea.

TI  - <i>Paracoccidioides</i> spp. and <i>Histoplasma capsulatum</i>: Current and New Perspectives for Diagnosis and Treatment
T2  - CURRENT TOPICS IN MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY
AB  - The thermally-dimorphic systemic fungal group includes several important human pathogens: Blastomyces dermatitides, Coccidio ides immitis and C. posadasii, Histoplasma capsulatum, Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, P. lutzii, and Talaromyces (Penicillium) marneffei. They usually are geographically restricted and have natural habitats in soil or in plants, and when fungal propagules invade mammalian host by inhalation, they initiate an inflammatory reaction that can result in self-resolution of the infection or cause an acute or chronic disease. In the setting of the AIDS pandemic and the developments in modern medicine, such as immunosuppressive therapy in cancer surgery patients and in transplantation and autoimmune diseases, the incidence of endemic mycoses has progressively increased. Another important factor of the increased incidence of systemic mycoses in certain regions is the progressive devastation of tropical and subtropical forests. In this review, we focus on two of the most important systemic mycoses: paracoccidioidomycosis and histoplasmosis, and their major characteristics in epidemiology, clinical aspects and laboratorial diagnosis.

TI  - Ecosyndemics: The potential synergistic health impacts of highways and dams in the Amazon
T2  - SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE
AB  - Ecosyndemics refer to disease interactions that result from environmental changes commonly caused by humans. In this paper, we push scholarship on ecosyndemics into new territory by using the ecosyndemic framework to compare two case studies-the Southern Interoceanic highway in Peru and the Belo Monte hydroelectric dam in Brazil-to assess the likelihood of socio-environmental factors interacting and leading to ill health in a syndemic fashion. Assessing these two case studies using an ecosyndemic perspective, we find that the construction of dams and highways in tropical forests create the conditions for increases in vector-borne illnesses, surges in sex work and sexually-transmitted infections, and increased psychological stress resulting from violence, delinquency, and the erosion of social cohesion. We suggest that these processes could interact synergistically to increase an individual's immune burden and a population's overall morbidity. However, we find differences in the impacts of the Interoceanic highway and the Belo Monte dam on food, water, and cultural systems, and observed that community and corporate-level actions may bolster health in the face of rapid socio-ecological change. Looking at the case studies together, a complex picture of vulnerability and resilience, risk and opportunity, complicates straight-forward predictions of ecosyndemic interactions resulting from these development projects but highlights the role that the ecosyndemic concept can play in informing health impact assessments and future research. We conclude by proposing a conceptual model of the potential interactions between psychological stress, vector-borne illnesses, and sexaully-transmitted infections and suggest that future investigations of synergistic interactions among these factors draw from the biological, social, and ecological sciences.

TI  - Mosquitoes of the Jau National Park and their potential importance in Brazilian Amazonia
T2  - MEDICAL AND VETERINARY ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - An entomological inventory was conducted between 1993 and 1996 to obtain information on the diversity of mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) in the Jau National Park, State of Amazonas, Brazil. A total of 10 159 adult (91%) and immature mosquito specimens, representing 130 taxa (species + morphospecies) in 16 genera, was collected. A species list for the family Culicidae is presented, including 30 new records for the State of Amazonas. The collecting localities were restricted to the alluvial subregion of the Open Tropical Forest found in the park. Most of the specimens (71%) were collected in forest habitats and the rest in areas of second growth and peridomicile. The majority of immature specimens (46%) were collected in bodies of water along the edges of rivers, flooded forests, lakes and streams. Among the various collection methods used, the Centre for Disease Control (CDC) and Shannon traps together were responsible for capturing 60% of the adults. More than 90% of the material collected belongs to the genera Culex (65%), Psorophora (19%), Wyeomyia (4%), and Anopheles (3%), which together represent 70% of the identified taxa. The genus Culex presented the largest number of species (45). The species Culex (Melanoconion) vaxus, Cx. (Mel.) pedroi, Psorophora amazonica, Cx. (Mel.) portesi and Cx. (Mel.) theobaldi together (< 4% of the recorded species) represent more than 63% of the material collected and identified to the species level. The most abundant species was Cx. (Mel.) vaxus, representing 17% of the material identified to species. The possible epidemiological and ecological implications of the species hereby recorded in the Jau National Park are presented and discussed.

TI  - Plant-Parasitic Nematodes and Food Security in Sub-Saharan Africa
T2  - ANNUAL REVIEW OF PHYTOPATHOLOGY, VOL 56
AB  - Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is a region beset with challenges, not least its ability to feed itself. Low agricultural productivity, exploding populations, and escalating urbanization have led to declining per capita food availability. In order to reverse this trend, crop production systems must intensify, which brings with it an elevated threat from pests and diseases, including plant-parasitic nematodes. A holistic systems approach to pest management recognizes disciplinary integration. However, a critical under-representation of nematology expertise is a pivotal shortcoming, especially given the magnitude of the threat nematodes pose under more intensified systems. With more volatile climates, efficient use of water by healthy root systems is especially crucial. Within SSA, smallholder farming systems dominate the agricultural landscape, where a limited understanding of nematode problems prevails. This review provides a synopsis of current nematode challenges facing SSA and presents the opportunities to overcome current shortcomings, including a means to increase nematology capacity.

TI  - A nti-proliferative, apoptotic induction, and anti-migration effects of hemi-synthetic 1′S-1′-acetoxychavicol acetate analogs on MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells
T2  - DRUG DESIGN DEVELOPMENT AND THERAPY
AB  - Nine analogs of 1' S-1'-acetoxychavicol acetate (ACA) were hemi-synthesized and evaluated for their anticancer activities against seven human cancer cell lines. The aim of this study was to investigate the anti-proliferative, apoptotic, and anti-migration effects of these compounds and to explore the plausible underlying mechanisms of action. We found that ACA and all nine analogs were non toxic to human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) used as normal control cells, and only ACA, 1'-acetoxyeugenol acetate (AEA), and 1'-acetoxy-3,5-dimethoxychavicol acetate (AMCA) inhibited the growth of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) value of <30.0 mu M based on 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay results, and were selected for further investigation. DNA fragmentation assays showed that these three compounds markedly induced apoptosis of MDA-MB-231 cells. Western blot analysis revealed increased expression levels of cleaved PARP, p53, and Bax, while decreased expression levels of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL were seen after treatment, indicating that apoptosis was induced via the mitochondrial pathway. Moreover, ACA, AEA, and AMCA effectively inhibited the migration of MDA-MB-231 cells. They also downregulated the expression levels of pFAK/FAK and pAkt/Akt via the integrin beta 1-mediated signaling pathway. Collectively, ACA and its hemi-synthetic analogs, AEA and AMCA are seen as potential anticancer agents following their abilities to suppress growth, induce apoptosis, and inhibit migration of breast cancer cells.

TI  - Evaluation of phenolic compounds, lignin, amino acids and carbohydrates in <i>theobroma cacao</i> L. From three different climate regions in venezuela
T2  - EMIRATES JOURNAL OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE
AB  - In Venezuela, Criollo cacao crops are distributed in different regions (eastern, central and western), and under different exploitation systems, and, in each of these regions, there is a uniqueness of materials with characteristics associated to an intrinsic, differential quality that could potentially affect chocolate quality. These regions have inherent climates that are significantly different; however, there is a lack of consistent technical information about the real effects of environmental factors on the organoleptic quality of cacao. Therefore, the present work aims to evaluate the content of important components of cacao, such as phenolic compounds, lignin, amino acids, and carbohydrate, in six Theobroma cacao L clones, cultivated in three different agro-climatic locations: humid, semi-humid and dry tropical forest. It was found that production of phenolic compounds and lignin vary in clones according to their location, with the highest values found in the humid forest and the lowest in the dry climate. Non-structural carbohydrates, on the other hand, were found in greater amounts in specimens from the dry forest. The largest production of proline was found in the humid forest for most of the clones, implying that high humidity levels promote the production of amino acids, a pattern followed by phenolic compound content as well. The results presented in this study indicate that there is a climate-dependent production of important metabolites, which play an important role in the organoleptic properties of cacao, and this could potentially translate into different levels of resistance to stress and diseases.

TI  - Genetic landscape and macro-evolution of co-circulating Coxsackieviruses A and Vaccine-derived Polioviruses in the Democratic Republic of Congo, 2008-2013
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Enteroviruses (EVs) are among the most common viruses infecting humans worldwide but only a few Non-Polio Enterovirus (NPEV) isolates have been characterized in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo). Moreover, circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (PVs) [cVDPVs] isolated during multiple outbreaks in DR Congo from 2004 to 2018 have been characterized so far only by the sequences of their VP1 capsid coding gene. This study was carried to i) investigate the circulation and genetic diversity of NPEV and polio vaccine isolates recovered from healthy children and Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP) patients, ii) evaluate the occurrence of genetic recombination among EVs belonging to the Enterovirus C species (including PVs) and iii) identify the virological factors favoring multiple emergences of cVDPVs in DR Congo. The biological material considered in this study included i) a collection of 91 Sabin-like PVs, 54 cVDPVs and 150 NPEVs isolated from AFP patients between 2008 and 2012 in DR Congo and iii) a collection of 330 stool specimens collected from healthy children in 2013 in the Kasai Oriental and Maniema provinces of DR Congo. Studied virus isolates were sequenced in four distinct sub-genomic regions 5'-UTR, VP1, 2C(ATPase) and 3D(pol). Resulting sequences were compared through comparative phylogenetic analyses. Virus isolation showed that 19.1% (63/330) healthy children were infected by EVs including 17.9% (59/330) of NPEVs and 1.2% (4/330) of type 3 Sabin-like PVs. Only one EV-C type, EV-C99 was identified among the NPEV collection from AFP patients whereas 27.5% of the 69 NPEV isolates typed in healthy children belonged to the EV-C species: CV-A13 (13/69), A20 (5/69) and A17 (1/69). Interestingly, 50 of the 54 cVDPVs featured recombinant genomes containing exogenous sequences in at least one of the targeted non-structural regions of their genomes: 5'UTR, 2C(ATPase) and 3D(pol). Some of these non-vaccine sequences of the recombinant cVDPVs were strikingly related to homologous sequences from co-circulating CV-A17 and A20 in the 2C(ATPase) region as well as to those from co-circulating CV-A13, A17 and A20 in the 3D(pol) region. This study provided the first evidence uncovering CV-A20 strains as major recombination partners of PVs. High quality AFP surveillance, sensitive environmental surveillance and efficient vaccination activities remain essential to ensure timely detection and efficient response to recombinant cVDPVs outbreaks in DR Congo. Such needs are valid for any epidemiological setting where high frequency and genetic diversity of Coxsackieviruses A13, A17 and A20 provide a conducive viral ecosystem for the emergence of virulent recombinant cVDPVs.
   Author summary The strategy of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative is based on the surveillance of patients suffering from Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP) and mass vaccination with live-attenuated vaccine strains of polioviruses (PVs) in endemic areas. However, vaccine strains of PVs can circulate and replicate for a long time when the vaccine coverage of the population is low. Such prolonged circulation and replication of vaccine strains of PVs can result to the emergence of circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses [cVDPVs] that are as virulent as wild PVs. In this study, we performed the molecular characterization of a large collection of 377 virus isolates recovered from paralyzed patients between 2008 and 2012 in DR Congo and healthy children in 2013 in the Kasai Oriental and Maniema provinces of DR Congo. We found that the genetic diversity of enteroviruses of the species Enterovirus C is more important than previously reported. Interestingly, 50 of the 54 cVDPVs featured recombinant genomes containing exogenous sequences of the 2C ATPase and/or 3D polymerase coding genes acquired from co-circulating Coxsackieviruses A13, A17 and A20. Coxsackieviruses A20 strains were identified for the first time as major partners of genetic recombination with co-circulating live-attenuated polio vaccine strains. Our findings highlight the need to reinforce and maintain high quality surveillance of PVs and efficient immunization activities in order to ensure early detection and control of emerging cVDPVs in all settings where high frequency and diversity of Coxsackieviruses A13, A17 and A20 have been documented.

TI  - The prevalence of soil transmitted helminth infections in minority indigenous populations of South-East Asia and the Western Pacific Region: A systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Introduction
   Soil transmitted helminth (STH) infections cause one of the most prevalent diseases in man. STHs disproportionately impact socio-economically disadvantaged communities including minority indigenous populations. This systematic review aimed to quantify the prevalence of STH infection within minority indigenous populations of the South-East Asia and Western Pacific Regions.
   Methods
   The systematic review was conducted in accordance with The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines following a published protocol. A random effects meta-analysis was used to estimate the pooled prevalence of STH infection, and meta-regression analysis was used to quantify associations with study characteristics. Where comparative data were available, sub-group analysis was conducted to evaluate the risk of STH infection in minority indigenous people relative to other population groups. The heterogeneity between studies was evaluated visually using Forest plots and was assessed quantitatively by the index of heterogeneity (I-2) and Cochran Q-statistics.
   Results
   From 1,366 unique studies that were identified, 81 were included in the final analysis. The pooled prevalence of infection within minority indigenous populations was 61.4% (95% CI 50.8, 71.4) for overall STH infection; 32.3% (95% CI 25.7, 39.3) for Ascaris.lumbricoides; 43.6% (95% CI 32.6, 54.8) for Trichuris.trichiura; 19.9% (95% CI 15.7, 24.5) for hookworm and 6.3% (95% CI 3.2, 10.2) for Strongyloides.stercoralis. A significant increase in T. trichiura prevalence was observed over time. The stratified analysis showed that the prevalence of infection for STH overall and for each STH species were not significantly different in minority indigenous participants compared to other populations groups.
   Conclusion
   The prevalence of STH infection is high within minority indigenous populations across countries at very different levels of socio-economic development. The increasing prevalence of T. trichiura calls for the implementation of more effective therapies and control strategies.
   Author summary
   Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTD) are caused by a range of infectious pathogens and have their greatest impact on poor and vulnerable populations. One such population group, is indigenous people, who are disproportionately impacted by poverty and social disadvantage. Among the World Health Organization (WHO) list of 20 NTD, soil transmitted helminth (STH; Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura and hookworm) infections are the most prevalent and burdensome. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the prevalence of STH infection in minority indigenous populations of the South-East Asia (SEAR) and Western Pacific Regions (WPR). The results showed a high prevalence of infection for all STH species in minority indigenous populations of both developing and highly industrialized nations. Of concern was the increasing prevalence of T. trichiura infection over time, which calls for the identification and implementation of more effective therapies and control strategies. Where comparative data were available, the review showed infection prevalence of all STH species not to be significantly different in minority indigenous people compared to those of other population groups. To help break the health burden and poverty cycle created by these infections, accurate, relevant data will be required to inform effective and appropriate interventions.

TI  - Multiple introductions from multiple sources: invasion patterns for an important <i>Eucalyptus</i> leaf pathogen
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB  - Many population studies on invasive plant pathogens are undertaken without knowing the center of origin of the pathogen. Most leaf pathogens of Eucalyptus originate in Australia and consequently with indigenous populations available, and it is possible to study the pathways of invasion. Teratosphaeria suttonii is a commonly occurring leaf pathogen of Eucalyptus species, naturally distributed in tropical and subtropical regions of eastern Australia where it is regarded as a minor pathogen infecting older leaves; however, repeated infections, especially in exotic plantations, can result in severe defoliation and tree deaths. Nine polymorphic microsatellite markers were used to assess the genetic structure of 11 populations of T.suttonii of which four where from within its native range in eastern Australia and the remaining seven from exotic Eucalyptus plantations. Indigenous populations exhibited high allele and haplotype diversity, predominantly clonal reproduction, high population differentiation, and low gene flow. The diversity of the invasive populations varied widely, but in general, the younger the plantation industry in a country or region, the lower the diversity of T.suttonii. Historical gene flow was from Australia, and while self-recruitment was dominant in all populations, there was evidence for contemporary gene flow, with South Africa being the most common source and Uruguay the most common sink population. This points distinctly to human activities underlying long-distance spread of this pathogen, and it highlights lessons to be learned regarding quarantine.

TI  - Preponderance of vaccine-preventable diseases hotspots in northern Ghana: a spatial and space-time clustering analysis from 2010 to 2014
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Background Vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs) persist globally with a disproportionately high burden in Low and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs). Although this might be partly due to the failure to sustain vaccination coverage above 90% in some WHO regions, a more nuanced understanding of VPD transmission beyond vaccination coverage may unveil other important factors in VPD transmission and control. This study identified VPDs hotspots and explored their relationships with ecology, urbanicity and land-use variations (Artisanal and Small-scale Gold Mining (ASGM) activities) in Ghana. Methods District-level disease count data from 2010 to 2014 from the Ghana Health Service (GHS) and population data from the Ghana Population and Housing Census (PHC) were used to determine clustering patterns of six VPDs (Measles, Meningitis, Mumps, Otitis media, Pneumonia and Tetanus). Spatial and space-time cluster analyses were implemented in SaTScan using the discrete Poisson model. P-values were estimated using a combination of sequential Monte Carlo, standard Monte Carlo, and Gumbel approximations. Results The study found a preponderance for VPD hotspots in the northern parts of Ghana and northernmost ecological zones (Sudan Savannah and Guinea Savannah). Incidence of meningitis was higher in the Sudan Savannah ecological zone relative to: Tropical Rain Forest (p = 0.001); Semi Deciduous Forest (p < 0.0001); Transitional Zone (p < 0.0001); Coastal Savannah (p < 0.0001) and Guinea Savannah (p = 0.033). Except for mumps, which recorded a higher incidence in urban districts (p = 0.045), incidence of the other five VPDs did not differ across the urban-rural divide. Whereas spatial analysis suggested that some VPD hotspots (tetanus and otitis media) occur more frequently in mining districts in the southern part of the country, a Mann-Whitney U test revealed a higher incidence of meningitis in non-mining districts (p = 0.019). Pneumonia and meningitis recorded the highest (722.8 per 100,000) and least (0.8 per 100,000) incidence rates respectively during the study period. Conclusion This study shows a preponderance of VPD hotspots in the northern parts of Ghana and in semi-arid ecoclimates. The relationship between ASGM activities and VPD transmission in Ghana remains blurred and requires further studies with better spatial resolution to clarify.

TI  - Nodding syndrome: bridging the gap-a scoping review protocol
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Introduction Nodding syndrome (NS) is an encephalopathy of unknown origin that affects children aged between 3 and 15 years old. Cases have been reported since the 1950 in Tanzania and South Sudan, the most heavily affected population is the Acholi community in Uganda. In response to the high incidence of the disease, the Ugandan Government has developed a management algorithm, but access to such measures in affected communities is limited. There is little funding for research on the disease, consequently, few studies have been conducted to date. Nevertheless, the number of scientific publications onNShas increased since 2013, reporting several aetiological hypotheses, management algorithms and cases of stigmatisation; however, none has obtained conclusive results. This document describes a protocol for a scoping review ofNSto date aimed at obtaining a broad overview of the disease. The results will identify gaps in knowledge in order to better guide future research, intervention strategies, health policies in areas at risk and cooperation and development programmes. Methods and analysis To identify the relevant data, we will conduct a literature search using the electronic databases PubMed/Medline, Embase, Social Science Citation Index Scopus, Scientific Electronic Library Online (SciELO), Literatura Latinoamericana y del Caribe en Ciencias de la Salud (LILACS), Social Science Citation Index Expanded and The Cochrane Library. We will also include grey literature. The search strategy will be designed by a librarian. Two members of the team will work independently to identify studies for inclusion and perform data extraction. The search results will be assessed by two independent reviewers and data from the included studies will be charted and summarised in duplicate. The data will be summarised in tables and figures to present the research landscape and describe and map gaps. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval is not required. The scoping review will adhere to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews andMeta-Analyses-ScR guidelines. The results will be disseminated at scientific congresses and meetings.

TI  - Hospital admissions due to snake envenomation in the Republic of Cyprus: a 7-year retrospective review
T2  - JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL MEDICINE AND TOXICOLOGY
AB  - Background: Snake envenomation is a major neglected tropical disease, lacking data in many countries including Cyprus, a Mediterranean island inhabited by the medically important blunt-nosed viper (Macrovipera lebetina). Reviewing the 2013-2019 period, we present first-time epidemiological snakebite data in the Republic of Cyprus. Methods: We obtained data on snake envenomation-related hospital admissions from the Ministry of Health, and population and rainfall data from the Statistical Service of Cyprus and Department of Meteorology websites. Human-viper conflict information was acquired from interviews with 12 representatives of Cypriot institutions. Results: Between 2013 and 2019, 288 snake envenomation cases were admitted to public hospitals, averaging 41 people annually. The minimum was 29 cases (2017) and the maximum was 58 (2015). Snake envenomation incidence increased from 4.55 per 100,000 population (2013) to 6.84 (2015), but remained low since 2017 (3.49 in 2019). Between 2000 and 2018, the deaths of one man (73 years), and indirectly, one woman (77 years), were related to snake envenomation. While 266 cases (92%) happened between April and October (the blunt-nosed viper activity period), most envenomations occurred in September (cumulative for 2013-2019), with 88 cases (31%). Snakebite incidence peaked in the 60-69 years age group (9.19 per 100,000 population), and was higher in males (6.85) than in females (2.82). Of all admitted patients, 242 (84%) were discharged within 4 days. Mean hospital stay duration was 2.65 days, with one case of 13 days. Most patients were admitted to the general hospitals in Paphos (51%), Limassol (30%) and Nicosia (11%), which provide secondary healthcare, with the last one providing tertiary healthcare. Conclusions: Snakebite-related deaths are very rare in the Republic of Cyprus. Most envenomation cases happened in late summer (September). Short hospital stays indicate mostly non-severe clinical courses. The hospital admission data suggest that snake envenomation risk is highest in Paphos district. The statistical data hint at males and middle- to older-aged people being at highest risk, whereas from our interview data we assume that outdoor workers are at higher risk than other occupational groups.

TI  - Asymptotic distribution of density-dependent stage-grouped population dynamics models
T2  - ACTA BIOTHEORETICA
AB  - Matrix models are widely used in biology to predict the temporal evolution of stage-structured populations. One issue related to matrix models that is often disregarded is the sampling variability. As the sample used to estimate the vital rates of the models are of finite size, a sampling error is attached to parameter estimation, which has in turn repercussions on all the predictions of the model. In this study, we address the question of building confidence bounds around the predictions of matrix models due to sampling variability. We focus on a density-dependent Usher model, the maximum likelihood estimator of parameters, and the predicted stationary stage vector. The asymptotic distribution of the stationary stage vector is specified, assuming that the parameters of the model remain in a set of the parameter space where the model admits one unique equilibrium point. Tests for density-dependence are also incidentally provided. The model is applied to a tropical rain forest in French Guiana.

TI  - Molecular Differentiation of the African Yellow Fever Vector <i>Aedes bromeliae</i> (<i>Diptera: Culicidae</i>) from Its Sympatric Nonvector Sister Species, <i>Aedes lilii</i>
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Introduction
   Yellow fever continues to be a problem in sub-Saharan Africa with repeated epidemics occurring. The mosquito Aedes bromeliae is a major vector of yellow fever, but it cannot be readily differentiated from its non-vector zoophilic sister species Ae. lilii using morphological characters. Genetic differences have been reported between anthropophilic Ae. bromeliae and zoophilic Ae. lilii and between forest and domestic populations. However, due to the application of different molecular markers and non-overlapping populations employed in previous studies, interpretation of species delimitation is unclear.
   Methodology/Principle Findings
   DNA sequences were generated from specimens of Ae. simpsoni s. l. from the Republic of Benin, Tanzania and Uganda for two nuclear genes apolipophorin 2 (apoLp2) and cytochrome p450 (CYPJ92), the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) and the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (COI) barcoding region. Nuclear genes apoLp2 and CYPJ92 were unable to differentiate between species Ae. bromeliae and Ae. lilii due to ancestral lineage sorting, while ITS sequence data provided clear topological separation on a phylogeny. The standard COI barcoding region was shown to be subject to species introgression and unable to clearly distinguish the two taxa. Here we present a reliable direct PCR-based method for differentiation of the vector species Ae. bromeliae from its isomorphic, sympatric and non-biomedically important sister taxon, Ae. lilii, based on the ITS region. Using molecular species verification, we describe novel immature habitats for Ae. lilii and report both sympatric and allopatric populations. Whereas only Ae. lilii is found in the Republic of Benin and only Ae. bromeliae in Tanzania, both species are sympatric in Uganda.
   Conclusions/Significance
   Our accurate identification method will allow informed distribution and detailed ecological studies that will facilitate assessment of arboviral disease risk and development of future targeted vector control.

TI  - Nestedness patterns of sand fly (Diptera: Psychodidae) species in a neotropical semi-arid environment
T2  - ACTA TROPICA
AB  - A common pattern in neotropical Leishmania spp. transmission is the co-occurrence of several sand fly (SF) species at endemic foci. We collected 13 SF spp. by direct aspiration in natural resting places (NRP) and 10 SF spp. with Shannon traps (ST), totaling 15 spp. with both methods, at 6 locations within a semi-arid region with endemic visceral leishmaniasis transmission in Falcon State, Northwestern Venezuela. We used null model testing of species co-occurrence and nestedness metrics estimated with our field data to ask whether SF species composition was segregated/aggregated, and if aggregated whether there was nestedness, i.e., whether species composition across sampling locations could be described by ordered subsets of species from the most species rich location in a landscape. Results showed that SF species were aggregated (P < 0.05), i.e., most species were present in species rich locations. Similarly, SF species were significantly nested (P < 0.05). Differences in pairwise Sorensen and Simpson indices, estimated with the ST data and the combined ST and NRP data, were positively associated with the distance between sampling locations, suggesting that species nestedness might be partially shaped by dispersal limitation. Our data showed that three species of medical importance were common across the sampling locations: Lutzomyia gomezi, Lutzomyia panamensis and Lutzomyia evansi, suporting that vector species do not turnover in the studied setting.

TI  - Predicting suitable habitats of <i>Melia azedarach</i> L. in China using data mining
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Melia azedarach L. is an important economic tree widely distributed in tropical and subtropical regions of China and some other countries. However, it is unclear how the species' suitable habitat will respond to future climate changes. We aimed to select the most accurate one among seven data mining models to predict the current and future suitable habitats for M. azedarach in China. These models include: maximum entropy (MaxEnt), support vector machine (SVM), generalized linear model (GLM), random forest (RF), naive bayesian model (NBM), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and gradient boosting machine (GBM). A total of 906 M. azedarach locations were identified, and sixteen climate predictors were used for model building. The models' validity was assessed using three measures (Area Under the Curves (AUC), kappa, and overall accuracy (OA)). We found that the RF provided the most outstanding performance in prediction power and generalization capacity. The top climate factors affecting the species' suitable habitats were mean coldest month temperature (MCMT), followed by the number of frost-free days (NFFD), degree-days above 18 degrees C (DD > 18), temperature difference between MWMT and MCMT, or continentality (TD), mean annual precipitation (MAP), and degree-days below 18 degrees C (DD < 18). We projected that future suitable habitat of this species would increase under both the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios for the 2011-2040 (2020s), 2041-2070 (2050s), and 2071-2100 (2080s). Our findings are expected to assist in better understanding the impact of climate change on the species and provide scientific basis for its planting and conservation.

T2  - FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Alchornea laxiflora (Benth.) Pax & K. Hoffm. (Euphorbiaceae) is an important traditional medicinal plant grown in tropical Africa. The stem, leaves, and root have been widely used in the folk medicine systems in Nigeria, Cameroon, South Africa, and Ghana to treat various ailments, including inflammatory, infectious, and central nervous system disorders, such as anxiety and epilepsy.Material and methods: The scientific name of the plant was validated using the "The Plant List, " "Kew Royal Botanic Gardens, " and Tropicos Nomenclatural databases. The literature search on A. laxiflora was performed using electronic search engines and databases such as Google scholar, ScienceDirect, PubMed, AJOL, Scopus, and Mendeley.Results: To the best of our knowledge, no specific and detailed review has been reported on A. laxiflora. Consequently, this review provides an up-to-date systematic presentation on ethnobotany, phytoconstituents, pharmacological activities, and toxicity profiles of A. laxiflora. Phytochemical investigations disclosed the presence of important compounds, such as alkaloids, flavonoids, phenolics, terpenoids, and fatty acids. Furthermore, various pharmacological activities and traditional uses reported for this botanical drug were discussed comprehensively.Conclusion: This systemic review presents the current status and perspectives of A. laxiflora as a potential therapeutic modality that would assist future researchers in exploring this African botanical drug as a source of novel drug candidates for varied diseases.

TI  - Quantifying geographic accessibility to improve efficiency of entomological monitoring
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   Vector-borne diseases are important causes of mortality and morbidity in humans and livestock, particularly for poorer communities and countries in the tropics. Large-scale programs against these diseases, for example malaria, dengue and African trypanosomiasis, include vector control, and assessing the impact of this intervention requires frequent and extensive monitoring of disease vector abundance. Such monitoring can be expensive, especially in the later stages of a successful program where numbers of vectors and cases are low.
   Methodology/Principal findings
   We developed a system that allows the identification of monitoring sites where pre-intervention densities of vectors are predicted to be high, and travel cost to sites is low, highlighting the most efficient locations for longitudinal monitoring. Using remotely sensed imagery and an image classification algorithm, we mapped landscape resistance associated with on- and off-road travel for every gridded location (3m and 0.5m grid cells) within Koboko district, Uganda. We combine the accessibility surface with pre-existing estimates of tsetse abundance and propose a stratified sampling approach to determine the most efficient locations for longitudinal data collection. Our modelled predictions were validated against empirical measurements of travel-time and existing maps of road networks. We applied this approach in northern Uganda where a large-scale vector control program is being implemented to control human African trypanosomiasis, a neglected tropical disease (NTD) caused by trypanosomes transmitted by tsetse flies. Our accessibility surfaces indicate a high performance when compared to empirical data, with remote sensing identifying a further similar to 70% of roads than existing networks.
   Conclusions/Significance By integrating such estimates with predictions of tsetse abundance, we propose a methodology to determine the optimal placement of sentinel monitoring sites for evaluating control programme efficacy, moving from a nuanced, ad-hoc approach incorporating intuition, knowledge of vector ecology and local knowledge of geographic accessibility, to a reproducible, quantifiable one.
   Author summary
   Assessing the impact of vector control programmes requires longitudinal measurements of the abundance of insect vectors within intervention areas. Such monitoring can be expensive, especially in the later stages of a successful program where numbers of vectors and cases of disease are low. Efficient monitoring involves a prior selection of monitoring sites that are easy to reach and produce rich information on vector abundance. Here, we used image classification and cost-distance algorithms to produce estimates of accessibility within Koboko district, Uganda, where vector control is contributing to the elimination of sleeping sickness, a neglected tropical disease (NTD). We combine an accessibility surface with pre-existing estimates of tsetse abundance and propose a stratified sampling approach to determine locations which are associated with low cost (lowest travel time) and potential for longitudinal data collection (high pre-intervention abundance). Our method could be adapted for use in the planning and monitoring of tsetse- and other vector-control programmes. By providing methods to ensure that vector control programmes operate at maximum efficiency, we can ensure that the limited funding associated with some of these NTDs has the largest impact.

TI  - The First Human Epitope Map of the Alphaviral E1 and E2 Proteins Reveals a New E2 Epitope with Significant Virus Neutralizing Activity
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background: Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) is responsible for VEE epidemics that occur in South and Central America and the U.S. The VEEV envelope contains two glycoproteins E1 (mediates cell membrane fusion) and E2 (binds receptor and elicits virus neutralizing antibodies). Previously we constructed E1 and E2 epitope maps using murine monoclonal antibodies (mMAbs). Six E2 epitopes (E2(c,d,e,f,g,h)) bound VEEV-neutralizing antibody and mapped to amino acids (aa) 182-207. Nothing is known about the human antibody repertoire to VEEV or epitopes that engage human virus-neutralizing antibodies. There is no specific treatment for VEE; however virus-neutralizing mMAbs are potent protective and therapeutic agents for mice challenged with VEEV by either peripheral or aerosol routes. Therefore, fully human MAbs (hMAbs) with virus-neutralizing activity should be useful for prevention or clinical treatment of human VEE.
   Methods: We used phage-display to isolate VEEV-specific hFabs from human bone marrow donors. These hFabs were characterized by sequencing, specificity testing, VEEV subtype cross-reactivity using indirect ELISA, and in vitro virus neutralization capacity. One E2-specific neutralizing hFAb, F5n, was converted into IgG, and its binding site was identified using competitive ELISA with mMAbs and by preparing and sequencing antibody neutralization-escape variants.
   Findings: Using 11 VEEV-reactive hFabs we constructed the first human epitope map for the alphaviral surface proteins E1 and E2. We identified an important neutralization-associated epitope unique to the human immune response, E2 aa115-119. Using a 9 angstrom resolution cryo-electron microscopy map of the Sindbis virus E2 protein, we showed the probable surface location of this human VEEV epitope.
   Conclusions: The VEEV-neutralizing capacity of the hMAb F5 nIgG is similar to that exhibited by the humanized mMAb Hy4 IgG. The Hy4 IgG has been shown to limit VEEV infection in mice both prophylactically and therapeutically. Administration of a cocktail of F5n and Hy4 IgGs, which bind to different E2 epitopes, could provide enhanced prophylaxis or immunotherapy for VEEV, while reducing the possibility of generating possibly harmful virus neutralization-escape variants in vivo.

TI  - Phylogenetic and geographical relationships of hantavirus strains in eastern and western Paraguay
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Recently, we reported the discovery of several potential rodent reservoirs of hantaviruses in western (Holochilus chacarius) and eastern Paraguay (Akodon montensis, Oligoryzomys chacoensis, and O. nigripes). Comparisons of the hantavirus S- and M-segments amplified from these four rodents revealed significant differences from each another and from other South American hantaviruses. The ALP strain from the semiarid Chaco ecoregion clustered with Leguna Negra and Rio Mamore (LN/RM), whereas the BMJ-NEB strain from the more humid lower Chaco ecoregion formed a clade with Oran and Bermejo. The other two strains, AAI and IP37/38, were distinct from known hantaviruses. With respect to the S-segment sequence, AAI from eastern Paraguay formed a clade with ALP/LN/RM, but its M-segment clustered with Pergamino and Maciel, suggesting a possible reassortment. AAI was found in areas experiencing, rapid land cover fragmentation and change within the Interior Atlantic Forest. IP37/38 did not show any strong association with any of the known hantavirus strains.

TI  - Testing the waters: Syndemic gastrointestinal distress in Lambar′en′e, Gabon, 1926-1932
T2  - SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE
AB  - This paper argues that a cluster of pathogens, hazardous labor conditions, and environmental constraints rendered chronic gastrointestinal distress fatal for African laborers living near Lambare ' ne ', Gabon during the 1920s. Application of syndemic theory and epidemiological methods on patient records at Hospital Schweitzer, the central hospital of the region, explain how a seemingly simple diagnosis of chronic gastrointestinal distress belied a complex web of worsening biological and social outcomes for laborers in the tropical forests of central Gabon. An analysis of the syndemic suffering of GI patients reveals how the dysentery pathogen became tied to the peaks and valleys of the colonial economy, and in particular, the colonial extraction of tropical hardwoods. These processes culminated in the summer of 1929 when the highest number of timber exports coincided with the deadliest months of dysentery outbreak for the patient population at Hospital Schweitzer. This case study proposes syndemics as an effective theoretical framework to research historical precedents of the entanglement of people, pathogens, and illness.

TI  - The Spatial-Temporal Distribution of Chronic Lymphatic Filariasis in Indonesia: A 18-Year Registry-Based Analysis
T2  - MICROBIOLOGY RESEARCH
AB  - Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a vector-borne disease caused by parasitic helminths and constitutes a serious public health issue in tropical regions. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), infected cases in Southeast Asia constitute 50% of the estimated 120 million infections globally. In Indonesia, LF is caused by all filarial species, and in 2018, 236 districts of a total of 514 districts in the entire country were declared as endemic areas. The global program to eliminate filariasis has been running for the last 19 years and has been conducted as a full national initiative for the last eight years in Indonesia. The study describes the surveillance of LF cases and prevalence in Indonesia for the past 17 years (2001-2017)-during the global and national LF elimination programs-using national registry-based data. The data demonstrate that the national program has been largely effective in the areas it has been active the longest, while there are provinces lagging behind in the successful suppression of LF. The high geographical fragmentation of the country, with the associated ecological parameters relating to LF incidence, likely play an important role in maintaining the highly varied incidence rate across Indonesia.

TI  - Boreal carbon loss due to poleward shift in low-carbon ecosystems
T2  - NATURE GEOSCIENCE
AB  - Climate change can be thought of in terms of geographical shifts in climate properties. Examples include assessments of shifts in habitat distributions(1), of the movement needed to maintain constant temperature or precipitation(2), and of the emergence and disappearance of climate zones(3). Here I track the movement of analogue climates within climate models. From the model simulations, I define a set of vectors that link a historical reference climate for each location to the location in a changed climate whose seasonal temperature and precipitation cycles best match the reference climate. I use these vectors to calculate the change in vegetation carbon storage with climate change due to ecosystems following climate analogues. Comparing the derived carbon content change to direct carbon projections by coupled carbon-climate models reveals two regions of divergence. In the tropical forests, vector projections are fundamentally uncertain because of a lack of close climatic analogues. In the southern boreal forest, carbon losses are projected in the vector perspective because low-carbon ecosystems shift polewards. However, the majority of carbon-climate models-typically without explicit simulation of the disturbance and mortality processes behind such shifts-instead project vegetation carbon gains throughout the boreal region. Southern boreal carbon loss as a result of ecosystem shift is likely to offset carbon gains from northern boreal forest expansion.

TI  - Current challenges and implications for dengue, chikungunya and Zika seroprevalence studies worldwide: A scoping review
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   Arboviral infections are a public health concern and an escalating problem worldwide. Estimating the burden of these diseases represents a major challenge that is complicated by the large number of unapparent infections, especially those of dengue fever. Serological surveys are thus required to identify the distribution of these diseases and measure their impact. Therefore, we undertook a scoping review of the literature to describe and summarize epidemiological practices, findings and insights related to seroprevalence studies of dengue, chikungunya and Zika virus, which have rapidly expanded across the globe in recent years.
   Methodology/Principal findings
   Relevant studies were retrieved through a literature search of MEDLINE, WHOLIS, Lilacs, SciELO and Scopus (2000 to 2018). In total, 1389 publications were identified. Studies addressing the seroprevalence of dengue, chikungunya and/or Zika written in English or French and meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria were included. In total, 147 studies were included, from which 185 data points were retrieved, as some studies used several different samples. Most of the studies were exclusively conducted on dengue (66.5%), but 16% were exclusively conducted on chikungunya, and 7 were exclusively conducted on Zika; the remainder were conducted on multiple arboviruses. A wide range of designs were applied, but most studies were conducted in the general population (39%) and in households (41%). Although several assays were used, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) were the predominant test used (77%). The temporal distribution of chikungunya studies followed the virus during its rapid expansion since 2004. The results revealed heterogeneity of arboviruses seroprevalence between continents and within a given country for dengue, chikungunya and Zika viruses, ranging from 0 to 100%, 76% and 73% respectively.
   Conclusions/Significance
   Serological surveys provide the most direct measurement for defining the immunity landscape for infectious diseases, but the methodology remains difficult to implement. Overall, dengue, chikungunya and Zika serosurveys followed the expansion of these arboviruses, but there remain gaps in their geographic distribution. This review addresses the challenges for researchers regarding study design biases. Moreover, the development of reliable, rapid and affordable diagnosis tools represents a significant issue concerning the ability of sero-prevalence surveys to differentiate infections when multiple viruses co-circulate.

TI  - Oropouche virus transmission in the Amazon River basin of Peru
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Seroepidemiologic studies were conducted to determine the prevalence of Oropouche (ORO) viral antibody, risk factors, and the incidence of infection among residents of the Amazon region of Peru. Blood samples, as well as demographic, cultural, and medical history data, were collected from residents in a sector of the city of Iquitos and in an adjacent rural and three neotropical rain forest communities. Blood specimens were obtained approximately one year later from a cohort of the same study subjects who were negative for ORO antibody on the initial cross-sectional survey. Sera were tested for ORO IgG antibody by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Antibody prevalences were 35% for residents of the urban population, 24-46% for the forest communities, and 18% for the rural community. Antibody prevalence increased with age, and subjects who were seropositive were significantly (P = 0.001) older (mean = 33 years) than the seronegative subjects (mean = 15 years). Multivariate analysis revealed that only age, urban and forest residence, and occupation as a farmer or housekeeper remained significantly associated with seropositivity. Seroconversion data for the same populations one year later demonstrated evidence of ORO viral infection among 28% of the residents in the rural community and 2% or less in the forest and urban communities. Oropouche virus infection was significantly associated with older age (P = 0.04) in the rural community (P < 0.001). These data support prior evidence of ORO viral infection among residents of Iquitos and surrounding villages and suggest that transmission of this virus occurs continuously in the population of this area of the Amazon basin.

TI  - A Silent Enzootic of an Orthopoxvirus in Ghana, West Africa: Evidence for Multi-Species Involvement in the Absence of Widespread Human Disease
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Human monkeypox has never been reported in Ghana, but rodents captured in forested areas of southern Ghana were the source of the monkeypox virus introduced into the United States in 2003. Subsequent to the outbreak in the United States, 204 animals were collected from two commercial trapping sites in Ghana. Animal tissues were examined for the presence of orthopoxvirus (OPXV) DNA using a real-time polymerase chain reaction, and sera were assayed for antibodies against OPXV. Animals from five genera (Cricetomys, Graphiurus, Funiscirus, and Heliosciurus) had antibodies against OPXV, and three genera (Cricetomys, Graphiurus, and Xerus) had evidence of OPXV DNA in tissues. Additionally, 172 persons living near the trapping sites were interviewed regarding risk factors for OPXV exposure, and their sera were analyzed. Fifty-three percent had IgG against OPXV; none had IgM. Our findings suggest that several species of forest-dwelling rodents from Ghana are susceptible to naturally occurring OPXV infection, and that persons living near forests may have low-level or indirect exposure to OPXV-infected animals, possibly resulting in sub-clinical infections.

TI  - Catastrophic population declines and extinctions in neotropical harlequin frogs (Bufonidae: <i>Atelopus</i>)
T2  - BIOTROPICA
AB  - We surveyed the population status of the Neotropical toad genus Atelopus, and document recent catastrophic declines that are more severe than previously reported for any amphibian genus. Of 113 species that have been described or are candidates for description, data indicate that in 42 species, population sizes have been reduced by at least half and only ten species have stable populations. The status of the remaining taxa is unknown. At least 30 species have been missing from all known localities for at least 8 yr and are feared extinct. Most of these species were last seen between 1984 and 1996. All species restricted to elevations of above 1000 m have declined and 75 percent have disappeared, while 58 percent of lowland species have declined and 38 percent have disappeared. Habitat loss was not related to declines once we controlled for the effects of elevation. In fact, 22 species that occur in protected areas have disappeared. The fungal disease Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis has been documented from nine species that have declined, and may explain declines in higher elevation species that occur in undisturbed habitats. Climate change may also play a role, but other potential factors such as environmental contamination, trade, and introduced species are unlikely to have affected more than a handful of species. Widespread declines and extinctions in Atelopus may reflect population changes in other Neotropical amphibians that are more difficult to survey, and the loss of this trophic group may have cascading effects on other species in tropical ecosystems.

TI  - Random and systematic land-cover transitions in northern Ghana
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - The objective of this paper is to detect the dominant landscape changes in a 5400 km(2) area in northern Ghana. An in-depth analysis of the conventional transition matrix was used to separate landscape transformations to random and systematic transitions. A landscape transition is random if a land-cover category gains from other categories in proportion to the availability of those other losing categories, or if a category loses to other categories in proportion to the size of those other gaining categories. Any large deviation from those proportions is refer-red to as systematic transition. The highest systematic transition involved the conversion of about 12% of landscape from grassland to cropland. Other systematic landscape transitions included degradation of closed woodland to open woodland (11% of landscape), gain in biomass from open woodland to closed woodland (8% of landscape), and the degradation of open woodland to grassland (6% of landscape). The vulnerability of grassland to transition to cropland probably reflects the ease of clearing grassland compared to other natural vegetation. Cropland systematically avoided gaining from woodland and woodland systematically avoided losing to cropland, suggesting that woodcutting for charcoal and firewood collection is the major proximate cause of decline in woodland. Most of the random landscape transitions occurred in areas affected by spontaneous occupation by migrants, peri-urban cropland expansion as a result of displacement of farmers, and the resettlement of households along the White Volta River after the eradication of water-borne diseases. It is essential to combine systematic and random landscape change analyses for improved understanding of the processes of land use change. This will help in linking patterns to processes and in designing policy interventions aimed at reducing the unfavorable effects of dramatic land change. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Different approaches for modeling <i>Swietenia macrophylla</i> commercial volume in an Amazon agroforestry system
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB  - The agroforestry systems (AFS) in the Amazon stand out in the national and international scenario due to the possibility of cultivating tropical forest species of high commercial value as the Brazilian mahogany, concomitantly, has sought to use more robust approaches to quantifying timber volume that does not require the same assumptions as traditional approaches. In this context, this study aimed to develop volumetric equations, by traditional approaches, by mixed modeling, and by machine learning techniques, that accurately estimate the commercial volume of Brazilian mahogany trees in an AFS in Amazon as well as verify whether there are differences in the estimates of these approaches by univariate analysis. For that, 108 trees were sampled in 36 circular plots of 500 m(2) to estimate the commercial volume. Volumetric equations were developed from the fit of the Schumacher and Hall volumetric model and Kozak taper, by nonlinear regression, from the application of nonlinear mixed modeling in the most precise traditional model and training of artificial neural network (ANN) and supporting vector machines. The analysis of variance indicated that there was no significant difference between the mean values estimated by the equations developed by the different approaches tested in the inventoried individual data. Nevertheless, it is recommended to use the equation generated by ANN to perform estimations in other populations, because it presented more precise estimates in the test set.

TI  - A Novel Spirooxindole Derivative Inhibits the Growth of <i>Leishmania</i> <i>donovani</i> Parasites both <i>In Vitro</i> and <i>In Vivo</i> by Targeting Type IB Topoisomerase
T2  - ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS AND CHEMOTHERAPY
AB  - Visceral leishmaniasis is a fatal parasitic disease, and there is an emergent need for development of effective drugs against this neglected tropical disease. Wereport here the development of a novel spirooxindole derivative, N-benzyl-2,2'alpha-3,3', 5', 6', 7', 7 alpha,alpha'-octahydro-2methoxycarbonyl- spiro[indole-3,3'-pyrrolizidine]-2-one (compound 4c), which inhibits Leishmania donovani topoisomerase IB (LdTopIB) and kills the wild type as well as drug-resistant parasite strains. This compound inhibits catalytic activity of LdTopIB in a competitive manner. Unlike camptothecin (CPT), the compound does not stabilize the DNA-topoisomerase IB cleavage complex; rather, it hinders drug-DNA-enzyme covalent complex formation. Fluorescence studies show that the stoichiometry of this compound binding to LdTopIB is 2: 1 (mole/mole), with a dissociation constant of 6.65 mu M. Molecular docking with LdTopIB using the stereoisomers of compound 4c produced two probable hits for the binding site, one in the small subunit and the other in the hinge region of the large subunit of LdTopIB. This spirooxindole is highly cytotoxic to promastigotes of L. donovani and also induces apoptosis-like cell death in the parasite. Treatment with compound 4c causes depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential, formation of reactive oxygen species inside parasites, and ultimately fragmentation of nuclear DNA. Compound 4c also effectively clears amastigote forms of wild-type and drug-resistant parasites from infected mouse peritoneal macrophages but has less of an effect on host macrophages. Moreover, compound 4c showed strong antileishmanial efficacies in the BALB/c mouse model of leishmaniasis. This compound potentially can be used as a lead for developing excellent antileishmanial agents against emerging drug-resistant strains of the parasite.

TI  - Spatial distribution patterns of tick community structure in sympatric jaguars (<i>Panthera onca</i>) and pumas (<i>Puma concolor</i>) from three ecoregions in Mexico
T2  - MEDICAL AND VETERINARY ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - We examined tick communities on wild felid hosts in three ecoregions of Mexico. We collected 186 ticks of 7 species from 10 pumas (Puma concolor) and 9 jaguars (Panthera onca). Tick community composition varied across the ecoregions, and across host species within each region. Overall, Ixodes affinis, Amblyomma ovale, and Amblyomma tenellum were the most abundant species; however, only the latter two ticks were distributed across all three ecoregions, while I. affinis, along with Ixodes spinipalpis, Amblyomma inornatum, and Amblyomma parvum were restricted to more limited geographical regions. Ixodes affinis occurred strictly in southern tropical rainforest ecoregions and was significantly more abundant in Selva Lacandona compared with the Yucatan Peninsula. Amblyomma ovale was significantly more common in the tropical dry forest in the Pacific coastal ecoregion. Amblyomma tenellum abundance tended to be higher on jaguars, while I. affinis abundance was higher on pumas. Regional distribution patterns of some tick species (e.g., I. affinis and I. spinipalpis) may be determined by off-host environmental conditions rather than host factors. In contrast, at the local scale, occurrence and abundance of some tick species (e.g., A. tenellum, A. ovale and Rhipicephalus microplus) might be driven by ecological-host factors, such as habitat use or predator-prey relationships.

T2  - TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Background: There are an estimated one million patients with scrub typhus in the Asia-Pacific region. There are few reports describing the incidence of scrub typhus in Vietnam. Methods: Blood samples collected from 63 patients clinically diagnosed as having scrub typhus from July 2015 to September 2016 were subjected to genotyping of Orientia tsutsugamushi. Results and Conclusions: Of these patients, 42 (67%) tested positive for O. tsutsugamushi, and the most common genotype was identified to be Karp (55%). Other genotypes, TA763, Gilliam type in Japan variant, and Kato were also found in 17%, 17% and 12% of patients, respectively. To better understand the epidemiological landscape of scrub typhus in Vietnam, a countrywide study is needed.

TI  - <i>Plasmodium knowlesi</i> infecting humans in Southeast Asia: What's next?
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Plasmodium knowlesi, a simian malaria parasite, has been in the limelight since a large focus of human P. knowlesi infection was reported from Sarawak (Malaysian Borneo) in 2004. Although this infection is transmitted across Southeast Asia, the largest number of cases has been reported from Malaysia. The increasing number of knowlesi malaria cases has been attributed to the use of molecular tools for detection, but environmental changes including deforestation likely play a major role by increasing human exposure to vector mosquitoes, which coexist with the macaque host. In addition, with the reduction in human malaria transmission in Southeast Asia, it is possible that human populations are at a greater risk of P. knowlesi infection due to diminishing cross-species immunity. Furthermore, the possibility of increasing exposure of humans to other simian Plasmodium parasites such as Plasmodium cynomolgi and Plasmodium inui should not be ignored. We here review the current status of these parasites in humans, macaques, and mosquitoes to support necessary reorientation of malaria control and elimination in the affected areas.

TI  - Taxonomic affiliation influences the selection of medicinal plants among people from semi-arid and humid regions-a proposition for the evaluation of utilitarian equivalence in Northeast Brazil
T2  - PEERJ
AB  - Background: This study sought to investigate the occurrence of taxonomic patterns between semi-arid and humid regions, verifying how the taxonomic affiliation can influence the selection of plants for medicinal purposes and act as a selection criterion.
   Methods: The relationship between the taxonomic affiliation and the selection of medicinal plants with four different communities was analyzed; two of them associated with a seasonally dry tropical forest and the other two associated with a tropical rain forest. We used the Utilitarian Equivalence Model (transposing the concept of ecological equivalence, proposed by Odum, for ethnobotany) to test the hypothesis that species that have the same taxonomic affiliation tend to have the same therapeutic applications in different environments (utilitarian equivalence). In addition, we used the Utilitarian Redundancy Model to verify whether, within the same medical system, plants of the same taxonomic affiliation tend to be redundant (treating the same diseases).
   Results: We found that a pair of plants of the same genus were 9.25 times more likely to be equivalent than a different genus pair (OR = 9.25, CI [1.68-51.02], p < 0.05). When we analyzed the species used by the same population, the chances of a pair having similar therapeutic uses (utilitarian redundancy) increased when they were species of the same family (OR = 1.94, CI [1.06-3.53]; p < 0.05).
   Conclusions: These findings confirm the hypothesis that there is an influence of taxonomic affiliation, in terms of genera and family, on the selection of medicinal plants in semi-arid and humid areas in Northeast Brazil. In addition, our Utilitarian Equivalence Model can be an important tool in the search for more common selection criteria, in order to identify the shared characteristics among the equivalent pairs and consequently the main types of perceptions or stimuli that led to the inclusion of such species in local pharmacopoeias.

TI  - Assessing human-bat interactions around a protected area in northeastern Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY AND ETHNOMEDICINE
AB  - Background: Bats are key components to the Neotropical forests. Unfortunately, their bad reputation is a major obstacle in their conservation as it creates fear and hostility towards them. Understanding this reputation acquired by bats and studying interactions between bats and humans has shown fundamental promise when creating strategies to forge a non-antagonistic coexistence between both parts and in the promotion of bat conservation in areas with ever-rising human occupation.
   Methods: Ninety people were surveyed from three villages that were situated around a Biological Reserve in the state of Paraiba; located in Northern Brazil. The survey was completed using semi-structured interviews addressing villager's knowledge of the biology and ecology of bats, their interactions with bats, potential medicinal uses, and their socioeconomic situation. Additionally, we sampled the bats that reside in or visit these villages.
   Results: Bats were often considered harmful, dangerous and carriers of disease. Bats were often connected to hematophagia, as well. The respondents believe that impacts such as the deforestation are forcing bats into urban environments. With this research, we were able to register one of the few records of bats in popular medicine in Brazil.
   Conclusion: The folklore and superstition surrounding bats can form an obstacle that affects their conservation. Environmental education is an important step in order to create a harmonious coexistence between humans and bats and to mitigate the impending conflicts between humanity and nature.

TI  - Relationship between agronomic factors and level of damage by red squirrels to cocoa pods in the Cordillera de Merida, Venezuela
T2  - REVISTA DE LA FACULTAD DE AGRONOMIA DE LA UNIVERSIDAD DEL ZULIA
AB  - Cocoa is a tropical crop of great economic and ecological importance, with great potential in Venezuela, where fungal diseases and squirrels, affect its productivity. The objective of the work was to analyze the relationship between the level of damage and some agronomic and environmental variables in 39 production of the state of Merida. The types of cocoa present were classified as criollo, forastero and hybrid. The damage percentages were transformed to arcsine and grouped into subjective categories according to the variables; the relationship was statistically analyzed using non-parametric tests: Kruskal-Wallis, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, and Moses, assuming alpha= 0.05. The level of damage was not statistically different (p> 0.05) between the crops located at different altitudes. The same occurred with the variables cocoa lot size, planting density, number of cultivars, level of agrochemicals, type of vegetation surrounding the crop, and distance to the forest. But the level of damage was statistically different (p< 0.05) between the production units that differed in the number of associated crops. The level of damage was also statistically different according to the number of shade trees.ha(-1) and among those that differed with respect to the presence/ absence of alternative fruits. It is concluded that the structural complexity of the crops functions as an integrating element in determining the level of damage caused by squirrels and defines the suitability of their habitat.

TI  - How rare is rare? Quantifying and assessing the rarity of the bush dog <i>Speothos venaticus</i> across the Amazon and other biomes
T2  - ORYX
AB  - The bush dog Speothos venaticus is a medium-sized Neotropical canid. It is considered to be rare and its biology and population parameters are still poorly understood. The Amazon is one of the main strongholds of this species and is important for maintaining viable populations, as the region still holds extensive tracts of pristine habitat. We gathered field data from camera-trap studies throughout the Brazilian Amazon to estimate the relative abundance of the species and gain an understanding of its rarity, and how this compares with estimates from other vegetative formations and for sympatric hypercarnivores. We focused on three pristine or partially disturbed sites and one fragmented site. The estimated relative abundance of the species was 0.060-0.185 individuals per 100 trap-days, confirming that the species is rare. The bush dog's abundance in the Amazon is equivalent to that in all other areas outside the Basin. The mean group size recorded was c. 2.5 individuals. There were no differences in group sizes between forests in the Amazon and in other regions of Central America; however, there were significant differences between forests and open habitats. A combination of competition/predation, habitat structure/integrity, and disease may be acting synergistically in determining the abundance and rarity of bush dogs.

TI  - Using amino acids co-occurrence matrices and explainability model to investigate patterns in dengue virus proteins
T2  - BMC BIOINFORMATICS
AB  - Background Dengue is a common vector-borne disease in tropical countries caused by the Dengue virus. This virus may trigger a disease with several symptoms like fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, and muscle pain. Indeed, dengue illness may also present more severe and life-threatening conditions like hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. The causes that lead hosts to develop severe infections are multifactorial and not fully understood. However, it is hypothesized that different viral genome signatures may partially contribute to the disease outcome. Therefore, it is plausible to suggest that deeper DENV genetic information analysis may bring new clues about genetic markers linked to severe illness. Method Pattern recognition in very long protein sequences is a challenge. To overcome this difficulty, we map protein chains onto matrix data structures that reveal patterns and allow us to classify dengue proteins associated with severe illness outcomes in human hosts. Our analysis uses co-occurrence of amino acids to build the matrices and Random Forests to classify them. We then interpret the classification model using SHAP Values to identify which amino acid co-occurrences increase the likelihood of severe outcomes. Results We trained ten binary classifiers, one for each dengue virus protein sequence. We assessed the classifier performance through five metrics: PR-AUC, ROC-AUC, F1-score, Precision and Recall. The highest score on all metrics corresponds to the protein E with a 95% confidence interval. We also compared the means of the classification metrics using the Tukey HSD statistical test. In four of five metrics, protein E was statistically different from proteins M, NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B and NS5, showing that E markers has a greater chance to be associated with severe dengue. Furthermore, the amino acid co-occurrence matrix highlight pairs of amino acids within Domain 1 of E protein that may be associated with the classification result. Conclusion We show the co-occurrence patterns of amino acids present in the protein sequences that most correlate with severe dengue. This evidence, used by the classification model and verified by statistical tests, mainly associates the E protein with the severe outcome of dengue in human hosts. In addition, we present information suggesting that patterns associated with such severe cases can be found mostly in Domain 1, inside protein E. Altogether, our results may aid in developing new treatments and being the target of debate on new theories regarding the infection caused by dengue in human hosts.

TI  - Disease control, demographic change and institutional development in Africa
T2  - JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS
AB  - This paper addresses the role of tropical disease in rural demography and land use rights, using data from Onchocerciasis (river blindness) control in Burkina Faso. We combine a new survey of village elders with historical census data for 1975-2006 and geocoded maps of treatment under the regional Onchocerciasis Control Program (OCP). The OCP ran from 1975 to 2002, first spraying rivers to stop transmission and then distributing medicine to help those already infected. Controlling for time and village fixed effects, we find that villages in treated areas acquired larger populations and also had more cropland transactions, fewer permits required for cropland transactions, and more regulation of common property pasture and forest These effects are robust to numerous controls and tests for heterogeneity across the sample, including time-varying region fixed effects. Descriptive statistics suggest that treated villages also acquired closer access to electricity and telephone service, markets, wells and primary schools, with no difference in several other variables. These results are consistent with both changes in productivity and effects of population size on public institutions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Short Report: Dengue Virus in Bats from Southeastern Mexico
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - To identify the relationship between landscape use and dengue virus (DENV) occurrence in bats, we investigated the presence of DENV from anthropogenically changed and unaltered landscapes in two Biosphere Reserves: Calakmul (Campeche) and Montes Azules (Chiapas) in southern Mexico. Spleen samples of 146 bats, belonging to 16 species, were tested for four DENV serotypes with standard reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) protocols. Six bats (4.1%) tested positive for DENV-2: four bats in Calakmul (two Glossophaga soricina, one Artibeus jamaicensis, and one A. lituratus) and two bats in Montes Azules (both A. lituratus). No effect of anthropogenic disturbance on the occurrence of DENV was detected; however, all three RT-PCR-positive bat species are considered abundant species in the Neotropics and well-adapted to disturbed habitats. To our knowledge, this study is the first study conducted in southeastern Mexico to identify DENV-2 in bats by a widely accepted RT-PCR protocol. The role that bats play on DENV's ecology remains undetermined.

TI  - Worldwide risk factors in leishmaniasis
T2  - ASIAN PACIFIC JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE
AB  - Recently, Vector-borne parasitic diseases such as leishmaniasis have been emerged or re-emerged in many geographical areas and resulted in global health and economic concerns that involve humans, domestic animals and wild life. The ecology and epidemiology of leishmaniasis are affected by the between host, reservoir and vector (human, animal and sandfly) and the environment. Important drivers for the emergence and spread of leishmaniasis include environmental factors such as alterations in temperature and water storage, irrigation habits, deforestation, climate changes, immunosuppression by HIV or organ transplant, development of drug resistance, increase traveling to endemic regions and dog importation. War, poor socio-economic status and low level household are also major contributors to the spread of this disease. Health education via the public media and training should be implemented by international organizations and governmental agencies in collaboration with research institutions. During transmission season, fully protection can be mentioned by using bednets and insecticides and reservoirs' control in the planning. Based on the findings of the recent studies and high prevalence of leishmaniasis, it is concluded that serious public health monitoring should be considered.

TI  - <i>Moringa oleifera</i> Lam and its Therapeutic Effects in Immune Disorders
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - Moringa oleifera Lam., a plant native to tropical forests of India, is characterized by its versatile application as a food additive and supplement therapy. Accumulating evidence shows that Moringa plays a critical role in immune-related diseases. In this review, we cover the history, constituents, edibility, and general medicinal value of Moringa. The effects of Moringa in treating immune disorders are discussed in detail. Moringa can not only eliminate pathogens, including bacteria, fungi, viruses, and parasites, but also inhibit chronic inflammation, such as asthma, ulcerative colitis, and metabolic diseases. Additionally, Moringa can attenuate physical and chemical irritation-induced immune disorders, such as metal intoxication, drug side effects, or even the adverse effect of food additives. Autoimmune diseases, like rheumatoid arthritis, atopic dermatitis, and multiple sclerosis, can also be inhibited by Moringa. Collectively, Moringa, with its multiple immune regulatory bioactivities and few side effects, has a marked potential to treat immune disorders.

TI  - Hybrid Machine Learning Models for Predicting Types of Human T-cell Lymphotropic Virus
T2  - IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY AND BIOINFORMATICS
AB  - Life threatening diseases like adult T-cell leukemia, neurodegenerative diseases, and demyelinating diseases such as HTLV-1 based myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP), hypocalcaemia, and bone lesions are caused by a group of human retrovirus known as Human T-cell Lymphotropic virus (HTLV). Out of the four different types of HTLVs, HTLV-1 is most prominent in scourging over 20 million people around the world and still not much effort has been made in understanding the epidemiology and controlling the prevalence of this virus. This condition further worsens when most of the infected cases remain asymptomatic throughout their lifetime due to the limited diagnostic methods; that are most of the times unavailable for timely detection of infected individuals. Moreover, at present, there is no licensed vaccination for HTLV-1 infection. Therefore, there is a need to develop the faster and efficient diagnostic method for the detection of HTLV-1. Influenced from the outcomes of the machine learning techniques in the field of bio-informatics, this is the first study in which 64 hybrid machine learning techniques have been proposed for the prediction of different type of HTLVs (HTLV-1, HTLV-2, and HTLV-3). The hybrid techniques are built by permutation and combination of four classification methods, four feature weighting, and four feature selection techniques. The proposed hybrid models when evaluated on the basis of various model evaluation parameters are found to be capable of efficiently predicting the type of HTLVs. The best hybrid model has been identified by having accuracy, an AUROC value, and F1 score of 99.85 percent, 0.99, and 0.99, respectively. This kind of the system can assist the current diagnostic system for the detection of HTLV-1 as after the molecular diagnostics of HTLV by various screening tests like enzyme-linked immunoassay or particle agglutination assays there is always a need of confirmatory tests like western blotting, immuno-fluorescence assay, or radio-immuno-precipitation assay for distinguishing HTLV-1 from HTLV-2. These confirmatory tests are indeed very complex analytical techniques involving various steps. The proposed hybrid techniques can be used to support and verify the results of confirmatory test from the protein mixture. Furthermore, better insights about the virus can be obtained by exploring the physicochemical properties of the protein sequences of HTLVs.

TI  - Not all mosquitoes are created equal: A synthesis of vector competence experiments reinforces virus associations of Australian mosquitoes
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - The globalization of mosquito-borne arboviral diseases has placed more than half of the human population at risk. Understanding arbovirus ecology, including the role individual mosquito species play in virus transmission cycles, is critical for limiting disease. Canonical virus-vector groupings, such as Aedes- or Culex-associated flaviviruses, have historically been defined using virus detection in field-collected mosquitoes, mosquito feeding patterns, and vector competence, which quantifies the intrinsic ability of a mosquito to become infected with and transmit a virus during a subsequent blood feed. Herein, we quantitatively synthesize data from 68 laboratory-based vector competence studies of 111 mosquito-virus pairings of Australian mosquito species and viruses of public health concern to further substantiate existing canonical vector-virus groupings and quantify variation within these groupings. Our synthesis reinforces current canonical vector-virus groupings but reveals substantial variation within them. While Aedes species were generally the most competent vectors of canonical "Aedes-associated flaviviruses" (such as dengue, Zika, and yellow fever viruses), there are some notable exceptions; for example, Aedes notoscriptus is an incompetent vector of dengue viruses. Culex spp. were the most competent vectors of many traditionally Culex-associated flaviviruses including West Nile, Japanese encephalitis and Murray Valley encephalitis viruses, although some Aedes spp. are also moderately competent vectors of these viruses. Conversely, many different mosquito genera were associated with the transmission of the arthritogenic alphaviruses, Ross River, Barmah Forest, and chikungunya viruses. We also confirm that vector competence is impacted by multiple barriers to infection and transmission within the mesenteron and salivary glands of the mosquito. Although these barriers represent important bottlenecks, species that were susceptible to infection with a virus were often likely to transmit it. Importantly, this synthesis provides essential information on what species need to be targeted in mosquito control programs.

TI  - MIGRATION AND MALARIA
T2  - SOUTHEAST ASIAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Migration is an important global issue as poorly managed migration can result in a diversity of problems, including an increase in the transmission of diseases such as malaria. There is evidence to suggest that malaria is no longer a forest-dependent disease and may largely be affected by population movements, mostly to agricultural areas. While internal and transnational migration has different legal implications in most countries, both types of migration occur for the same reasons; economic and/or safety. Although migration in itself is not a definitive risk for malaria, several factors can put, migrants and local communities alike, in vulnerable situations. In particular, infrastructure and rural development, deforestation for logging and economic farming, political movements, and natural disasters are some of the major factors that push and pull people in and out of malaria-endemic areas. Therefore, understanding the changing socio-environmental situation as well as population movements and their associated risks for malaria infection, is critical for malaria control, containment, and elimination. Efforts to address these issues should include advocacy, mapping exercises and expanded/strengthened surveillance to also include migrant health information systems. Malaria related information, prevention measures, and early diagnosis and appropriate treatment should be made easily accessible for migrants regardless of their migration status; not only to ensure that they are equipped with appropriate knowledge and devices to protect themselves, but also to ensure that they are properly diagnosed and treated, to prevent further transmission, and to ensure that they are captured by the surveillance system.

TI  - Mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) of temporary ponds of Costa Rica and Nicaragua
T2  - LIMNETICA
AB  - Among aquatic macroinvertebrates, mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) have a worldwide interest for their ability to transmit pathogens that can cause diseases of great medical and veterinary importance. In Central America there is great concern today about mosquito-borne diseases, particularly arboviral diseases such as dengue and, more recently, chikungunya and Zika, but also viral encephalitis such as West Nile fever, and parasitosis of great importance such as malaria. Frequently, some mosquito (Diptera: Culicidae) breeding sites are known and monitored regularly to achieve the corresponding integrated management, especially in urban and peri-urban environments, but not in natural environments, usually less studied. In the context of a study on the limnological characterization of different temporary ponds in the dry tropical forest of Costa Rica and Nicaragua, a total of 7172 mosquito larvae were collected during two sampling periods (2010-2011 and 2017-2018). Sample collection was done by means of a hand net with a mesh of 250 mu m of pore size. In the laboratory, 22 species were identified using a stereomicroscope, microscope, and specific keys, belonging to the genera Aedeomyia, Aedes, Anopheles, Culex, Mansonia, Psorophora and Uranotaenia. Aedes pertinax and Aedes tortilis are reported for the first time for Costa Rica. The possible implications in the transmission of pathogens by these culicids were discussed. This information will allow to update aspects about the diversity of mosquitoes in both countries and provide a useful entomological surveillance tool in the future.

TI  - Chikungunya virus requires cellular chloride channels for efficient genome replication
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Author summary Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne virus that infects humans and causes chikungunya fever-characterized by fever, rash and chronic arthralgia. Treatment of chikungunya fever is limited to the alleviation of the symptoms and no vaccine is available to prevent infection. Consequently, new anti-CHIKV therapies or targets are urgently required. Since its initial isolation in Tanzania in 1952, CHIKV has spread widely across tropical/sub-tropical and more temperate regions. It has been responsible for epidemics in >70 different regions of the world, resulting in high morbidity and financial burden. Despite this, the CHIKV lifecycle is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that CHIKV requires host-cell ion channels that mediate chloride ion (Cl-) flux through the membranes of infected cells, to complete its lifecycle. Specifically, using pharmacological compounds, we show that Cl- channels are required for efficient replication of the virus genome, identify two specific channels (CLIC1 and CLIC4) required for replication and demonstrate that CLIC1 may interact with viral non-structural protein 3 (nsP3)-an essential component of the CHIKV replicase complex. These findings advance our understanding of CHIKV replication and identify potential druggable targets for the treatment and prevention of CHIKV mediated disease.
   Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a re-emerging, pathogenic alphavirus that is transmitted to humans by Aedes spp. mosquitoes-causing fever and debilitating joint pain, with frequent long-term health implications and high morbidity. The CHIKV lifecycle is poorly understood and specific antiviral therapeutics or vaccines are lacking. In this study, we investigated the role of host-cell chloride (Cl-) channels on CHIKV replication.We demonstrate that specific pharmacological Cl- channel inhibitors significantly inhibit CHIKV replication in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that Cl(-)channels are pro-viral factors in human cells. Further analysis of the effect of the inhibitors on CHIKV attachment, entry, viral protein expression and replicon replication demonstrated that Cl- channels are specifically required for efficient CHIKV genome replication. This was conserved in mosquito cells, where CHIKV replication and genome copy number was significantly reduced following Cl- channel inhibition. siRNA silencing identified chloride intracellular channels 1 and 4 (CLIC1 and CLIC4, respectively) as required for efficient CHIKV replication and protein affinity chromatography showed low levels of CLIC1 in complex with CHIKV nsP3, an essential component of the viral replication machinery. In summary, for the first time we demonstrate that efficient replication of the CHIKV genome depends on cellular Cl- channels, in both human and mosquito cells and identifies CLIC1 and CLIC4 as agonists of CHIKV replication in human cells. We observe a modest interaction, either direct or indirect, between CLIC1 and nsP3 and hypothesize that CLIC1 may play a role in the formation/maintenance of CHIKV replication complexes. These findings advance our molecular understanding of CHIKV replication and identify potential druggable targets for the treatment and prevention of CHIKV mediated disease.

TI  - Blood parasites of bird communities in Sri Lanka and their mosquito vectors
T2  - PARASITOLOGY RESEARCH
AB  - Avian blood parasites have been shown to have significant health effects on avifauna worldwide. Sri Lanka, a tropical island rich with resident and migratory birds, has not been properly evaluated for avian blood parasites or their vectors. We investigated the presence of avian haemoparasites in Sri Lankan birds and the potential mosquito vectors of those pathogens. Blood samples were collected from local/migratory birds captured by standard mist nets from Anawilundawa bird sanctuary, Hanthana mountain range, and the University of Peradeniya park. Mosquitoes were collected from Halgolla forest reserve and the forest patches in Kurunegala and Gampola areas in addition to the above mist-netting localities. Part of the mitochondrial cytochrome b (cytb) gene was amplified and sequenced to detect the presence of haemoparasites from avian blood samples (86) and mosquito samples (480). Blood parasites of the two genera, i.e., Haemoproteus (4 species; Haemoproteus sp. 1-4) and Plasmodium (5 species; Plasmodium sp. 1-5) were identified from seven bird species (four resident and three migratory). Among these, three bird species (Red-vented bulbul (3/16), Asian Brown flycatcher (1/1), and India pitta (1/1)) were positive for Plasmodium spp., while four (Yellow-browed bulbul (1/4), oriental white-eye (1/4), brown-headed Barbet (1/4), and Indian blue robin (1/1)) were positive for Haemoproteus spp. Two mosquito species were also positive for Plasmodium (3) and Haemoproteus (1) species. Phylogenetic analysis and haplotype networks created using positive sequences of haemoparasites showed that a Plasmodium clade was shared by Cx nigropunctatus mosquitoes and the migratory bird, Indian pitta. The majority (85%) of the Plasmodium and Haemoproteus sequences of this study were not linked to the well-characterized species suggesting the distinct nature of the lineages. Associations between mosquito species and blood parasites of birds suggest the possible vector status of these mosquitoes.

TI  - LASSA VIRUS ACTIVITY IN GUINEA - DISTRIBUTION OF HUMAN ANTIVIRAL ANTIBODY-DEFINED USING ENZYME-LINKED-IMMUNOSORBENT-ASSAY WITH RECOMBINANT ANTIGEN
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY
AB  - More than 3,100 households in 27 selected villages distributed in the main geographic regions of Guinea were surveyed for the presence of Lassa virus-specific IgG antibodies (LVA), using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with Lassa virus nucleocapsid protein expressed in insect cells infected with a recombinant baculovirus as antigen. The highest prevalence of LVA (25-55%) was found among inhabitants of tropical secondary forest (areas near Gueckedou, Yomou, and Lola) and guinea savannah (Faranah and Kindia areas), near the southern frontiers with Sierra Leone and Liberia. A much lower prevalence (4-7%) was found among inhabitants of mountainous (Pita, Labe, and Mali) and coastal (Boffa, Boke) areas. We found no discernible differences in LVA prevalence between males and females or among various age groups. Testing of 406 hospital staff members of the eight central hospitals in these areas for LVA revealed a similar distribution of seropositivity among hospitals in various prefectures. The highest prevalence of LVA in hospital staff (29-40%) was in the Gueckedou and Lola hospitals. Sera of LVA-positive persons were tested via Western blot analysis. Antibodies bound predominantly to NP and GP2 proteins.

TI  - Rapid assessment of community, environment and health in south Asia
T2  - RESEARCH IN HUMAN ECOLOGY: AN INTERDISCIPLINARY OVERVIEW
CP  - Symposium on the Occasion of the VII International Congress of Ecology (INTECOL)
AB  - The aim of the study was to ascertain what kind of community-based information on primary health care (PHC) and primary environmental care (PEC) is necessary to understand and mitigate global environment and health changes and whether rapid assessment procedures can work as effective monitoring. Reported environmental and health conditions and changes over a 10 year period in a total of 26 village communities in Bangladesh, Nepal and India (State of Madhya Pradesh) were rapidly assessed using a structured questionnaire.
   The results show that the major environmental, health and living problems reported were soil degradation, food shortage, and deforestation. Informants were asked to compare present day conditions with those of a decade ago. Over this period, 53% of villages reported that lice productivity had declined while 38% reported a fall in wheat productivity. On average, villages suffered fi om drought 1.4 times in the last ten years, and all villages in Bangladesh suffered from at least one flood. Households allocated 7.9 hours pet day to firewood collection, a period of time which has increased in 73 percent of the villages. 73 percent of the villages were suffering from seasonal or permanent shortage of drinking water. Some PHC services like immunisation and family planning were very popular. Other services such as health education, food supplement, and tropical disease control were less popular.

TI  - Phylogenetic and ecological factors impact the gut microbiota of two Neotropical primate species
T2  - OECOLOGIA
AB  - Recent studies suggest that variation in diet across time and space results in changes in the mammalian gut microbiota. This variation may ultimately impact host ecology by altering nutritional status and health. Wild animal populations provide an excellent opportunity for understanding these interactions. However, compared to clinical studies, microbial research targeting wild animals is currently limited, and many published studies focus only on a single population of a single host species. In this study we utilize fecal samples from two species of howler monkey (Alouatta pigra and A. palliata) collected at four sites to investigate factors influencing the gut microbiota at three scales: taxonomic (host species), ecosystemic (forest type), and local (habitat disturbance/season). The results demonstrate that the effect of host species on the gut microbiota is stronger than the effect of host forest type, which is stronger than the effect of habitat disturbance or seasonality. Nevertheless, within host species, gut microbiota composition differs in response to forest type, habitat disturbance, and season. Variations in the effect size of these factors are associated both with host species and environment. This information may be beneficial for understanding ecological and evolutionary questions associated with Mesoamerican howler monkeys, as well as determining conservation challenges facing each species. These mechanisms may also provide insight into the ecology of other species of howler monkeys, non-human primates, and mammals.

TI  - Study on Chagas disease occurrence in the municipality of Monte Negro, state of Rondonia, Brazilian Amazon
T2  - REVISTA DA SOCIEDADE BRASILEIRA DE MEDICINA TROPICAL
AB  - Introduction: Studies on Chagas disease deal with the perspective of its occurrence in the Amazon region, which is directly correlated to the population growth and the spread of the bug biotope. The state of Rondonia has an immense source of vectors (Triatomine) and reservoirs of Trypanosoma cruzi. Environmental changes brought forth by the deforestation in the region may cause vector behavior changes and bring these vectors to a closer contact with humans, increasing the probability of vector infection. Methods: This study was carried out to check the occurrence of Chagas disease in the municipality of Monte Negro, Rondonia, Brazil, based on a random sampling of the farms and people wherein blood collection from the population and capturing triatomines were done. The blood samples were submitted to serologic tests to detect antibodies of the IgG class against T. cruzi. The triatomines that were collected had their digestive tract checked for the presence of trypanosomatidae with morphology resembling that of the T. cruzi. Results: The population examined was mostly from other states. From the 322 bugs examined on the microscope, 50% showed parasites with morphology compatible with T. cruzi. From the serology of 344 random samples of human blood, 1.2% was found positive, 6% showed inconclusive results, and 92.8% were negative. Conclusions: Monte Negro shows low prevalence of human infection by T. cruzi and none active vector transmission; however, preventive and surveying measures, which are not performed until now, shall be taken due to the abundance of vectors infected by trypanosomatidae.

TI  - Time for Chocolate: Current Understanding and New Perspectives on Cacao Witches' Broom Disease Research
T2  - PLOS PATHOGENS
AB  - Theobroma cacao is a tropical understory tree that is one of the most important perennial crops in agriculture. Treasured by ancient civilizations in Mesoamerica for over 3,000 years, the cocoa bean now supports a multibillion-dollar industry that is involved in the production and commercialization of chocolate, a treat appreciated worldwide. The cacao tree is originally from the Amazon rainforest and is currently grown in more than 50 countries throughout the humid tropics, serving as a major source of income for over 40 million people. Each year, more than 3 million tons of cocoa beans are produced, mostly by smallholder farmers in areas of high biodiversity. Notably, the cacao tree does not require direct sunlight and naturally grows under the canopy of other, taller trees. This characteristic often encourages farmers to preserve existing forests and to plant additional trees to shelter their cacao plants [1], thereby reducing the environmental impacts of cacao cultivation. Despite its great importance, the cacao tree is affected by a number of untreatable diseases that reduce fruit production and threaten our global supply of cacao. Among them, witches' broom disease (WBD) stands out as one of the most severe problems that affect this crop, accounting for production losses of up to 90%.

TI  - Fatty acid synthase and stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 are conserved druggable cofactors of Old World <i>Alphavirus</i> genome replication
T2  - ANTIVIRAL RESEARCH
AB  - Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a rapidly emerging mosquito-borne RNA virus that causes epidemics of debilitating disease in tropical and sub-tropical regions with autochtonous transmission in regions with temperate climate. Currently, there is no licensed vaccine or specific antiviral drug available against CHIKV infection. In this study, we examine the role, in the CHIKV viral cycle, of fatty acid synthase (FASN) and stearoyl-CoA de-saturase (SCD1), two key lipogenic enzymes required for fatty acid production and early desaturation. We show that both enzymes and their upstream regulator PI3K are required for optimal CHIKV infection. We demonstrate that pharmacologic manipulation of FASN or SCD1 enzymatic activity by non-toxic concentrations of cerulenin or CAY10566 decreases CHIKV genome replication. Interestingly, a similar inhibitory effect was also obtained with Orlistat, an FDA-approved anti-obesity drug that targets FASN activity. These drugs were also effective against Mayaro virus (MAYV), an under-studied arthritogenic Old world Alphavirus endemic in South American countries with potential risk of emergence, urbanization and dispersion to other regions. Altogether, our results identify FASN and SCD1 as conserved druggable cofactors of Alphavirus genome replication and support the broad-spectrum activity of drugs targeting the host fatty acids metabolism.

TI  - Comparative analysis of complete genome sequences of European subtype tick-borne encephalitis virus strains isolated from <i>Ixodes persulcatus</i> ticks, long-tailed ground squirrel (<i>Spermophilus undulatus</i>), and human blood in the Asian part of Russia
T2  - TICKS AND TICK-BORNE DISEASES
AB  - Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is divided into three subtypes: European (TBEV-Eu), Siberian (TBEV-Sib), and Far Eastern (TBEV-FE) subtypes. The geographical range of TBEV-Eu dominates in Europe, but this subtype is present focally across the whole non-tropical forested Eurasian belt, through Russia to South Korea. However, the TBEV-Eu strains isolated outside Europe remain poorly characterized.
   In this study, full-genome sequences of eight TBEV-Eu isolates were determined. These strains were isolated from Ixodes persulcatus ticks, long-tailed ground squirrel (Spermophilus undulatus), and human blood in the natural foci of Western and Eastern Siberia, Russia. A phylogenetic analysis of all available TBEV-Eu genomic sequences revealed that strains from Siberia were closely related to other strains from Europe and South Korea. The closest relation was identified between the Siberian strains and strains from Zmeinogorsk (Western Siberia, Russia) and strain Absettarov (Karelia, Russia), and were most divergent from strains from the Czech Republic and Norway. TBEV-Eu strains isolated in Eastern Siberia were more closely related phylogenetically to strains from South Korea, but strains from Western Siberia grouped together with the strains from Europe, suggesting two genetic TBEV-Eu lineages present in Siberia.

TI  - MALARIA IN MACAQUES
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY
AB  - Seven species of malaria naturally infect eight species of macaques in southwestern India, Sri Lanka, and Southeast Asia. Within malarious areas, the frequency of infections in infected species of macaques varies from 9 to 61%. Natural malarial infections in macaques are relatively benign. The proved or probable vectors of macaque malaria are seven species of mosquitoes that belong to the Leucosphyrus Group of the genus Anopheles. The geographic distribution of macaque malaria apparently is determined by the distribution of the Leucosphyrus Group of mosquitoes, which in turn apparently is determined by the distribution of tropical evergreen rain forest. Experimental infections with three species of macaque malaria frequently are lethal to populations or species of macaques that inhabit areas outside the geographic ranges of the parasites. In populations or species of macaques that are sympatric with experimentally virulent species of malaria, partial resistance probably evolved as a consequence of natural selection acting on favorable mutations.

TI  - Distribution and chromosomal characterization of the anopheles <i>gambiae</i> complex in Angola
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Mosquitoes of the Anopheles gambiae complex (N = 1,336) were sampled (2001-2005) across Angola to identify taxa, study inversion polymorphisms, and detect the circumsporozoite protein of Plasmodium falciparum. Anopheles gambiae s.s. was found in all sites; it was characterized as M-form in localities of the tropical dry and semi-desertic belts, whereas the S-form was predominant in comparatively more humid and less anthropized sites. Both forms were characterized by low degrees of chromosomal polymorphism based solely on the 2La inversion, a pattern usually associated with An. gambiae populations from forested, humid, and derived savanna areas. Unexpectedly, this pattern was also observed in M-form populations collected in dry/pre-desertic areas, where this form largely predominates over An. arabiensis, which was also detected in central/inland sites. Anopheles melas was found in northern coastal sites. Three of 534 An. gambiae s.s. were positive for P. falciparum CS-protein, whereas none of the 1.05 An. melas were positive.

TI  - Day-to-Day Population Movement and the Management of Dengue Epidemics
T2  - BULLETIN OF MATHEMATICAL BIOLOGY
AB  - Dengue is a growing public health problem in tropical and subtropical cities. It is transmitted by mosquitoes, and the main strategy for epidemic prevention and control is insecticide fumigation. Effective management is, however, proving elusive. People's day-to-day movement about the city is believed to be an important factor in the epidemiological dynamics. We use a simple model to examine the fundamental roles of broad demographic and spatial structures in epidemic initiation, growth and control. We show that the key factors are local dilution, characterised by the vector-host ratio, and spatial connectivity, characterised by the extent of habitually variable movement patterns. Epidemic risk in the population is driven by the demographic groups that frequent the areas with the highest vector-host ratio, even if they only spend some of their time there. Synchronisation of epidemic trajectories in different demographic groups is governed by the vector-host ratios to which they are exposed and the strength of connectivity. Strategies for epidemic prevention and management may be made more effective if they take into account the fluctuating landscape of transmission intensity associated with spatial heterogeneity in the vector-host ratio and people's day-to-day movement patterns.

TI  - Diagnostics and monitoring tools for noncommunicable diseases: a missing component in the global response
T2  - GLOBALIZATION AND HEALTH
AB  - A key component of any health system is the capacity to accurately diagnose individuals. One of the six building blocks of a health system as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) includes diagnostic tools. The WHO's Noncommunicable Disease Global Action Plan includes addressing the lack of diagnostics for noncommunicable diseases, through multi-stakeholder collaborations to develop new technologies that are affordable, safe, effective and quality controlled, and improving laboratory and diagnostic capacity and human resources. Many challenges exist beyond price and availability for the current tools included in the Package of Essential Noncommunicable Disease Interventions (PEN) for cardiovascular disease, diabetes and chronic respiratory diseases. These include temperature stability, adaptability to various settings (e.g. at high altitude), need for training in order to perform and interpret the test, the need for maintenance and calibration, and for Blood Glucose Meters non-compatible meters and test strips. To date the issues surrounding access to diagnostic and monitoring tools for noncommunicable diseases have not been addressed in much detail. The aim of this Commentary is to present the current landscape and challenges with regards to guidance from the WHO on diagnostic tools using the WHO REASSURED criteria, which define a set of key characteristics for diagnostic tests and tools. These criteria have been used for communicable diseases, but so far have not been used for noncommunicable diseases. Diagnostic tools have played an important role in addressing many communicable diseases, such as HIV, TB and neglected tropical diseases. Clearly more attention with regards to diagnostics for noncommunicable diseases as a key component of the health system is needed.

TI  - Molecular characterisation of fungal endophytic morphospecies associated with the indigenous forest tree, <i>Theobroma gileri</i>, in Ecuador
T2  - MYCOLOGICAL RESEARCH
AB  - Fungal endophytes were isolated from healthy stems and pods of Theobroma gileri, an alternative host of the frosty pod rot pathogen of cacao. Non-sporulating isolates were grouped into 46 different morphological species according to their colony morphology. Many of these morphospecies were assumed to be basidiomycetes and, therefore, were of particular interest. Basidiomycetous endophytes have received far less attention than ascomycetes and also have potential as biological control agents of the basidiomycetous pathogens of T. cacao: Moniliophthora roreri (frosty pod rot pathogen) and M. perniciosa (witches' broom disease). The morphospecies were further characterised by molecular analyses. Amplification of the nuLSU was undertaken for phylogenetic placement of these non-sporulating cultures and revealed a total of 31 different taxa of which 15 were basidiomycetes belonging to the class Agaricomycetes, and 16 ascomycetes primarily belonging to the Sordariomycetes.

TI  - Vectors of Chikungunya virus in Senegal: Current data and transmission cycles
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Chikungunya fever is a viral disease transmitted to human beings by Aedes genus mosquitoes. From 1972 to 1986 in Kedougou, Senegal, 178 Chikungunya virus strains were isolated from gallery forest mosquitoes, with most of them isolated from Ae. furcifer-taylori (129 strains), Ae. luteocephalus (27 strains), and Ae. dalzieli (12 strains). The characteristics of the sylvatic transmission cycle are a circulation periodicity with silent intervals that last approximately three years. Few epidemics of this disease have been reported in Senegal. The most recent one occurred in 1996 in Kaffrine where two Chikungunya virus strains were isolated from Ae. aegypti. The retrospective analysis of viral isolates from mosquitoes, wild vertebrates, and humans allowed to us to characterize Chikungunya virus transmission cycles in Senegal and to compare them with those of yellow fever virus.

TI  - Quaternion-Based Texture Analysis of Multiband Satellite Images: Application to the Estimation of Aboveground Biomass in the East Region of Cameroon
T2  - ACTA BIOTHEORETICA
AB  - Within the last decade, several approaches using quaternion numbers to handle and model multiband images in a holistic manner were introduced. The quaternion Fourier transform can be efficiently used to model texture in multidimensional data such as color images. For practical application, multispectral satellite data appear as a primary source for measuring past trends and monitoring changes in forest carbon stocks. In this work, we propose a texture-color descriptor based on the quaternion Fourier transform to extract relevant information from multiband satellite images. We propose a new multiband image texture model extraction, called FOTO++, in order to address biomass estimation issues. The first stage consists in removing noise from the multispectral data while preserving the edges of canopies. Afterward, color texture descriptors are extracted thanks to a discrete form of the quaternion Fourier transform, and finally the support vector regression method is used to deduce biomass estimation from texture indices. Our texture features are modeled using a vector composed with the radial spectrum coming from the amplitude of the quaternion Fourier transform. We conduct several experiments in order to study the sensitivity of our model to acquisition parameters. We also assess its performance both on synthetic images and on real multispectral images of Cameroonian forest. The results show that our model is more robust to acquisition parameters than the classical Fourier Texture Ordination model (FOTO). Our scheme is also more accurate for aboveground biomass estimation. We stress that a similar methodology could be implemented using quaternion wavelets. These results highlight the potential of the quaternion-based approach to study multispectral satellite images.

TI  - Kirramyces <i>viscidus</i> sp nov., a new eucalypt pathogen from tropical Australia closely related to the serious leaf pathogen, Kirramyces destructans
T2  - AUSTRALASIAN PLANT PATHOLOGY
AB  - Kirramyces destructans is a serious pathogen causing a leaf, bud and shoot blight disease of Eucalyptus plantations in the subtropics and tropics of South-East Asia. During surveillance of eucalypt taxa trials in northern Queensland, symptoms resembling those of K. destructans were observed on Eucalyptus grandis and E. grandis x E. camaldulensis. Phylogenetic and morphological studies revealed that the Kirramyces sp. associated with these symptoms represents a new taxon described here as K. viscidus sp. nov., which is closely related to K. destructans. Plantation assessments revealed that while E. grandis from the Copperload provenance, collected in northern Queensland, recovered from disease, E. grandis x E. camaldulensis hybrids from South America were highly susceptible to infection by K. viscidus and are not recommended for planting in northern Queensland. Preliminary results suggest the fungus probably originates from Australia. K. viscidus is closely related to K. destructans and causes a disease with similar symptoms, suggesting that it could seriously damage Australian eucalypt plantations, especially those planted off-site.

TI  - Aboveground mangrove biomass estimation in Beibu Gulf using machine learning and UAV remote sensing
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - On the basis of canopy height variables, vegetation index, texture index, and laser point cloud index measured with unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) low altitude remote sensing, we used eight machine learning (ML) models to estimate the aboveground biomass of different species of mangroves in Beibu Gulf and compared the accuracy of different ML models for these estimations. The main species of typical mangrove communities in Kangxiling were Aegiceras corniculata and Sonneratia apetala. The trunks of Sonneratia apetala were thicker, with an average height of 11.82 m, whereas Aegiceras corniculata trees were shorter, with an average height of 2.58 m. The XGBoost regressor (XGBR) model had the highest accuracy in estimating mangrove aboveground biomass (R-2 = 0.8319, RMSE = 22.7638 Mg/ha), followed by the random forest regressor model (R-2 = 0.7887, RMSE = 25.5193 Mg/ha). Support vector regression, decision tree regressor, and extra trees regressor had poor fitting effects. Mangrove texture index ranked first in importance for the model, followed by the mangrove laser point cloud height index, and the laser point cloud intensity index performed the worst in the model. Mangrove aboveground biomass in the study area is high in the north and low in the south, ranging from 38.23 to 171.80 Mg/ha, with an average value of 94.37 Mg/ha. Generally, the XGBR method can better estimate the aboveground biomass of mangroves based on the measured mangrove plot data and UAV low-altitude remote sensing data. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Hepatic lesions associated with induced aflatoxicosis in the estuarine teleost <i>Etroplus suratensis</i> (Bloch, 1790)
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES
AB  - Aflatoxicosis is the disease caused due to ingestion or inhalation of aflatoxins, one of the most potent and dangerous groups of mycotoxins, which is produced by fungi of the genera Aspergillus. This fungus grows on feed as well as on feed ingredients used in aquaculture and the tropical humid climate is conducive for its growth and toxin production. The present study was undertaken to assess the susceptibility of a tropical estuarine teleost, Etroplus suratensis (Bloch, 1790) to this toxin by exposing the fishes to aflatoxin B-1 (AFB(1)) incorporated feed at a rate of 0.4 mg AFB(1)kg(-1) feed, over a period of 8 weeks. On termination of experimental feeding, gross changes such as pale liver with numerous black spots were observed in aflatoxin treated fishes. Progressive damages to the liver which ultimately led to the induction of hepatoma was demonstrated through histopathological and electron microscopic studies. The major histopathological changes such as shrunken pyknotic nuclei, formation of basophilic foci, polyhedral hepatocytes in different sizes, multiple nuclei and mitotic nuclei were observed. The ultrastructural changes such as appearance of electron dense inclusions in the nucleus, loss of structure of microvilli, fragmentation of endoplasmic reticulum, separation of desmosomes, loss of continuity of plasma-lemma and nuclear membranes were also evident. In the present study, susceptibility of the species to aflatoxicosis was demonstrated clearly and the resultant induction of hepatoma indicated the possibility of using this species as an animal model in studies on induction of hepatocarcinomas.

TI  - Prevalence of Malaria and Leptospirosis Co-Infection among Febrile Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE
AB  - Malaria and leptospirosis are important cosmopolitan infections that have emerged with overlapping geographic distribution, especially in tropical and subtropical regions. Therefore, co-infection with malaria and leptospirosis may occur in overlapping areas. The present study aimed to quantify the prevalence of malaria and leptospirosis co-infection among febrile patients. The association between malaria and leptospirosis infections was also investigated. Relevant studies that had reported malaria and leptospirosis co-infection were identified from PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. The risk of bias of the studies was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Tool. The pooled prevalence of malaria and leptospirosis co-infections among febrile patients and the pooled prevalence of leptospirosis infection among malaria patients were estimated using random effect models. The association between malaria and leptospirosis infection among febrile patients was estimated using random effect models. The outcomes of each study were shown in a forest plot in point estimate and 95% confidence interval (CI). Heterogeneity among the included studies was assessed using Cochran's Q and quantified using I-squared statistics. For leptospirosis, subgroup analyses of countries, diagnostic tests, and participants' age groups were performed to specify prevalence in each subgroup. Publication bias was assessed by funnel-plot visualization. Of the 2370 articles identified from the databases, 15 studies met the eligibility criteria and were included for qualitative and quantitative syntheses. Most of the included studies were conducted in India (5/15, 33.3%), Thailand (3/15, 20%), and Cambodia (2/15, 13.3%). Most of the enrolled cases were febrile patients (5838 cases) and malaria-positive patients (421 cases). The meta-analysis showed that the pooled prevalence of malaria and leptospirosis co-infection (86 cases) among febrile patients was 1% (95% CI: 1-2%, I-2: 83.3%), while the pooled prevalence of leptospirosis infection (186 cases) among malaria patients was 13% (95% CI: 9-18%, I-2: 90.3%). The meta-analysis showed that malaria and leptospirosis co-infections occurred by chance (p: 0.434, OR: 1.4, 95% CI: 0.6-3.28, I-2: 85.2%). The prevalence of malaria in leptospirosis co-infection among febrile patients in the included studies was low. Co-infection was likely to occur by chance. However, as clinical symptoms of leptospirosis patients were non-specific and not distinguishable from symptoms of malaria patients, clinicians caring for febrile patients in an area where those two diseases are endemic should maintain a high index of suspicion for both diseases and whether mono-infections or co-infections are likely. Recognition of this co-infection may play an important role in reducing disease severity and treatment duration.

TI  - SEASONAL INCIDENCE AND HEMOPARASITE INFECTION-RATES OF IXODID TICKS (ACARI, IXODIDAE) DETACHED FROM CATTLE IN COSTA-RICA
T2  - REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL
AB  - To determine the tick species hindering the cattle industry in Costa Rica and to assess infection rates of ticks with three important hemoparasite species, cattle were monitored during a period of six months (October 1992 - March 1993). Four farms were located in the dry pacific region of the canton of Tilaran and a fifth farm on the slopes of the Poas volcano in a cool tropical cloud-forest ecosystem. On each farm 3 to 5 animals of 6 to 24 months of age were selected at random. All ticks were removed on a monthly basis from the right half side of each animal, while the site of attachment was recorded. Ticks were counted and differentiated according to species, developmental stage and sex. Moreover, engorged female ticks were assayed for the presence of Babesia bigemina, Babesia bovis and Anaplasma marginale using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) multiplex system. Two species of ticks, Amblyomma cajennense and Boophilus microplus, were encountered on the cattle in the Tilaran region and one species, B. microplus, was detected in the Poas region. Two to ten times as many ticks were encountered in the Tilaran region than in the Poas region, which is in accordance with a stable enzootic protozoan disease situation in the former region and an unstable epizootic situation in the latter region. Nymphal and adult stages of both tick species were present in largest numbers on the ventral parts of the animals. PCR analysis of entire ticks indicated very high infection rates with hemoparasites of veterinary importance. This was in accordance with high seroprevalence rates in the hosts.

TI  - Analysis of a Reverse Transcription Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP) for yellow fever diagnostic
T2  - JOURNAL OF VIROLOGICAL METHODS
AB  - Yellow Fever virus (YFV) is an important human pathogen in tropical areas of Africa and South America. Although an efficient vaccine is available and has been used since the early 1940s, sylvatic YFV transmission still occurs in forested areas where anthropogenic actions are present, such as mineral extraction, rearing livestock and agriculture, and ecological tourism. In this context, two distinct techniques based on the RT-PCR derived method have been previously developed, however both methods are expensive due to the use of thermo cyclers and labeled probes. We developed isothermal genome amplification, which is a rapid, sensitive, specific and low cost molecular approach for YFV genome detection. This assay used a set of degenerate primers designed for the NS1 gene and was able to amplify, within 30 mm in isothermal conditions, the YFV 17D vaccine strain derived from an African wild prototype strain (Asibi), as well as field strains from Brazil, other endemic countries from South and Central America, and the Caribbean. The generic RT-LAMP assay could be helpful for YFV surveillance in field and rapid response during outbreaks in endemic areas. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Atlas of Mexican Triatominae (Reduviidae: Hemiptera) and vector transmission of Chagas disease
T2  - MEMORIAS DO INSTITUTO OSWALDO CRUZ
CP  - 13th International Congress of Parasitology
AB  - Chagas disease is one of the most important yet neglected parasitic diseases in Mexico and is transmitted by Triatominae. Nineteen of the 31 Mexican triatomine species have been consistently found to invade human houses and all have been found to be naturally infected with Trypanosoma cruzi. The present paper aims to produce a state-of-knowledge atlas of Mexican triatomines and analyse their geographic associations with T. cruzi, human demographics and landscape modification. Ecological niche models (ENMs) were constructed for the 19 species with more than 10 records in North America, as well as for T. cruzi. The 2010 Mexican national census and the 2007 National Forestry Inventory were used to analyse overlap patterns with ENMs. Niche breadth was greatest in species from the semiarid Nearctic Region, whereas species richness was associated with topographic heterogeneity in the Neotropical Region, particularly along the Pacific Coast. Three species, Triatoma longipennis, Triatoma mexicana and Triatoma barberi, overlapped with the greatest numbers of human communities, but these communities had the lowest rural/urban population ratios. Triatomine vectors have urbanised in most regions, demonstrating a high tolerance to human-modified habitats and broadened historical ranges, exposing more than 88% of the Mexican population and leaving few areas in Mexico without the potential for T. cruzi transmission.

TI  - Pattern of climate connectivity and equivalent niche of Triatominae species of the<i>Phyllosoma</i>complex
T2  - MEDICAL AND VETERINARY ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - ThePhyllosomacomplex is a Triatominae (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) group of medical importance involved inTrypanosoma cruzi(Kinetoplastida: Trypanosomatidae) transmission. Most of the members of this group are endemic and sympatric species with distribution in Mexico and the southern U.S.A. We employed MaxEnt to construct ecological niche models of nine species of Triatominae to test three hypothesis: (a) whether species with a broad climatic niche breadth occupy a broader geographical range than species with a narrow climatic breadth, (b) whether species with broad distribution present high degree of climatic fragmentation/isolation, which was tested through landscape metrics; and (c) whether the species share the same climatic niche space (niche conservatism) considered through an equivalence test implemented in ENMtools. Overall, our results suggest that the geographical distribution of this complex is influenced mainly by temperature seasonality where all suitable areas are places of current and potential transmission ofT. cruzi. Niche breadth in thePhyllosomacomplex is associated with the geographical distribution range, and the geographical range affects the climatic connectivity. We found no strong evidence of niche climatic divergence in members of this complex. We discuss the epidemiological implications of these results.

TI  - Entomopathogenic fungi and their potential for the management of <i>Aedes</i> <i>aegypti</i> (Diptera: Culicidae) in the Americas
T2  - MEMORIAS DO INSTITUTO OSWALDO CRUZ
AB  - Classical biological control has been used extensively for the management of exotic weeds and agricultural pests, but never for alien insect vectors of medical importance. This simple but elegant control strategy involves the introduction of coevolved natural enemies from the centre of origin of the target alien species. Aedes aegypti - the primary vector of the dengue, yellow fever and Zika flaviviruses - is just such an invasive alien in the Americas where it arrived accidentally from its West African home during the slave trade. Here, we introduce the concept of exploiting entomopathogenic fungi from Africa for the classical biological control of Ae. aegypti in the Americas. Fungal pathogens attacking arthropods are ubiquitous in tropical forests and are important components in the natural balance of arthropod populations. They can produce a range of specialised spore forms, as well as inducing a variety of bizarre behaviours in their hosts, in order to maximise infection. The fungal groups recorded as specialised pathogens of mosquito hosts worldwide are described and discussed. We opine that similar fungal pathogens will be found attacking and manipulating Ae. aegypti in African forests and that these could be employed for an economic, environmentally-safe and long-term solution to the flavivirus pandemics in the Americas.

TI  - Plants and animals utilized as medicines in the Jau National Park (JNP), Brazilian Amazon
T2  - PHYTOTHERAPY RESEARCH
AB  - This article examines the therapeutic practices of the inhabitants of Jau National Park (JNP), state of Amazonas, the most important feature of this region being its rich biodiversity associated with isolation in regard to conventional medical services. Seven months of field work were guided by methods of anthropology and botany. A total of 120 plants and 29 animals were utilized in 519 recorded uses comprising 81 therapeutic purposes. These were grouped under 15 categories of use, including: gastrointestinal disturbances, inflammatory processes, genitourinary disturbances, fever, mishaps with animals, dermatological problems, pain, osteo-muscular problems and tropical diseases. Those who administer these medicines are local residents specializing in household remedies and other groups of healers such as rezadores-prayer-maker; curadores-healers; parteiras-midwives; desmintidores-masseurs and mediuns-mediums. At least 10 of the 120 plants species cited in this study are also utilized by other inhabitants of the Amazon region and for the same uses; some of these plants had already been studied from a pharmacological point of view. Furthermore, another six plants cited by the JNP caboclos belonging to the categories pain and inflammatory processes, are under investigation by groups of researchers in two Brazilian federal universities.

TI  - Patterns of dispersal syndromes of plants in areas with different total rainfall, Pernambuco state, Brazil
T2  - ACTA BOTANICA BRASILICA
AB  - (Patterns of dispersal syndromes of plants in areas with different total rainfall, Pernambuco state, Brazil). This study aimed to describe the proportion of dispersal syndromes in three remnants of native vegetation with distinct total rainfall and number of dry months. During three years of monthly sampling we collected and described fruits and diaspores of 107 species. The areas with precipitation less than 700 mm/year (Floresta and Caruaru) showed similar proportions of dispersal syndromes (autochory, anemochory and zoochory), whereas Tapacura (mean annual precipitation 1300 mm) was distinguished mainly by zoochory, which varied from 29% (Floresta) to 51% (Tapacura) of the species. The distribution of dispersal syndromes along a vertical gradient showed a higher proportion of zoochory in the understory of more humid areas such as Tapacura, while in drier areas (Floresta and Caruaru) autochory and anemochory were more representative in the canopy. These results indicate that the abiotic vectors become more important with the decrease in rainfall, and also that dispersal-syndrome proportions differ with stratification.

TI  - Machine learning-based integration of remotely-sensed drought factors can improve the estimation of agricultural drought in South-Eastern Australia
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB  - Agricultural drought is a natural hazard arising from insufficient crop water supply. Many drought indices have been developed to characterize agricultural drought, relying on either ground-based climate data or various remotely-sensed drought proxies. Ground-based drought indices are more accurate but limited in coverage, while remote sensing drought indices cover large areas but have poor precision. Application of advanced data fusion approaches based on remotely-sensed data to estimate ground-based drought indices may help fill this gap. The overall objective of this study was to determine whether various remotely-sensed drought factors could be effectively used for monitoring agricultural drought in south-eastern Australia. In this study, thirty remotely-sensed drought factors from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite sensors were used to reproduce a ground-based drought index, SPEI (Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index) during 2001-2017 for the New South Wales wheat belt in south-eastern Australia. Three advanced machine learning methods, i.e. bias-corrected random forest, support vector machine, and multi-layer perceptron neural network, were adopted as the regression models in this procedure. A station-based historical climate dataset and observed wheat yields were used as reference data to evaluate the performance of the model-predicted SPEI in reflecting agricultural drought. Results show that the bias-corrected random forest model outperformed the other two models for SPEI prediction, as quantified by the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) and the highest R-2 values (< 0.28 and similar to 0.9, respectively). Drought distribution maps produced by the bias-corrected random forest model were then compared with the station-based drought maps, showing strong visual and statistical agreement. Furthermore, the model-predicted SPEI values were more highly correlated with observed wheat yields than the station-based SPEI. The method used in this study is effective and fast, and based on data that are readily available. It can be easily extended to other cropping areas to produce a rapid overview of drought conditions and to enhance the present capabilities of real-time drought monitoring.

TI  - Characterization of Feeding Behavior and its Relationship With the Longevity of Wild and Peridomestic Triatoma dimidiata, Latreille 1811 (Hemiptera, Reduviidae) Under Laboratory Conditions
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - Triatoma dimidiata (Latreille 1811) is considered the second most important vector of the Trypanosa cruzi etiological agent of Chagas disease in Colombia. It has a life cycle that involves a domiciled, peridomiciled, and wild distribution. The study of feeding behavior and its influence on the survival of sylvatic and peridomestic populations can help identify a possible differential risk in the transmission of Chagas disease to humans, mainly in northwestern and east-central Colombia. We characterize the main parameters of feeding behavior and their influence on the longevity and survival of two rat-fed populations of T. dimidiata from Colombia, one in the north-west (from palms in a tropical dry forest area) and the other in the center-east (peridomiciliated), under controlled environmental conditions. The palm population took considerably longer than the peridomestic population to complete its life cycle under experimental laboratory conditions, being both populations univoltine since they have only one life cycle per year. Statistically significant differences were evidenced using Box-Cox model between the survival rates of T. dimidiata populations when the parameters related to blood intake and behavior were incorporated, in contrast to the survival models in which the origin only was considered as a factor. Our results could be used to generate recommendations to guide prevention strategies in communities near sylvatic and peridomiciliated populations of T. dimidiata.

AB  - Background: As malaria transmission declines, it becomes more geographically focused and more likely due to asymptomatic and non-falciparum infections. To inform malaria elimination planning in the context of this changing epidemiology, local assessments on the risk factors for malaria infection are necessary, yet challenging due to the low number of malaria cases.
   Methods: A population-based, cross-sectional study was performed using passive and active surveillance data collected in Aceh Besar District, Indonesia from 2014 to 2015. Malaria infection was defined as symptomatic polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed infection in index cases reported from health facilities, and asymptomatic or symptomatic PCR-confirmed infection identified in reactive case detection (RACD). Potential risk factors for any infection, species-specific infection, or secondary-case detection in RACD were assessed through questionnaires and evaluated for associations.
   Results: Nineteen Plasmodium knowlesi, 12 Plasmodium vivax and six Plasmodium falciparum cases were identified passively, and 1495 community members screened in RACD, of which six secondary cases were detected (one P. knowlesi, three P. vivax, and two P. falciparum, with four being asymptomatic). Compared to non-infected subjects screened in RACD, cases identified through passive or active surveillance were more likely to be male (AOR 12.5, 95 % CI 3.0-52.1), adult (AOR 14.0, 95 % CI 2.2-89.6 for age 16-45 years compared to <15 years), have visited the forest in the previous month for any reason (AOR 5.6, 95 % CI 1.3-24.2), and have a workplace near or in the forest and requiring overnight stays (AOR 7.9, 95 % CI 1.6-39.7 compared to workplace not near or in the forest). Comparing subjects with infections of different species, differences were observed in sub-district of residence and other demographic and behavioural factors. Among subjects screened in RACD, cases compared to non-cases were more likely to be febrile and reside within 100 m of the index case.
   Conclusion: In this setting, risk of malaria infection in index and RACD identified cases was associated with forest exposure, particularly overnights in the forest for work. In low-transmission settings, utilization of data available through routine passive and active surveillance can support efforts to target individuals at high risk.

TI  - Towards Chagas disease elimination: Neonatal screening for congenital transmission in rural communities
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Chagas disease is a neglected tropical disease that continues to affect populations living in extreme poverty in Latin America. After successful vector control programs, congenital transmission remains as a challenge to disease elimination. We used the PRECEDE-PROCEED planning model to develop strategies for neonatal screening of congenital Chagas disease in rural communities of Guatemala. These communities have persistent high triatomine infestations and low access to healthcare. We used mixed methods with multiple stakeholders to identify and address maternal-infant health behaviors through semi-structured interviews, participatory group meetings, archival reviews and a cross-sectional survey in high risk communities. From December 2015 to April 2016, we jointly developed a strategy to illustratively advertise newborn screening at the Health Center. The strategy included socioculturally appropriate promotional and educational material, in collaboration with midwives, nurses and nongovernmental organizations. By March 2016, eight of 228 (3.9%) pregnant women had been diagnosed with T. cruzi at the Health Center. Up to this date, no neonatal screening had been performed. By August 2016, seven of eight newborns born to Chagas seropositive women had been parasitologically screened at the Health Center, according to international standards. Thus, we implemented a successful community-based neonatal screening strategy to promote congenital Chagas disease healthcare in a rural setting. The success of the health promotion strategies developed will depend on local access to maternal-infant services, integration with detection of other congenital diseases and reliance on community participation in problem and solution definition.

TI  - EFFECTS OF NARROWING GENETIC BASE AND ABIOTIC STRESS ON LEAF SPOTTING IN <i>GREVILLEA ROBUSTA</i>
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL FOREST SCIENCE
AB  - KIMATU JN. 2011. Effects of narrowing genetic base and abiotic stress on leaf spotting in Grevillea robusta. Grevillea robusta is a widely grown agroforestry tree and is regarded as a pioneering coloniser of disturbed sites. Our current understanding on changes of species due to disturbance, abiotic conditions and biotic interactions is very minimal. We investigated a leaf-spotting disease and abnormal growths on G. robusta in Yala and Kodera forest plots in Nyanza province, Kenya. The study comprised symptomology, identification of causal pathogens as well as tissue and soil analyses. Phyllosticta spp. and Pestalotia spp. fungi were isolated from the leaf spots. Seedling reinoculation confirmed Phyllosticta spp. as the lesser opportunistic cause of the leaf spot. However, mineral and proteoid root analyses suggested that abiotic and genetic factors were the main causes of the leaf spotting. The Yala forest had lower pH, phosphorus toxicity (> 0.07%) and poor water drainage, while the Kodera forest had generally high manganese toxicities in soil and leaf tissue.

TI  - HEMORRHAGIC-FEVER VIRUS ACTIVITY IN EQUATORIAL AFRICA - DISTRIBUTION AND PREVALENCE OF FILOVIRUS REACTIVE ANTIBODY IN THE CENTRAL-AFRICAN-REPUBLIC
T2  - TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Seroepidemiological surveys were conducted to determine the frequency and distribution of haemorrhagic fever virus (HFV) activity in the Central African Republic. Human serum specimens (4295) were collected from 5 ecologically distinct zones. Serological evidence of HFV activity was found in all the zones. The filovirus antibody prevalence (24.4%, 1051/4295) was greater than the combined prevalence for Lassa virus, Rift Valley fever virus and Crimean-Congo HFV antibody (1.1%, 45/4295; P<0.01). Evidence of filovirus activity was found in all zones: 21.3% (914/4295) of the population were seropositive for Ebola virus antibody while only 3.2% (137/4295) were seroreactive with Marburg viral antigens. Age and sex were important host-related factors influencing filovirus activity, particularly in dry grassland and moist forest communities. These communities shared many factors, but differences, such as agricultural practices and ethnic backgrounds, may also affect the risk of infection. Filovirus infections appear to occur without apparent disease. Continued investigations are needed to evaluate the true pathogenicity of the African filoviruses and the likelihood that unidentified serologically cross-reacting and non-pathogenic members of the filovirus family are active in equatorial Africa.

TI  - Concurrence of dermatological and ophthalmological morbidity in onchocerciasis
T2  - TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Prevalence of skin and eye disorders in African onchocerciasis (river blindness) is well documented. However, less is known about their joint occurrence. Information on concurrence may improve our understanding of disease pathogenesis and is required to estimate the disease burden of onchocerciasis. We analysed data from 765 individuals from forest villages in the Kumba and Ngambe Health districts, Cameroon. These data were collected in 1998, as baseline data for the evaluation of the African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control. Concurrence of symptoms was assessed using logistic regression. Onchocerciasis was highly endemic in the study population (63% nodule prevalence among males aged >= 20). Considerable overall prevalences of onchocercal visual impairment (low vision or blindness: 4%), troublesome itch (15%), reactive skin disease (19%), and skin depigmentation (25%) were observed. The association between onchocercal visual impairment and skin depigmentation (OR 9.0, 95% CI 3.9-20.8) was partly explained by age and exposure to infection (OR 3.0, 95% CI 1.2-7.7). The association between troublesome itch and reactive skin disease was hardly affected by adjustment (adjusted OR 6.9, 95% CI 4.2-11.1). Concluding, there is significant concurrence of morbidities within onchocerciasis. Our results suggest a possible role of host characteristics in the pathogenesis of depigmentation and visual impairment. Further, we propose a method to deal with concurrence when estimating the burden of disease. (C) 2011 Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Aquatic life in Neotropical rainforest canopies: Techniques using artificial phytotelmata to study the invertebrate communities inhabiting therein
T2  - COMPTES RENDUS BIOLOGIES
AB  - In Neotropical rainforest canopies, phytotelmata ("plant-held waters'') shelter diverse aquatic macroinvertebrate communities, including vectors of animal diseases. Studying these communities is difficult because phytotelmata are widely dispersed, hard to find from the ground and often inaccessible. We propose here a method for placing in tree crowns "artificial phytotelmata'' whose size and shape can be tailored to different research targets. The efficacy of this method was shown while comparing the patterns of community diversity of three forest formations. We noted a difference between a riparian forest and a rainforest, whereas trees alongside a dirt road cutting through that rainforest corresponded to a subset of the latter. Because rarefied species richness was significantly lower when the phytotelmata were left for three weeks rather than for six or nine weeks, we recommend leaving the phytotelmata for twelve weeks to permit predators and phoretic species to fully establish themselves.

TI  - Trends in total rainfall, heavy rain events, and number of dry days in San Juan, Puerto Rico, 1955-2009
T2  - ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
AB  - Climate variability is a threat to water resources on a global scale and in tropical regions in particular. Rainfall events and patterns are associated worldwide with natural disasters like mudslides and landslides, meteorological phenomena like hurricanes, risks/hazards including severe storms and flooding, and health effects like vector-borne and waterborne diseases. Therefore, in the context of global change, research on rainfall patterns and their variations presents a challenge to the scientific community. The main objective of this research was to analyze recent trends in precipitation in the San Juan metropolitan area in Puerto Rico and their relationship with regional and global climate variations. The statistical trend analysis of precipitation was performed with the nonparametric Mann-Kendall test. All stations showed positive trends of increasing annual rainfall between 1955 and 2009. The winter months of January and February had an increase in monthly rainfall, although winter is normally a dry season on the island. Regarding dry days, we found an annual decreasing trend, also specifically in winter. In terms of numbers of severe rainfall events described as more than 78 mm in 24 hours, 63 episodes have occurred in the San Juan area in the last decade, specifically in the 2000-2009 time frame, with an average of 6 severe events per year. The majority of the episodes occurred in summer, more frequently in August and September. These results can be seen as a clear example of the complexity of spatial and temporal of rainfall distribution over a tropical city.

TI  - High-accuracy detection of malaria vector larval habitats using drone-based multispectral imagery
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Interest in larval source management (LSM) as an adjunct intervention to control and eliminate malaria transmission has recently increased mainly because long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) and indoor residual spray (IRS) are ineffective against exophagic and exophilic mosquitoes. In Amazonian Peru, the identification of the most productive, positive water bodies would increase the impact of targeted mosquito control on aquatic life stages. The present study explores the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) for identifying Nyssorhynchus darlingi (formerly Anopheles darlingi) breeding sites with high-resolution imagery ( 0.02m/pixel) and their multispectral profile in Amazonian Peru. Our results show that high-resolution multispectral imagery can discriminate a profile of water bodies where Ny. darlingi is most likely to breed (overall accuracy 86.73%- 96.98%) with a moderate differentiation of spectral bands. This work provides proof-of-concept of the use of high-resolution images to detect malaria vector breeding sites in Amazonian Peru and such innovative methodology could be crucial for LSM malaria integrated interventions.
   Author summary The most efficient malaria vector in the Latin American region is Nyssorhynchus darlingi (formerly Anopheles darlingi). In Amazonian Peru, where malaria is endemic, Ny. darlingi feeds both indoors and outdoors (endophagy, exophagy), depending on the local environment, and rests outdoors (exophily). LLINs and IRS, the most common tools employed for vector control, target endophagic and endophilic mosquitoes. Thus, they are only partially effective against Ny. darlingi. Control of the aquatic stages of vector mosquitoes, larval source management (LSM), targets the most productive breeding sites nearest to human habitation. In four riverine communities, we used drones with high-resolution imagery as a key initial step to analyze water bodies within the estimated flight range of Ny. darlingi, 1 km. We found distinctive spectral profiles for water bodies that were positive versus negative for Ny. darlingi. The methodology and analysis reported here provide the basis for testing whether LSM can be combined successfully with LLINs and IRS to contribute to the elimination of transmission in malaria hotspots in the Amazon.

TI  - Genetic diversity and population structure of <i>Chrysoporthe deuterocubensis</i> isolates from <i>Melastoma</i> and <i>eucalyptus</i> in Malaysia and Indonesia
T2  - FOREST PATHOLOGY
AB  - Chrysoporthe deuterocubensis is the causal agent of a serious canker disease of Eucalyptus spp. in tropical and sub-tropical areas of Asia. Where the disease occurs, Eucalyptus spp. are non-native and the native hosts of the pathogen have not been conclusively determined. The chance discovery of C. deuterocubensis on native Melastoma malabathricum growing in the understory of Eucalyptus trees in Indonesia raised the possibility that this woody shrub could be a native host of C. deuterocubensis, which would then have undergone a host jump to Eucalyptus. Four populations of C. deuterocubensis were collected from cankers on Eucalyptus and Melastoma trees in Indonesia and Malaysia. These were subjected to population genetic analyses using microsatellite markers. The genetic diversity for isolates in all four populations was relatively low (H over bar $$ \overline{H} $$ = 0.166-0.316) and unlikely to represent a native source. The maximum percentage of genotypic diversity was high for all four populations (G(max) = 60.0-71.5%) irrespective of the host. Structure analyses and haplotype networks showed no structure related to the host plant species. Overall, the results failed to provide evidence that the indigenous M. malabathricum is the native host or origin of C. deuterocubensis infections on the Eucalyptus trees studied.

TI  - Patterns of Dothistroma septosporum conidial dispersal in Colombian Pinus tecunumanii plantations
T2  - FOREST PATHOLOGY
AB  - Dothistroma needle blight (DNB) caused by Dothistroma septosporum is one of the most important needle diseases of Pinus spp., especially in Southern Hemisphere plantations. In Colombia, the pathogen has caused severe outbreaks in plantations of Pinus tecunumanii of the low elevation population (LE). Currently, management strategies suffer from a lack of knowledge regarding the epidemiology of D. septosporum under tropical climatic conditions. In this study we determined the patterns of conidial dispersal and considered how climatic conditions in Colombia influence them. The study was conducted over 15 consecutive months between October 2010 and December 2011 using glass slide-based spore traps. Conidia were found on the traps throughout the year, with the peak abundance during November to January (2010) and November to December (2011). During peak conidial production, relative humidity and temperature had the greatest influence on conidial dispersal. Favourable weather conditions in Colombia, particularly rainfall, have contributed to continuous conidial production throughout the year, leading to D. septosporum infections all year round. This high reproductive rate as a consequence of high precipitation is in contrast to other Southern Hemisphere and Northern Hemisphere countries with more specific periods of rainfall and infection.

TI  - Antiviral activity of nobiletin against chikungunya virus <i>in vitro</i>
T2  - ANTIVIRAL THERAPY
AB  - Background: Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), a highly contagious re-emerging virus, is transmitted by infected mosquitoes. CHIKV is prevalent in tropical countries and is continuing to creep farther north into temperate areas. CHIKV is responsible for induction of chikungunya fever (CF) and severe joint stiffness with the capability of developing into bilateral and systemic arthralgia or even encephalitis. Despite the high morbidity rate, no approved antiviral drug is available. Therefore, an anti-CHIKV therapy is necessary to control this disease. In this study, we screened four flavonoids for anti-CHIKV activities: nobiletin, phlorizin, resveratrol and oxyresveratrol.
   Methods: We performed MTT, Viral ToxGlo (TM) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assays to assess the viability of CHIKV-infected host cells. Plaque assay and immunofluorescent assay were utilized to evaluate the levels of viral production in quantification and qualification, respectively.
   Results: We first confirmed that nobiletin can maintain the cellular survival of infected cells without inducing significant toxicity to host cells. Nobiletin suppressed virus-induced cell death and viral production. Also, the antiviral efficacy of nobiletin can last for at least 48 h during infection. More importantly, nobiletin inhibited CHIKV infection during the translation/replication stages and viral entry, making nobiletin a potential clinical antiviral agent in prophylaxis and post-exposure treatment.
   Conclusions: In this study, our results provided a strategy to develop anti-chikungunya agents by utilizing natural compounds. Also, we believe that nobiletin can be a potential antiviral agent against CHIKV infection worthy of being further investigated as a remedial candidate in vivo.

TI  - Improvement of Mangrove Soil Carbon Stocks Estimation in North Vietnam Using Sentinel-2 Data and Machine Learning Approach
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Quantifying total carbon (TC) stocks in soil across various mangrove ecosystems is key to understanding the global carbon cycle to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Estimating mangrove TC at a large scale remains challenging due to the difficulty and high cost of soil carbon measurements when the number of samples is high. In the present study, we investigated the capability of Sentinel-2 multispectral data together with a state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) technique, which is a combination of CatBoost regression (CBR) and a genetic algorithm (GA) for feature selection and optimization (the CBR-GA model) to estimate the mangrove soil C stocks across the mangrove ecosystems in North Vietnam. We used the field survey data collected from 177 soil cores. We compared the performance of the proposed model with those of the four ML algorithms, i.e., the extreme gradient boosting regression (XGBR), the light gradient boosting machine regression (LGBMR), the support vector regression (SVR), and the random forest regression (RFR) models. Our proposed model estimated the TC level in the soil as 35.06-166.83 Mg ha(-1) (average = 92.27 Mg ha(-1)) with satisfactory accuracy (R (2) = 0.665, RMSE = 18.41 Mg ha(-1)) and yielded the best prediction performance among all the ML techniques. We conclude that the Sentinel-2 data combined with the CBR-GA model can improve estimates of the mangrove TC at 10 m spatial resolution in tropical areas. The effectiveness of the proposed approach should be further evaluated for different mangrove soils of the other mangrove ecosystems in tropical and semi-tropical regions.

TI  - Mechanism of the Toxicity Induced by Natural Humic Acid on Human Vascular Endothelial Cells
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY
AB  - Humic acid (HA), a group of high-molecular weight organic compounds characterized by an ability to bind heavy metals, is normally found in natural water. Although the impairment of vascular endothelial cells in the presence of humic substances has been reported to be involved in some diseases, the mechanisms responsible for this involvement remain unclear. In this study, we examined the cytotoxicity of HA obtained from peatland in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, to human vascular endothelial cells, as well as the mechanisms behind these effects. It was found that 50 mg/L HA showed cytotoxicity, which we considered to be mediated by apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway because of an increase in the expression of caspases 6 and 9 in response to HA administration. In addition, this cytotoxicity was enhanced when cells in this experimental system were exposed to oxidative stress, while it was decreased by the addition of vitamin C. Thus, we conclude that the apoptosis induced by HA depends upon oxidative stress. Furthermore, an iron chelator, DFO, showed a tendency to decrease HA-induced cytotoxicity, suggesting that iron may potentially mediate HA-induced oxidative stress. In conclusion, long-term consumption of HA-rich water obtained from our study area may cause damage to endothelial cells and subsequent chronic health problems. (C) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - Phylogenetic structure and host abundance drive disease pressure in communities
T2  - NATURE
AB  - Pathogens play an important part in shaping the structure and dynamics of natural communities, because species are not affected by them equally(1,2). A shared goal of ecology and epidemiology is to predict when a species is most vulnerable to disease. A leading hypothesis asserts that the impact of disease should increase with host abundance, producing a 'rare-species advantage'(3-5). However, the impact of a pathogen may be decoupled from host abundance, because most pathogens infect more than one species, leading to pathogen spillover onto closely related species(6,7). Here we show that the phylogenetic and ecological structure of the surrounding community can be important predictors of disease pressure. We found that the amount of tissue lost to disease increased with the relative abundance of a species across a grassland plant community, and that this rare-species advantage had an additional phylogenetic component: disease pressure was stronger on species with many close relatives. We used a global model of pathogen sharing as a function of relatedness between hosts, which provided a robust predictor of relative disease pressure at the local scale. In our grassland, the total amount of disease was most accurately explained not by the abundance of the focal host alone, but by the abundance of all species in the community weighted by their phylogenetic distance to the host. Furthermore, the model strongly predicted observed disease pressure for 44 novel host species we introduced experimentally to our study site, providing evidence for a mechanism to explain why phylogenetically rare species are more likely to become invasive when introduced(8,9). Our results demonstrate how the phylogenetic and ecological structure of communities can have a key role in disease dynamics, with implications for the maintenance of biodiversity, biotic resistance against introduced weeds, and the success of managed plants in agriculture and forestry.

TI  - A Remote Sensing Approach for Surface Urban Heat Island Modeling in a Tropical Colombian City Using Regression Analysis and Machine Learning Algorithms
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - The Surface Urban Heat Islands (SUHI) phenomenon has adverse environmental consequences on human activities, biophysical and ecological systems. In this study, Land Surface Temperature (LST) from Landsat and Sentinel-2 satellites is used to investigate the contribution of potential factors that generate the SUHI phenomenon. We employ Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) techniques to model the main temporal and spatial SUHI patterns of Cartago, Colombia, for the period 2001-2020. We test and evaluate the performance of three different emissivity models to retrieve LST. The fractional vegetation cover model using Sentinel-2 data provides the best results with R-2 = 0.78, while the ASTER Global Emissivity Dataset v3 and the land surface emissivity model provide R-2 = 0.27 and R-2 = 0.26, respectively. Our SUHI model reveals that the factors with the highest impact are the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and the Normalized Difference Build-up Index (NDBI). Furthermore, we incorporate a weighted Naive Bayes Machine Learning (NBML) algorithm to identify areas prone to extreme temperatures that can be used to define and apply normative actions to mitigate the negative consequences of SUHI. Our NBML approach demonstrates the suitability of the new SUHI model with uncertainty within 95%, against the 88% given by the Support Vector Machine (SVM) approach.

TI  - Predicting the Vulnerability of Great Apes to Disease: The Role of Superspreaders and Their Potential Vaccination
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Disease is a major concern for the conservation of great apes, and one that is likely to become increasingly relevant as deforestation and the rise of ecotourism bring humans and apes into ever closer proximity. Consequently, it is imperative that preventative measures are explored to ensure that future epidemics do not wipe out the remaining populations of these animals. In this paper, social network analysis was used to investigate vulnerability to disease in a population of wild orang-utans and a community of wild chimpanzees. Potential 'superspreaders' of disease - individuals with disproportionately central positions in the community or population - were identified, and the efficacy of vaccinating these individuals assessed using simulations. Three resident female orang-utans were identified as potential superspreaders, and females and unflanged males were predicted to be more influential in disease spread than flanged males. By contrast, no superspreaders were identified in the chimpanzee network, although males were significantly more central than females. In both species, simulating the vaccination of the most central individuals in the network caused a greater reduction in potential disease pathways than removing random individuals, but this effect was considerably more pronounced for orang-utans. This suggests that targeted vaccinations would have a greater impact on reducing disease spread among orang-utans than chimpanzees. Overall, these results have important implications for orang-utan and chimpanzee conservation and highlight the role that certain individuals may play in the spread of disease and its prevention by vaccination.

TI  - Adoption of community-based strategies for sustainable vector control and prevention
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Community engagement strategies provide tools for sustainable vector-borne disease control. A previous cluster randomized control trial engaged nine intervention communities in seven participatory activities to promote management of the domestic and peri-domestic environment to reduce risk factors for vector-borne Chagas disease. This study aims to assess the adoption of this innovative community-based strategy, which included chickens' management, indoor cleaning practices, and domestic rodent infestation control, using concepts from the Diffusion of Innovations Theory. We used questionnaires and semi-structured interviews to understand perceptions of knowledge gained, intervention adoption level, innovation attributes, and limiting or facilitating factors for adoption. The analysis process focused on five innovation attributes proposed by the Diffusion of Innovations Theory: relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, trialability, and observability. Rodent management was highly adopted by participants, as it had a relative advantage regarding the use of poison and was compatible with local practices. The higher complexity was reduced by offering several types of trapping systems and having practical workshops allowed trialability. Observability was limited because the traps were indoors, but information and traps were shared with neighbors. Chicken management was not as widely adopted due to the higher complexity of the method, and lower compatibility with local practices. Using the concepts proposed by the Diffusion of Innovations Theory helped us to identify the enablers and constraints in the implementation of the Chagas vector control strategy. Based on this experience, community engagement and intersectoral collaboration improve the acceptance and adoption of novel and integrated strategies to improve the prevention and control of neglected diseases.

TI  - Short Report: Isolation and Characterization of Sylvatic Mosquito-Borne Viruses in Trinidad: Enzootic Transmission and a New Potential Vector of Mucambo Virus
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Mosquito surveillance was carried out in three forested regions of Trinidad during July 2007 March 2009. A total of 185,397 mosquitoes representing at least 46 species was collected, divided into pools of 1-50 mosquitoes according to species and sex, and screened for arboviruses using cytopathic effect assays on Vero cell monolayers. Eighty-five viruses were isolated, including members of the genera Alphavirus (Mucambo virus; MUCV) and Orthobunyavirus (Caraparu, Oriboca, Bimiti, and Wyeomyia viruses). Species of the Culex. subgenus Melanoconion accounted for 56% of the total number of mosquitoes collected and 97% of the viruses isolated; Cx. (Mel.) portesi accounted for 92% of virus isolations. Our results also implicate for the first time Aedes (Ochlerotatus) hortator as a potential vector of MUCV. Phylogenetic analyses of 43 MUCV strains suggest population subdivision within Trinidad, consistent with the hypothesis of enzootic maintenance in localized rodent populations.

TI  - The disappearance of onchocerciasis from the Itwara focus, western Uganda after elimination of the vector <i>Simulium neavei</i> and 19 years of annual ivermectin treatments
T2  - ACTA TROPICA
AB  - The Itwara onchocerciasis focus is located around the Itwara forest reserve in western Uganda. In 1991, annual treatments with ivermectin started in the focus. They were supplemented in 1995 by the control of the vector Simulium neavei, which was subsequently eliminated from the focus. The impact of the two interventions on the disease was assessed in 2010 by nodule palpations, examinations of skin snips by microscopy and PCR, and Ov16 recombinant ELISA. There was no evidence of any microfilaria in 688 skin snips and only 2 (0.06%) of 3316 children examined for IgG4 were slightly above the arbitrary cut off of 40. A follow up of the same children 21 months later in 2012 confirmed that both were negative for diagnostic antigen Ov-16, skin snip microscopy and PCR. Based on the World Health Organization (WHO) elimination criteria of 2001 and the Uganda onchocerciasis certification guidelines, it was concluded that the disease has disappeared from the Itwara focus after 19 years of ivermectin treatments and the elimination of the vector around 2001. Ivermectin treatments were recommended to be halted. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - C5 induces different cell death pathways in promastigotes of <i>Leishmania</i> <i>amazonensis</i>
T2  - CHEMICO-BIOLOGICAL INTERACTIONS
AB  - Leishmaniasis is a neglected infection that is caused by Leishmania protozoa, affecting millions of people worldwide, mainly in tropical and subtropical regions. This disease has different clinical forms: cutaneous, mucocutaneous, and visceral. The drugs that are currently available for the treatment of this infection have limitations, such as high toxicity, long-term treatment, and leads to drug-resistant strains. Numerous studies, in various experimental models, have sought to develop more effective and less toxic chemotherapeutic agents against leishmaniasis. In the present study, we evaluated the mechanism of cell death that is induced by n-benzyl 1-(4-methoxy)phenyl-9H-beta-carboline-3-carboxamide (C5) against Leishmania amazonensis. C5 increased reactive oxygen species production, depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane, DNA fragmentation, decrease of cell volume, lipoperoxidation, the accumulation of lipid bodies, and acidic vesicular organelles (AVOs) and caused the intense formation of autophagic compartments in L. amazonensis promastigotes. The results indicate that C5 causes L. amazonensis death through different pathways. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Phylogeography and demographic history of the Chagas disease vector <i>Rhodnius nasutus</i> (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) in the Brazilian Caatinga biome
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   Rhodnius nasutus, a vector of the etiological agent Trypanosoma cruzi, is one of the epidemiologically most relevant triatomine species of the Brazilian Caatinga, where it often colonizes rural peridomestic structures such as chicken coops and occasionally invades houses. Historical colonization and determination of its genetic diversity and population structure may provide new information towards the improvement of vector control in the region. In this paper we present thoughtful analyses considering the phylogeography and demographic history of R. nasutus in the Caatinga.
   Methodology/Principal findings
   A total of 157 R. nasutus specimens were collected from Copernicia prunifera palm trees in eight geographic localities within the Brazilian Caatinga biome, sequenced for 595-bp fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene (cyt b) and genotyped for eight microsatellite loci. Sixteen hap lotypes were detected in the cyt b sequences, two of which were shared between different localities. Molecular diversity indices exhibited low diversity and a haplotype network revealed low divergence among R. nasutus sequences, with two central haplotypes shared by five of the eight populations analyzed. The demographic model that better represented R. nasutus population dynamics was the exponential growth model. Results of the microsatellite data analyses indicated that the entire population is comprised of four highly differentiated groups, with no obvious contemporary geographic barriers that could explain the population substructure detected. A complex pattern of migration was observed, in which a western Caatinga population seems to be the source of emigrants to the eastern populations.
   Conclusions/Significance
   R. nasutus that inhabit C. prunifera palms do not comprise a species complex. The species went through a population expansion at 12-10 ka, during the Holocene, which coincides with end of the largest dry season in South America. It colonized the Caatinga in a process that occurred from west to east in the region. R. nasutus is presently facing an important ecological impact caused by the continuous deforestation of C. prunifera palms in northeast Brazil. We hypothesize that this ecological disturbance might contribute to an increase in the events of invasion and colonization of human habitations.

TI  - Out of the deep: Cryptic speciation in a Neotropical gecko (Squamata, Phyllodactylidae) revealed by species delimitation methods
T2  - MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION
AB  - Levels of biodiversity in the Neotropics are largely underestimated despite centuries of research interest in this region. This is particularly true for the Cerrado, the largest Neotropical savanna and a formally recognized biodiversity hotspot. Molecular species delimitation methods have become essential tools to uncover cryptic species and can be notably robust when coupled with morphological information. We present the first evaluation of the monophyly and cryptic speciation of a widespread Cerrado endemic lizard, Gymnodactylus amarali, using phylogenetic and species-trees methods, as well as a coalescent-based Bayesian species delimitation method. We tested whether lineages resulting from the analyses of molecular data are morphologically diagnosed by traditional meristic scale characters. We recovered eight deeply divergent molecular clades within G. amarali, and two additional ones from seasonally dry tropical forest enclaves between the Cerrado and the Caatinga biomes. Analysis of morphological data statistically corroborated the molecular delimitation for all groups, in a pioneering example of the use of support vector machines to investigate morphological differences in animals. The eight G. amarali clades appear monophyletic and endemic to the Cerrado. They display several different properties used by biologists to delineate species and are therefore considered here as candidates for formal taxonomic description. We also present a preliminary account of the biogeographic history of these lineages in the Cerrado, evidence for speciation of sister lineages in the Cerrado-Caatinga contact, and highlight the need for further morphological and genetic studies to assess cryptic diversity in this biodiversity hotspot.

TI  - Spatial epidemiology of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Colombia: socioeconomic and demographic factors associated with a growing epidemic
T2  - TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Background: Despite the identification of some environmental factors linked to the cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) epidemic, little is known about the impact of environmental disturbances caused by human activities. We assessed the association between socioeconomic and demographic factors with the spatial structure of the CL epidemic in Colombia.
   Methods: Using data from more than 65 000 CL cases collected across the entire country from publicly available sources, we conducted a spatial clustering analysis to identify high burden areas (clusters) of CL. Associations between CL clusters and socioeconomic variables were investigated.
   Results: We identified seven statistically significant clusters of CL located across all Colombian biomes. Deforestation and livestock were statistically significantly associated with the spatial clustering of CL. Urbanization, time spent traveling to main cities and water bodies were other factors linked with the clustering of CL.
   Conclusions: This study found that human activities such as deforestation linked to agriculture, livestock production and mining activities are key drivers of the spatial distribution of the CL epidemic. The intensity of these human activities, which are projected to increase because of social and economic transformations in progress in Colombia, will potentially exacerbate the already growing CL epidemic in the country.

TI  - Epidemiology of Human Leptospirosis in French Guiana (2007-2014): A Retrospective Study
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Leptospirosis is a worldwide zoonotic bacterial infection with a rising incidence. French Guiana is mostly covered by Amazonian rain forest. Despite a potentially favorable environment, leptospirosis has been barely studied in French Guiana. The objective of this study was to describe the current trends of leptospirosis epidemiology in French Guiana. A cross-sectional study was performed in the two main hospitals of French Guiana. Cases of leptospirosis from 2007 to 2014 were retrospectively identified with a systematic screening of serological and polymerase chain reaction results to classify them as confirmed, probable, or excluded cases. Medical files were reviewed to collect epidemiological data. Among the 72 included patients, 55 (76.4%) cases were confirmed and 17 (23.6%) were probable. The median age was 39 years (range: 16-82 years) and the M/F sex ratio 6.2. Sixty-two(86.1%) patients required hospitalization, including 12 (16.7%) in the intensive care unit. Three (4.2%) patients died. The monthly distribution of cases was correlated with rainfall (P = 0.004) and moisture (P = 0.038). Professional exposure was frequently identified (especially gold mining and construction). Among 16 different serogroups identified by microagglutination test, Icterohaemorrhagiae was the most frequent (38.0%). This study revealed an epidemiology close to that observed in Brazilian regions, and professional and climatic risk factors. The high diversity of serogroups may reveal a complex environmental reservoir requiring further investigations. Only 20% of leptospirosis patients were suspected as such on hospital admission, thus emphasizing the need to inform local physicians.

TI  - Socio-Economic and Cultural Determinants of Human African Trypanosomiasis at the Kenya - Uganda Transboundary
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background: Kenya and Uganda have reported different Human African Trypanosomiasis incidences in the past more than three decades, with the latter recording more cases. This cross-sectional study assessed the demographic characteristics, tsetse and trypanosomiasis control practices, socio-economic and cultural risk factors influencing Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense (T.b.r.) infection in Teso and Busia Districts, Western Kenya and Tororo and Busia Districts, Southeast Uganda. A conceptual framework was postulated to explain interactions of various socio-economic, cultural and tsetse control factors that predispose individuals and populations to HAT.
   Methods: A cross-sectional household survey was conducted between April and October 2008. Four administrative districts reporting T.b.r and lying adjacent to each other at the international boundary of Kenya and Uganda were purposely selected. Household data collection was carried out in two villages that had experienced HAT and one other village that had no reported HAT case from 1977 to 2008 in each district. A structured questionnaire was administered to 384 randomly selected household heads or their representatives in each country. The percent of respondents giving a specific answer was reported. Secondary data was also obtained on socio-economic and political issues in both countries.
   Results: Inadequate knowledge on the disease cycle and intervention measures contributed considerable barriers to HAT, and more so in Uganda than in Kenya. Gender-associated socio-cultural practices greatly predisposed individuals to HAT. Pesticides-based crop husbandry in the 1970's reportedly reduced vector population while vegetation of coffee and banana's and livestock husbandry directly increased occurrence of HAT. Livestock husbandry practices in the villages were strong predictors of HAT incidence. The residents in Kenya (6.7%) applied chemoprophylaxis and chemotherapeutic controls against trypanosomiasis to a larger extent than Uganda (2.1%).
   Conclusion: Knowledge on tsetse and its control methods, culture, farming practice, demographic and socio-economic variables explained occurrence of HAT better than landscape features.

TI  - In and Out the Amazonia: Evolutionary Ecomorphology in Howler and Capuchin Monkeys
T2  - EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY
AB  - The impact of environmental variation on phenotypic diversification is one major issue in evolutionary studies. Environmental variation is thought to be a primary factor in evolution, especially at high latitudes. In contrast, tropical areas are traditionally viewed as the cradle where the long-term effects of biological interactions on phenotypic change reside. We analyse patterns of skull shape variation in two New World monkey groups: capuchins and howlers. These two monophyletic clades are exceptionally similar in terms of the geographic distribution of their species. Yet, their body size and diet are different: howler monkeys are large and almost exclusively folivorous, whereas capuchins are small omnivorous. We found that the size, and direction of vectors of phenotypic changes across South American biomes in those clades are not statistically different. This similarity persists after removing the strong impact of allometry in our data. Additionally, partial least squares and comparative analyses confirm that "allometry free" skull shape is influenced to the same set of environmental variables in both clades. This study remarks the paramount importance of both body size and environmental variation on phenotypic evolution.

TI  - Diverse novel phleboviruses in sandflies from the Panama Canal area, Central Panama
T2  - JOURNAL OF GENERAL VIROLOGY
AB  - The genus Phlebovirus (order Bunyavirales, family Phenuiviridae) comprises 57 viruses that are grouped into nine species-complexes. Sandfly-transmitted phleboviruses are found in Europe, Africa and the Americas and are responsible for febrile illness and infections of the nervous system in humans. The aim of this study was to assess the genetic diversity of sandfly-transmitted phleboviruses in connected and isolated forest habitats throughout the Panama Canal area in Central Panama. In total, we collected 13 807 sandflies comprising eight phlebotomine species. We detected several strains pertaining to five previously unknown viruses showing maximum pairwise identities of 45-78 % to the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase genes of phleboviruses. Entire coding regions were directly sequenced from infected sandflies as virus isolation in cell culture was not successful. The viruses were tentatively named La Gloria virus (LAGV). Mona Grita virus (MOGV), Pena Blanca virus (PEBV), Tico virus (TICV) and Tres Almendras virus (TRAV). Inferred phylogenies and p-distance-based analyses revealed that PEBV groups with the Bujaru phlebovirus species-complex, TRAV with the Candiru phlebovirus species-complex and MOGV belongs to the proposed Icoarci phlebovirus species-complex, whereas LAGV and TICV seem to be distant members of the Bujaru phlebovirus species-complex. No specific vector or habitat association was found for any of the five viruses. Relative abundance of sandflies was similar over habitat types. Our study shows that blood-feeding insects originating from remote and biodiverse habitats harbour multiple previously unknown phleboviruses. These viruses should be included in future surveillance studies to assess their geographic distribution and to elucidate if these viruses cause symptoms of disease in animals or humans.

TI  - Elucidation of distribution patterns and possible infection routes of the neurotropic black yeast <i>Exophiala dermatitidis</i> using AFLP
T2  - FUNGAL BIOLOGY
AB  - Distribution of populations of the opportunistic black yeast Exophiala dermatitidis was studied using AFLP. This fungus has been hypothesized to have a natural habitat in association with frugivorous birds and bats in the tropical rain forest, and to emerge in the human-dominated environment, where it occasionally causes human pulmonary or fatal disseminated and neurotropic disease. The hypothesis of its natural niche was investigated by comparing a set of 178 strains from natural and human-dominated environments in Thailand with a worldwide selection of 107 strains from the reference collection of the CBS Fungal Biodiversity Centre, comprising 75.7 % clinical isolates. Many isolates had unique AFLP patterns and were too remote for confident comparison. Eight populations containing multiple isolates could be distinguished, enabling determination of geographic distributions of these populations. Some of the populations were confined to Thailand, while others occurred worldwide. The local populations from Thailand contained strains from natural and urban environments, suggesting an environmental jump of the fungus. Strains from human brain belonged to widely dispersed populations. In some cases cerebral isolates were identical to isolates from the human intestinal tract. The possibility of cerebral infection through intestinal translocation was thus not excluded. (C) 2010 British Mycological Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Patterns of Locally- Acquired Dengue Transmission in Northern Queensland, Australia, 1993-2012
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Background: Dengue has been a major public health concern in Australia since it re- emerged in Queensland in 1992- 1993. We explored spatio- temporal characteristics of locally- acquired dengue cases in northern tropical Queensland, Australia during the period 1993- 2012.
   Methods: Locally- acquired notified cases of dengue were collected for northern tropical Queensland from 1993 to 2012. Descriptive spatial and temporal analyses were conducted using geographic information system tools and geostatistical techniques.
   Results: 2,398 locally- acquired dengue cases were recorded in northern tropical Queensland during the study period. The areas affected by the dengue cases exhibited spatial and temporal variation over the study period. Notified cases of dengue occurred more frequently in autumn. Mapping of dengue by statistical local areas ( census units) reveals the presence of substantial spatio- temporal variation over time and place. Statistically significant differences in dengue incidence rates among males and females ( with more cases in females) ( chi 2 = 15.17, d. f. = 1, p < 0.01). Differences were observed among age groups, but these were not statistically significant. There was a significant positive spatial autocorrelation of dengue incidence for the four sub- periods, with the Moran's I statistic ranging from 0.011 to 0.463 ( p < 0.01). Semi- variogram analysis and smoothed maps created from interpolation techniques indicate that the pattern of spatial autocorrelation was not homogeneous across the northern Queensland.
   Conclusions: Tropical areas are potential high- risk areas for mosquito- borne diseases such as dengue. This study demonstrated that the locally- acquired dengue cases have exhibited a spatial and temporal variation over the past twenty years in northern tropical Queensland, Australia. Therefore, this study provides an impetus for further investigation of clusters and risk factors in these high- risk areas.

TI  - Epidemiology and integrated management of web blight in bamboo nurseries in India
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 4TH MEETING OF IUFRO WORKING PARTY 7.03.04 - DISEASE AND INSECTS IN FOREST NURSERIES
CP  - 4th Meeting of the IUFRO Working Party 7 03 04
AB  - Bamboos are vulnerable to various diseases which affect them in nurseries, plantations and natural stands. Among various. seedling diseases recorded on bamboos, web blight caused by Rhizodonia solani is the most damaging and widespread in bamboo nurseries. The disease is influenced greatly by the microclimatic conditions in the nursery, viz. soil moisture, ambient temperature, relative humidity, incident light over the seedbeds and seedling density. Due to the high humid tropical climate prevailing in the State and existence of different virulent strains of R. solani resistant to fungicides, disease management becomes more difficult. Epidemiology of the disease was studied and to adopt an integrated strategy for disease management employing cultural, biological and chemical measures, studies were carried out. Characterization of R. solani isolates made from bamboo nurseries throughout the State revealed that R. solani exists in at least three anastamosis groups, AG 1-IA, AG 1-IC, AG 2-2IV, which varied in cultural characters, growth, virulence, and also showed varying levels of fungicidal resistance. To achieve biological control using antagonistic organisms, Trichoderma harzianum and T viride isolates from local nursery soil were screened against R. solani isolates employing different techniques and efficient candidate antagonists were selected for mass culturing and inoculum production. Ten fungicides were screened against different strains of R. solani in the laboratory and the most efficient ones were selected for the nursery trials. Biological control measures applied in nursery include solarization of the seedbeds for 18 days and introduction of T harzianum and T. viride by two delivery methods, soil amendment and seed coating. Cultural measures include regulation of soil water regime in the seedbed, shade over the seedbed and seedling density. Prophylactic fungicidal treatments were also given separately. All the treatments were made at different levels and disease monitoring and data on incidence, severity and spread of the disease were recorded. Area under disease progress curve (AUDPC) and growth rate of disease were recorded for each treatment. The study revealed that soil solarization and introduction of antagonists were not effective in controlling the disease. Optimizing the cultural measures by manipulating shade over the seedbeds (without shade), reducing seed rate (<165g m(-2)), and regulating water regime in the seedbed (101 m(-2) per day), along with prophylactic application of fungicide (carboxin 0.2% a. i.) after one and three weeks of seedling emergence, web blight disease can be effectively managed.

TI  - Range-wide declines of a key Neotropical ecosystem architect, the Near Threatened white-lipped peccary <i>Tayassu pecari</i>
T2  - ORYX
AB  - We report a range-wide status assessment of a key Neotropical ecosystem architect, the white-lipped peccary Tayassu pecari, categorized as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List, using published information and unpublished data from 41 scientists in 15 range countries. We estimate that the white-lipped peccary has been extirpated in 21% of its historical range over the last 100 years, with reduced abundance and a low to medium probability of long-term survival in another 48% of its current range. We found major range declines in Argentina, Paraguay, southern Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela, north-east Brazil, Mexico and Costa Rica. This species is particularly at risk in more xeric ecosystems, especially the caatinga, cerrado and pampas. Hunting and habitat destruction are the most severe threats, although there are also unexplained sudden die-offs suggestive of disease. We evaluate our results in light of this species' important interspecific interactions and its role as an ecosystem architect. One of our recommendations is that conservation efforts should focus on landscape conservation of large, continuous and ecologically intact areas containing a mosaic of different habitat types.

TI  - Virulence of <i>Rigidoporus microporus</i> Isolates Causing White Root Rot Disease on Rubber Trees (<i>Hevea brasiliensis</i>) in Malaysia
T2  - PLANTS-BASEL
AB  - Latex production from Hevea brasiliensis rubber tree is the second most important commodity in Malaysia, but this industry is threatened by the white root rot disease (WRD) caused by Rigidoporus microporus that leads to considerable latex yield loss and tree death. This study aimed to characterize and compare the virulence of five R. microporus isolates obtained from infected rubber trees located at different states in Malaysia. These isolates were subjected to morphological and molecular characterization for species confirmation and pathogenicity test for the determination of virulence level. BLAST search showed that the ITS sequences of all the pathogen isolates were 99% identical to R. microporus isolate SEG (accession number: MG199553) from Malaysia. The pathogenicity test of R. microporus isolates conducted in a nursery with 24 seedlings per isolate showed that isolate RL21 from Sarawak has developed the most severe above- and below-ground symptoms of WRD on the rubber clone RRIM600 as host. Six months after being infected with R. microporus, RL21 was evaluated with the highest average of disease severity index of 80.52% for above- and below-ground symptoms, followed by RL22 (68.65%), RL20 (66.04%), RL26 (54.38%), and RL25 (43.13%). The in vitro growth condition tests showed that isolate RL21 of R. microporus has optimum growth at 25-30 degrees C, with the preference of weakly acidic to neutral environments (pH 6-7). This study revealed that different virulence levels are possessed among different R. microporus isolates even though they were isolated from the same host species under the same climate region. Taken together, field evaluation through visual observation and laboratory assays have led to screening of the most virulent isolate. Determination of the most virulent isolate in the present study is vital and shall be taken into consideration for the selection of suitable pathogen isolate in the development of more effective control measures in combating tenacious R. microporus.

TI  - Amplification, sequencing and characterization of pectin methyl esterase inhibitor 51 gene in Tectona grandis L.f.
T2  - SAUDI JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB  - Tectona grandis L.f. (Teak), a very important source of incomparable timber, withstands a wide range of tropical deciduous conditions. We achieved partial amplification of pectin methylesterase inhibitor 51 (PMEI) gene in teak by E. pilularis cinnamoyl Co-A reductase (CCR) gene specific primer. The amplified teak gene was of 750 bp, 79% identity and 97% query cover with PMEI of Sesamum indicum. The phylogenetic tree clustered the amplified gene with PMEI of database plant species, Erythranthe guttata and Sesamum indicum (87% bootstrap value). On conversion to amino acid sequence, the obtained protein comprised 237 amino acids. However, PMEI region spanned from 24 to 171 amino acids, 15.94 kDa molecular weight, 8.97 pI value and C697H1117N199O211S9 molecular formula with four conserved cysteine residues as disulfide bridges. 25.9% protein residues were hydrophilic, 42.7% hydrophobic and 31.2% neutral. Teak 3D PMEI protein structure corresponded well with Arabidopsis thaliana and Actinidia deliciosa PMEIs. The gene maintains integrity of pectin component of middle lamella of primary cell wall and confers tolerance against various kinds of stresses. Teak conferred with overexpression of PMEI may secure a wide adaptability as well as luxuriant timber productivity and quality in adverse/ fluctuating/ scarce climatic and environmental conditions of tropical forests.

TI  - Mayaro virus: a neglected arbovirus of the Americas
T2  - FUTURE VIROLOGY
AB  - Mayaro virus is a neglected tropical arbovirus that causes a mild, self-limited febrile syndrome, sometimes accompanied by a highly incapacitating arthralgia. First isolated in Trinidad and Tobago in 1954, it was reported in several countries within the tropical regions of South and Central America. Human infections are accidental spillover of the enzootic cycle. Little epidemiological data are available due to inadequate surveillance and the generic nature of clinical manifestations resulting in the misdiagnosis with other viral fevers. Despite its restricted distribution, Mayaro fever may become a public health issue due to their urbanization potential. Accurate epidemiological data are urgently needed to access the real distribution of this virus guiding public health policies better.

TI  - Changes in abundance and behaviour of vector mosquitoes induced by land use during the development of an oil palm plantation in Sarawak
T2  - TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Surveys a ere conducted of adult and immature mosquitoes in an area undergoing oil palm development in north Sarawak. Point prevalence data from 2 sites were collected annually, coinciding with annual phases of forest clearing, burning/cultivation, and maintenance. Major habitat perturbation during the forest/clearing transition shifted the major mosquito faunal equilibrium in terms of species composition, relative density and occurrence. Analyses of variance showed that the mean numbers of 4 species of Anopheles decreased significantly after forest clearing. Relative densities of immature stages decreased after forest clearing, but A. letifer and Culex tritaeniorhynchus remained relatively unchanged after the second year. Comparisons with the pre-development forest stage showed that the reductions in person-biting rates, adult survival and combined entomological inoculation rates (EIR) of A. donaldi and A. letifer decreased the risk of malaria transmission by 90% over the 4 years period. Concomitant reductions in EIR and annual malaria incidence were also correlated. This study highlighted the 'law of unintended consequences', since 2 contrasting effects were observed: reduction of malaria vectors but concomitant increase of dengue vectors.

AB  - Cryphonectria canker, caused by Cryphonectria cubensis, has limited the development of new Eucalyptus plantations in tropical and subtropical regions. The pathogen is commonly found on Eucalyptus, but its occurrence on other hosts in the Myrtaceae has also been documented. In this study, C. cubensis is reported as the causal agent of a serious canker disease on Tibouchina spp. (Melastomataceae) in Colombia. We used morphological studies, pathogenicity tests on Eucalyptus and Tibouchina, and a phylogenetic study using partial ribosomal DNA sequence data. This is the first record of C. cubensis on a host outside the Myrtaceae.

TI  - Update of the Phlebotominae Fauna with New Records for Argentina and Observations on Leishmaniasis Transmission Scenarios at a Regional Scale
T2  - NEOTROPICAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - Phlebotominae are small insects distributed in the Americas from Canada to Argentina and Uruguay, counting with more than 500 neotropical species. Some of them have a vectorial role in the transmission of Leishmania Ross, the causative agent of leishmaniases, a group of worldwide distributed diseases with different clinical manifestations and transmission cycles. Our aim was to update the Phlebotominae fauna of Argentina and to make observations on the American Cutaneous (ACL) and Visceral Leishmaniasis (AVL) transmission scenarios, according to the distribution of proven or suspected Leishmania vector species and recent changes in land use. Primary data (entomological captures) and secondary data (review of 65 scientific publications with Phlebotominae records) were used. With 9 new records, 46 Phlebotominae species are now recorded through the area comprising 14 political jurisdictions and 6 phytogeographic provinces. Distribution maps were constructed for the 5 proven or incriminated Leishmania vector species, and the evidence supporting the vectorial incrimination of these species is discussed. Three main ACL transmission scenarios are described in the phytogeographic provinces of the Yungas, Chaco, and Paranaense, associated with deforestation processes, while the transmission scenarios of AVL are urban outbreaks and scattered cases in rural areas. We update the available knowledge on the Phlebotominae fauna present in Argentina, emphasizing its epidemiological relevance in the current context of the increasing frequency of ACL outbreaks and geographic spread of AVL.

TI  - Impending extinction crisis of the world's primates: Why primates matter
T2  - SCIENCE ADVANCES
AB  - Nonhuman primates, our closest biological relatives, play important roles in the livelihoods, cultures, and religions of many societies and offer unique insights into human evolution, biology, behavior, and the threat of emerging diseases. They are an essential component of tropical biodiversity, contributing to forest regeneration and ecosystem health. Current information shows the existence of 504 species in 79 genera distributed in the Neotropics, mainland Africa, Madagascar, and Asia. Alarmingly, similar to 60% of primate species are now threatened with extinction and similar to 75% have declining populations. This situation is the result of escalating anthropogenic pressures on primates and their habitats-mainly global and local market demands, leading to extensive habitat loss through the expansion of industrial agriculture, large-scale cattle ranching, logging, oil and gas drilling, mining, dam building, and the construction of new road networks in primate range regions. Other important drivers are increased bushmeat hunting and the illegal trade of primates as pets and primate body parts, along with emerging threats, such as climate change and anthroponotic diseases. Often, these pressures act in synergy, exacerbating primate population declines. Given that primate range regions overlap extensively with a large, and rapidly growing, human population characterized by high levels of poverty, global attention is needed immediately to reverse the looming risk of primate extinctions and to attend to local human needs in sustainable ways. Raising global scientific and public awareness of the plight of the world's primates and the costs of their loss to ecosystem health and human society is imperative.

TI  - Tree Spatial Structure, Host Composition and Resource Availability Influence Mirid Density or Black Pod Prevalence in Cacao Agroforests in Cameroon
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Combining crop plants with other plant species in agro-ecosystems is one way to enhance ecological pest and disease regulation mechanisms. Resource availability and microclimatic variation mechanisms affect processes related to pest and pathogen life cycles. These mechanisms are supported both by empirical research and by epidemiological models, yet their relative importance in a real complex agro-ecosystem is still not known. Our aim was thus to assess the independent effects and the relative importance of different variables related to resource availability and microclimatic variation that explain pest and disease occurrence at the plot scale in real complex agro-ecosystems. The study was conducted in cacao (Theobroma cacao) agroforests in Cameroon, where cocoa production is mainly impacted by the mirid bug, Sahlbergella singularis, and black pod disease, caused by Phytophthora megakarya. Vegetation composition and spatial structure, resource availability and pest and disease occurrence were characterized in 20 real agroforest plots. Hierarchical partitioning was used to identify the causal variables that explain mirid density and black pod prevalence. The results of this study show that cacao agroforests can be differentiated on the basis of vegetation composition and spatial structure. This original approach revealed that mirid density decreased when a minimum number of randomly distributed forest trees were present compared with the aggregated distribution of forest trees, or when forest tree density was low. Moreover, a decrease in mirid density was also related to decreased availability of sensitive tissue, independently of the effect of forest tree structure. Contrary to expectations, black pod prevalence decreased with increasing cacao tree abundance. By revealing the effects of vegetation composition and spatial structure on mirids and black pod, this study opens new perspectives for the joint agro-ecological management of cacao pests and diseases at the plot scale, through the optimization of the spatial structure and composition of the vegetation.

TI  - Malaria ecology along the Thailand-Myanmar border
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
AB  - Background: Malaria in Southeast Asia frequently clusters along international borders. For example, while most of Thailand is malaria free, the border region shared with Myanmar continues to have endemic malaria. This spatial pattern is the result of complex interactions between landscape, humans, mosquito vectors, and malaria parasites. An understanding of these complex ecological and socio-cultural interactions is important for designing and implementing malaria elimination efforts in the region. This article offers an ecological perspective on the malaria situation along the Thailand-Myanmar border.
   Discussion: This border region is long (2000 km), mountainous, and the environment ranges from thick forests to growing urban settlements and wet-rice fields. It is also a biologically diverse region. All five species of malaria known to naturally infect humans are present. At least three mosquito vector species complexes, with widely varying behavioural characteristics, exist in the area. The region is also a hub for ethnic diversity, being home to over ten different ethnolinguistic groups, several of which have been engaged in conflict with the Myanmar government now for over half a century. Given the biological and ethnic diversity, as well as the complex socio-political context, malaria control and elimination in the region is challenging.
   Conclusion: Despite these complexities, multipronged approaches including collaborations with multiple local organizations, quick access to diagnosis and treatment, prevention of mosquito bites, radical cure of parasites, and mass drug administration appear to be drastically decreasing Plasmodium falciparum infections. Such approaches remain crucial as the region moves toward elimination of P. falciparum and potentially Plasmodium vivax.

TI  - Spatial Optimization Methods for Malaria Risk Mapping in Sub-Saharan African Cities Using Demographic and Health Surveys
T2  - GEOHEALTH
AB  - Vector-borne diseases, such as malaria, are affected by the rapid urban growth and climate change in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). In this context, intra-urban malaria risk maps act as a key decision-making tool for targeting malaria control interventions, especially in resource-limited settings. The Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) provide a consistent malaria data source for mapping malaria risk at the national scale, but their use is limited at the intra-urban scale because survey cluster coordinates are randomly displaced for ethical reasons. In this research, we focus on predicting intra-urban malaria risk in SSA cities-Dakar, Dar es Salaam, Kampala and Ouagadougou-and investigate the use of spatial optimization methods to overcome the effect of DHS spatial displacement. We modeled malaria risk using a random forest regressor and remotely sensed covariates depicting the urban climate, the land cover and the land use, and we tested several spatial optimization approaches. The use of spatial optimization mitigated the effects of DHS spatial displacement on predictive performance. However, this comes at a higher computational cost, and the percentage of variance explained in our models remained low (around 30%-40%), which suggests that these methods cannot entirely overcome the limited quality of epidemiological data. Building on our results, we highlight potential adaptations to the DHS sampling strategy that would make them more reliable for predicting malaria risk at the intra-urban scale.
   Global climate change and rapid urbanization in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are likely to affect the epidemiology of vector-borne diseases such as malaria in urban and peri-urban areas. In this context, a better understanding of intra-urban malaria risk and its determinants has become even more urgent. Malaria risk has often been modeled at the national scale from Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), which are periodically conducted in more than 90 developing countries. However, survey cluster coordinates in DHS are randomly displaced by up to 2 km in urban areas to protect respondent privacy, which reduces the accuracy of malaria models and risk maps at the intra-urban scale. In this study, we tested the potential of spatial optimization methods to overcome the effect of DHS displacement. We found that spatial optimization methods improved the performance of malaria models, but the improvement in performance is small for a higher computational cost. With these methods, we predicted malaria risk in several SSA cities (Dakar, Dar es Salaam, Kampala and Ouagadougou). We expect the quality and quantity of available data on malaria and other vector-borne diseases to improve in the future, which will certainly make these methods extremely useful in the fight against these diseases.

TI  - Evaluating the potential of soil management to reduce the effect of <i>Fusarium oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>cubense</i> in banana (<i>Musa</i> AAA)
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PATHOLOGY
AB  - Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (Foc) causes Fusarium wilt in banana (Musa AAA). Foc Race 1 devastated the subgroup Gros Michel during the first half of the twentieth century. The Gros Michel was largely replaced by the resistant subgroup Cavendish in the 1950s. However, in the 1980s, Foc Tropical Race 4 started to spread affecting Cavendish bananas. No proper control measures have been found to deal with the disease. This paper re-takes an important research line from the 1950s to evaluate the potential of soil management for Fusarium wilt management. The role of soil properties on Fusarium wilt in bananas was studied in two greenhouse experiments. It was evaluated whether the influence of two main soil properties (pH and N) on Fusarium wilt is similar for Race 1 and Tropical Race 4. Two soil pH levels (lower than 5.2 and higher than 6.0) respectively ensured through acidification and liming; and three levels of N (ammonium nitrate, 33.5% N) weekly doses (low:0 N g, medium: 0.08 N g and high: 0.25 N g per plant) were achieved. The first experiment in Costa Rica confirmed the earlier results about the influence of soil pH and nitrogen on Fusarium wilt (Race 1) on Gros Michel bananas. The second experiment in The Netherlands evaluated the influence of pH and N on interactions between Foc (both Race 1 and Tropical Race 4) and Cavendish bananas. Results in both experiments showed that soil pH affected crop development and the disease. Besides, the interaction of the lower pH x the higher N accelerated the infection and reduced plant development. As such, the results showed that soil management has the potential to reduce the impacts of Fusarium wilt while dealing with Race 1 and Tropical Race 4 although it requires confirmation and further evaluation under field conditions.

TI  - Towards Achieving Optimal Performance using Stacked Generalization Algorithm: A Case Study of Clinical Diagnosis of Malaria Fever
T2  - INTERNATIONAL ARAB JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
AB  - The birth of data mining has been a blessing to all fields of endeavours and there are numerous data mining algorithms available today. One of the major problems of mining data is the selection of the appropriate algorithm or model for a job at hand; this has led to different comparison experiments by researchers. Stacked Generalization is one of the methods of combining multiple models to give a better accuracy. The method has been investigated to be effective by many researchers over the years. This study investigates how optimal performance could be achieved using Stacked Generalization algorithm. Six different data mining algorithms (PART, REP Tree, J48, Random Tree, RIDOR and JRIP) arranged in two different orders were used as base learners to two different Meta Learners (Random Forest and NNGE) independently and the results obtained were compared in terms of classification accuracy. The study shows that the order of arrangement of the base learners and the choice of Meta Learner could affect the accuracy of the Stacked Generalization method; NNGE outperforms Random Forest as a Meta-Learner and its performance is independent of the order of arrangement of the base learners as against Random Forest. Malaria fever datasets collected from reputable hospitals in Ado-Ekiti, Ekiti State, Nigeria were purposefully used for this study because malaria is one of the major diseases killing almost a million people yearly in the tropical region of Africa, so a more accurate malaria fever diagnosis model is as well proposed as a result of this study.

TI  - Paths to sustainable wood supply to the pulp and paper industry in Indonesia after diseases have forced a change of species from acacia to eucalypts
T2  - AUSTRALIAN FORESTRY
AB  - In Sumatra and Kalimantan in Indonesia and Sabah in Malaysia, the spread of two diseases, aggravated by damage by fauna, and by the humid tropical environment, has forced a change of planted species from Acacia mangium to Eucalyptus pellita and related interspecific hybrids, at a scale unprecedented in the history of plantation forestry. This experience highlights the risks of relying on any single species for large contiguous plantation estates in environments with endemic biotic and abiotic stresses. There is a need to transition to multiple-species plantation forestry, adopting the opportunities for changeover of species and varieties in short-rotation systems. Industry's responses for coping with this rapid change have been helped by earlier collaborative research on acacia which promoted management practices that conserved site resources and avoided site degradation during the critical harvesting and inter-rotation phase. The current growth rates of E. pellita and its hybrids are lower than that of A. mangium. Estimates of production from plantations and expanding capacity of the pulp and paper mills highlight a risk of significant shortfalls in wood production. Improving the quality and consistency of forest operations and revision and refocussing of research and development are critical to set and achieve realistic targets for stable, incremental improvements in productivity. Each company should consider investing systematically in contemporary adaptive research for developing and applying integrated management practices that are efficient and feasible on large scales and suitable for their circumstances. There is also a critical need for research to understand the dynamics of local human capital and its relationships with the forestry sector, with focus on improving access to a stable labour force.

TI  - Therapeutic potential of Indian medicinal plants against <i>Leishmania donovani</i>: a review
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE INDIAN NATIONAL SCIENCE ACADEMY
AB  - A prevalent medical condition in the tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world, Leishmaniasis; due to the unavailability of effective drugs, caters the need for its eradication and therapeutic control. Modern-day pentavalent antimonials such as Sodium Stibogluconate, Miltefosine used for disease treatment are costly and have low efficacy, apart from triggering severe side effects after prolonged treatment. Plants offer active natural components that have miraculous medicinal properties such as antimicrobial, antimalarial, and even antileishmanial. In this review, research articles on Indian medicinal plants effective against visceral leishmaniasis causal organism, Leishmania donovani, from several renowned domains from 1900s to 20th century were thoroughly studied and the results discussed. Among the 16 plant families from over 50 articles, Piperaceae has been found to treasure plant species with potent leishmanicidal chemical constituents, followed by Meliaceae. The review highlights the plant derived biologically active extracts, essential oils, and isolated compounds effective against the parasite both in vitro and in vivo. While Plumbago zeylanica was found to be the most effective in vitro, momordicatin from Momordica charantia lead to 100% parasite clearance at 10 mg/kg body weight dosage in infected hamsters. The course of study revealed that apart from directly inhibiting parasite growth, plant extracts also led to phosphatidylserine externalization, DNA fragmentation, cell cycle arrest and a significant increase in ROS and pro- inflammatory cytokines expression as well. This article can be further utilized for the selection of naturally derived drugs for clinical trials and their successful use as effective anti-leishmanial medicines.

TI  - Patterns of diversification in the high Andean Ponderacris grasshoppers (Orthoptera: Acrididae: Melanoplinae)
T2  - SYSTEMATIC ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - The Andes, the world's longest mountain chain, harbours great taxonomic and ecological diversity. Despite their young age, the tropical Andes are highly diverse due to recent geological uplift. Speciation either followed the orogeny closely or occurred after the Andean uplift, as a result of subsequent climatic changes. Different scenarios have been proposed to explain the diversification of high Andean taxa. The Melanoplinae grasshopper Ponderacris Ronderos & Cigliano is endemic to the eastern slopes of the Andes of Peru and Bolivia, mostly distributed between 1000 and 4000 m above sea level. Diversification in several montane habitats of Bolivia and Peru allows tests via cladistic analysis of distinct possible geographic modes of speciation. Eight species are recognized, with three described here as new with revised diagnostic morphological characters provided: Ponderacris carlcarbonellisp.n.,P. chulumaniensissp.n. and P. amboroensissp.n. Cladistic analyses of 15 species (8 ingroup and 7 outgroup) and 38 morphological characters, under equal and implied weighting, confirm the monophyly of Ponderacris. Characters from the external morphology and colour pattern provided less phylogenetic information than did the male abdominal terminalia and phallic complex. Species distributed in the Peruvian Andes constituted a monophyletic group, whereas those from the Bolivian Andes formed a basal paraphyletic grade. Dispersalvicariance analysis resulted in one ancestral distribution reconstruction indicating that the most recent common ancestor was distributed in the Lower Montane Yungas of Bolivia. Eleven dispersal and one vicariant events are postulated, with a South-to-North speciation pattern coincident with progressive Andean uplift. Vicariance could relate to fragmentation of montane forest during the dry intervals of the late Cenozoic. From the Bolivian area, ancestral Peruvian Ponderacris may have dispersed northward, coinciding with the rise of the Andes. Ten of 11 dispersal events occurred at terminal taxa and are likely to be recent. However, diversification of Ponderacris cannot be explained solely by the South-to-North speciation hypothesis, but may also include both vicariance and dispersal across barriers influenced by Pleistocene climatic cycles.

TI  - Potential Drift of Pollen of <i>Cycas micronesica</i> on the Island of Guam: A Comparative Study
T2  - HORTSCIENCE
AB  - We have investigated the potential movement on air currents of pollen from Guam's native cycad, Cycas micronesica, proposed as ambophilic. We measured wind velocities and directions in different cycad habitats that vary in their exposure to trade winds, determined pollen settling velocities, and then modeled the potential horizontal pollen drift distance in each habitat. Similar measurements were performed on several entomophilous Zamia cycads and six zoophilous tropical trees used in horticulture or landscaping. All cycad species' pollen exhibited relatively slow mean settling velocities (0.73-1.29 cm.s(-1)) with C. micronesica pollen in the middle of this range. Our models predicted that wind in more open habitats with wind directions east northeast (ENE) to northeast (NE) and velocities >2 m.s(-1) could transport C. micronesica pollen, either single grains or clumps, hundreds of meters downwind from the pollen source before falling 1 or 2 m. In forested habitats and at typical heights of cycad cones in the understory, the mean wind velocities ranged from <0.03 m.s(-1) to m.s(-1). In habitats with mean winds 1:1.2 models predicted pollen transport distances of tens of meters from the pollen source. In sheltered habitats with velocities near 0.03 m.s(-1), the potential wind transport of pollen was limited to less than a few meters, suggesting that wind would be an ineffective vector in such areas. Pollen grains of all angiosperm species were larger except one, and the species with larger grains had settling velocities 3-26 times faster than that of cycad pollens. Even so, winds in most Guam environments could transport pollen of most angiosperm species over 50 m before falling 1 m. In summary, the results suggested that pollen size, clumping tendencies, and drift of most of these species do not preclude a role for wind in moving pollen in habitats exposed to trade winds, and that other physical and plant characteristics affect their pollination mode. For C. micronesica, these pollen and plant attributes do not preclude entomophily, and insects are likely required in the deep understory where cycads are present.

TI  - Endophytes as potential pathogens of the baobab species <i>Adansonia gregorii</i>: a focus on the Botryosphaeriaceae
T2  - FUNGAL ECOLOGY
AB  - Adansonia gregorii (baobab) is an iconic tree species occurring in the north-west of Australia. Dying baobabs, A. digitata, have been reported from southern Africa and as A. gregorii is closely related to A. digitata, surveys were conducted to assess the health of the Australian baobab. The endophytic microflora of A. gregorii and surrounding tree species was sampled and the ability of these endophytes to cause disease in A. gregorii was determined. Endophytes were isolated from asymptomatic baobabs across 24 sites in the Kimberley region, north-west Australia. Material was also taken from surrounding native tree species at three sites. Material was also collected from asymptomatic and dying Adansonia species in the George Brown Darwin Botanic Gardens and from a dying baobab in a nursery in Broome. Endophytic fungi isolated from these samples were identified using morphological and molecular methods. Eleven botryosphaeriaceous species were identified along with 18 other non-botryosphaeriaceous species; Lasiodiplodia theobromae was the most common species. The pathogenicity of the botryosphaeriaceous species to baobabs was determined by inoculating the taproot of seedlings and stems of young baobab trees. Lasiodiplodia theobromae was confirmed as a potentially significant pathogen of baobabs. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd and The British Mycological Society. All rights reserved.

TI  - Asiatic Acid Induces Colon Cancer Cell Growth Inhibition and Apoptosis through Mitochondrial Death Cascade
T2  - BIOLOGICAL & PHARMACEUTICAL BULLETIN
AB  - Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in the world. The triterpenoid compound asiatic acid derived from the tropical medicinal plant Centella asiatica displays cytotoxic activity on fibroblast cells and several other kinds of cells. The present work studies asiatic acid-mediated growth inhibition of cancer cells and the underlying mechanism. Asiatic acid markedly inhibited cancer cell proliferation. Apoptosis of SW480 human colon cancer cells was induced by asiatic acid as shown by flow cytometry, DNA fragmentation and nuclear chromatin condensation experiments. Through increasing mitochondrial membrane permeability and cytochrome c release from mitochondria into cytosol, asiatic acid induced caspase-9 activity, which further activated caspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage resulting in irreversible apoptotic death in the tumor cells. Taken together, these results suggest that mitochondrial death apoptosis cascade plays very important roles in asiatic acid-induced cancer apoptosis.

TI  - Prediction of antischistosomal small molecules using machine learning in the era of big data
T2  - MOLECULAR DIVERSITY
AB  - Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by helminths of the Schistosoma genus. Despite its high morbidity and socio-economic burden, therapeutics are just a handful with praziquantel being the main drug. Praziquantel is an old drug registered for human use in 1982 and has since been administered en masse for chemotherapy, risking the development of resistance, thus the need for new drugs with different mechanisms of action. This review examines the use of machine learning (ML) in this era of big data to aid in the prediction of novel antischistosomal molecules. It first discusses the challenges of drug discovery in schistosomiasis. Explanations are then offered for big data, its characteristics and then, some open databases where large biochemical data on schistosomiasis can be obtained for ML model development are examined. The concepts of artificial intelligence, ML, and deep learning and their drug applications are explored in schistosomiasis. The use of binary classification in predicting antischistosomal compounds and some algorithms that have been applied including random forest and naive Bayesian are discussed. For this review, some deep learning algorithms (deep neural networks) are proposed as novel algorithms for predicting antischistosomal molecules via binary classification. Databases specifically designed for housing bioactivity data on antischistosomal molecules enriched with functional genomic datasets and ontologies are thus urgently needed for developing predictive ML models.

TI  - The Columbian Encounter and the Little Ice Age: Abrupt Land Use Change, Fire, and Greenhouse Forcing
T2  - ANNALS OF THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN GEOGRAPHERS
AB  - Pre-Columbian farmers of the Neotropical lowlands numbered an estimated 25 million by 1492, with at least 80 percent living within forest biomes. It is now well established that significant areas of Neotropical forests were cleared and burned to facilitate agricultural activities before the arrival of Europeans. Paleoecological and archaeological evidence shows that demographic pressure on forest resources-facilitated by anthropogenic burning-increased steadily throughout the Late Holocene, peaking when Europeans arrived in the late fifteenth century. The introduction of Old World diseases led to recurrent epidemics and resulted in an unprecedented population crash throughout the Neotropics. The rapid demographic collapse was mostly complete by 1650, by which time it is estimated that about 95 percent of all indigenous inhabitants of the region had perished. We review fire history records from throughout the Neotropical lowlands and report new high-resolution charcoal records and demographic estimates that together support the idea that the Neotropical lowlands went from being a net source of CO2 to the atmosphere before Columbus to a net carbon sink for several centuries following the Columbian encounter. We argue that the regrowth of Neotropical forests following the Columbian encounter led to terrestrial biospheric carbon sequestration on the order of 2 to 5 Pg C, thereby contributing to the well-documented decrease in atmospheric CO2 recorded in Antarctic ice cores from about 1500 through 1750, a trend previously attributed exclusively to decreases in solar irradiance and an increase in global volcanic activity. We conclude that the post-Columbian carbon sequestration event was a significant forcing mechanism of Little Ice Age cooling.

TI  - Demography, hunting ecology, and pathogen exposure of domestic dogs in the Isoso of Bolivia
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
AB  - Disease is increasingly recognized as a threat to the conservation of wildlife, and in many cases the source of disease outbreaks in wild carnivores is the domestic dog. For disease to spill over from a domestic to a wild population, three conditions must be satisfied: susceptibility of the wild species, presence of the disease agent in the domestic population, and contact between the two populations of interest. We investigated the potential for disease spill over from the domestic dog population to the wild carnivore population in the Isoso of Bolivia, an area of tropical dry forest contiguous with a national park. Using questionnaires and discussions with residents, we gathered data on the demography of dogs in the Isoso, including adult and neonatal mortality, litter size, and hunting frequency. We analyzed a large data set containing self-recorded information on bunting in various communities of the Isoso to determine the extent of dog participation in bunting and the duration of hunting trips. Finally, we took blood samples from dogs in the Isoso for a serosurvey of common canine pathogens. More than 95% of dogs had positive titers to canine distemper virus and canine parvovirus. There was also a high seroprevalence in dogs for other pathogens, a high population turnover of dogs (which may allow diseases to be maintained endemically), and frequent opportunities for contact between domestic and wild carnivores. Based on our results and the susceptibility of wild species previously reported in the literature, domestic dogs represent a disease risk for wildlife in the Bolivian Isoso.

TI  - Reactive Case Detection Strategy for Malaria Control and Elimination: A 12 Year Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis from 25 Malaria-Endemic Countries
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE
AB  - Reactive case detection (RACD) is the screening of household members and neighbors of index cases reported in passive surveillance. This strategy seeks asymptomatic infections and provides treatment to break transmission without testing or treating the entire population. This review discusses and highlights RACD as a recommended strategy for the detection and elimination of asymptomatic malaria as it pertains in different countries. Relevant studies published between January 2010 and September 2022 were identified mainly through PubMed and Google Scholar. Search terms included "malaria and reactive case detection", "contact tracing", "focal screening", "case investigation", "focal screen and treat". MedCalc Software was used for data analysis, and the findings from the pooled studies were analyzed using a fixed-effect model. Summary outcomes were then presented using forest plots and tables. Fifty-four (54) studies were systematically reviewed. Of these studies, 7 met the eligibility criteria based on risk of malaria infection in individuals living with an index case < 5 years old, 13 met the eligibility criteria based on risk of malaria infection in an index case household member compared with a neighbor of an index case, and 29 met the eligibility criteria based on risk of malaria infection in individuals living with index cases, and were included in the meta-analysis. Individuals living in index case households with an average risk of 2.576 (2.540-2.612) were more at risk of malaria infection and showed pooled results of high variation heterogeneity chi-square = 235.600, (p < 0.0001) I-2 = 98.88 [97.87-99.89]. The pooled results showed that neighbors of index cases were 0.352 [0.301-0.412] times more likely to have a malaria infection relative to index case household members, and this result was statistically significant (p < 0.001). The identification and treatment of infectious reservoirs is critical to successful malaria elimination. Evidence to support the clustering of infections in neighborhoods, which necessitates the inclusion of neighboring households as part of the RACD strategy, was presented in this review.

TI  - Influence of soil management for soybean production under microbial diversity in amazon soils
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
AB  - The tropical Amazon has a unique biodiversity that has been affected by the development of pastures and economically important crops, such as soybeans. In the Amazon soil, the communities of microorganisms are diverse and act in different biogeochemical activities relevant to their adaptation to the environment. The assessment of changes in soil microorganism communities is essential to consider the impact of agribusiness action in one of the wealthiest regions in diversity in the world. Thus, the soil microbial diversity of the Amazon forest, the north region of Brazil, was evaluated regarding the influence of soybean farming with regions with periods of two and 14 years of exploitation, with regions of pasture and forest area, through the metagenomics approach with new generation sequencing technology, in addition, it was considered chemical characteristics such as pH value, organic matter content, macronutrients, micronutrients, and cations. High microbial diversity was identified at all collection sites and, despite this, bacterial, archaeal, and virus communities were very diverse between sites, with higher identification of Enterobacter cloacae and species of Pseudomonas, Pseudoplusia includens, Methanosarcina barkeri in the farmed and pasture, whose microbial diversity is influenced by the presence of cations and the interaction of organic matter with clay. It was evident that there is a change in the communities of native microorganisms for others adapted in the areas that had their vegetal cover eliminated.

TI  - An enigma: how can freshwater eels (<i>Anguilla</i> spp.) be such a successful genus yet be universally threatened?
T2  - REVIEWS IN FISH BIOLOGY AND FISHERIES
AB  - Freshwater eels are of tropical marine origin and have spread worldwide. Of the 19 recognised species or subspecies, all 6 temperate species are listed within IUCN Threatened Species categories, together with 7 tropical species. Many reasons have been advanced to explain the significant declines of eels including habitat fragmentation and loss, spread of parasites and diseases, pollution, impacts of hydro dams, overfishing and oceanic changes. The present paper reviews some of the unique life history characteristics of Anguillids-fecundity and semelparous spawning, adaptability, resilience, and being energetically conservative-but despite such remarkable adaptations, according to the IUCN the genus is facing possible extinction. It is suggested that Anguillid life history strategies rely on two additional components-environmental determination of sex, and the need for surplus production (the Surplus Production Hypothesis, SPH). Surplus production is required to counteract the many hazards that eels face throughout an often long and complex life history. Recruitment of temperate species has fallen by over 90%, and resulting lower densities of juvenile eels in tidal and lower river reaches provides less incentive for upstream migration and dispersal. Female eels are generally found further inland than males, with development of sex associated with lower densities. With fewer juveniles migrating to inland areas, the numbers of females will become reduced, and further compound the reduced spawner biomass and consequent reduced recruitment of glass eels. The SPH hypothesis emphasises the importance of conservative harvest of glass eels, habitat connectivity, the need to ensure maximum female escapement, and the importance of stocking inland waterways with juvenile eels.

TI  - Paleoecology and "inter-situ" restoration on Kaua'i, Hawai'i
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Paleoecological studies from tropical islands around the globe show that human. colonization has been devastating for these remote biotic communities. Island histories reveal that human predation and human-mediated landscape change have each played a key role, but many island extinctions following human arrival are strongly associated with introduced predators, herbivores, weeds, and diseases. On the Hawaiian Island of Kaua'i, human-caused extinctions are currently occurring in a microcosm of island endemics. Recent studies of endangered plants suggest that conventional in-situ and ex-situ conservation strategies are losing the battle here. Paleoecological findings support the idea that creating new populations in formerly much larger, late prehistoric and early historical ranges of declining species may provide a reliable and cost-effective hedge against extinction. On Kaua'i, several paleoecological sites have played key roles in planning and implementing ecological and cultural restoration projects.

TI  - Quantifying the spatial dependence of Culicoides midge samples collected by Onderstepoort-type blacklight traps: an experimental approach to infer the range of attraction of light traps
T2  - MEDICAL AND VETERINARY ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - The emergence of bluetongue disease in Europe has led several countries to rapidly establish large-scale entomological surveys of its vectors, which are midges belonging to the genus Culicoides Latreille, 1809 (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae). These surveys have largely been based on the use of Onderstepoort-type blacklight traps. However, the range of attraction of the traps and the spatial dependence of the samples they provide are unknown, which somewhat complicates subsequent analyses. This paper investigates spatial interaction between Onderstepoort-type blacklight traps based on catches at a central trap placed close to two traps set in consecutive on/off modes. The spatial interaction is inferred from the drop in the number of midges collected in the central trap when nearby traps positioned at 50 m, 100 m or 200 m are turned on. The results showed a significant spatial interaction between traps separated by 50 m for female Culicoides obsoletus/Culicoides scoticus and Culicoides dewulfi. No significant interaction was found for female Culicoides of other species, for male Culicoides, or for traps spaced at =100 m. Based on the experimental design geometry and on simple assumptions on the distribution of Culicoides midges in the neighbourhood of the traps, the paper also presents a method to infer the range of attraction of the traps.

TI  - Mithun (Bos frontalis): the neglected cattle species and their significance to ethnic communities in the Eastern Himalaya - A review
T2  - ANIMAL BIOSCIENCE
AB  - Objective: This review consolidates the available information on the socio-economic and ecological significance of Mithun in the lives of ethnic communities in the Eastern Himalaya. Methods: Standard guidelines were followed for the review and data collection was carried out at three stages; literature search, literature screening, and literature review and analysis. Results: Records indicate a long association of Mithun with the ethnic groups. Mithun serves as a symbol of pride and local currency for barter trade in the ethnic society. Its utilities range from being used as a bride price to settling legal disputes. Several cultural festivals and local ceremonies are celebrated around this bovine. Due to its semi-wild nature, this animal also has an ecological role to conserve broad leaf sub-tropical forests. However, remains neglected and has not received policy attention, leading to a stagnated growth. The institutions for Mithun research and development are also weak. Furthermore, the species is under threat from new diseases and habitat alteration triggered by climate change. Conclusion: Founded on the current state of knowledge, there is a need for institutional development, strengthening institutional linkages, and promoting regional cooperation among Mithun rearing countries for further research and development of this unique cattle.

T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Aims To survey and to characterize entomopathogenic fungi as natural enemies of mosquitoes in Central Brazil. Methods and Results Tolypocladium cylindrosporum (Hypocreales, Ophiocordycipitaceae) was isolated for the first time in South America by using Aedes aegypti (Diptera, Culicidae) as sentinel larvae in a stagnant mosquito breeding site in a secondary tropical forest. Two isolates were morphologically and molecularly identified, and their activity tested against A. aegypti eggs, larvae and adults. Conclusions Findings emphasize the importance of T. cylindrosporum as a natural fungal antagonist of mosquitoes. Significance and Impact of the Study Both isolates affected larvae and adults but were less effective against eggs; both have potential for development as a mycoinsecticide especially against larvae of A. aegypti the main vector of dengue, chikungunya, Zika and urban yellow fever.

TI  - Assessing Climate Smart Agriculture and Its Determinants of Practice in Ghana: A Case of the Cocoa Production System
T2  - LAND
AB  - Agriculture in Africa is not only exposed to climate change impacts but is also a source of greenhouse gases (GHGs). While GHG emissions in Africa are relatively minimal in global dimensions, agriculture in the continent constitutes a major source of GHG emissions. In Ghana, agricultural emissions are accelerating, mainly due to ensuing deforestation of which smallholder cocoa farming is largely associated. The sector is also bedevilled by soil degradation, pests, diseases and poor yields coupled with poor agronomic practices. Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA) thus offers a way to reduce the sector's GHG emissions and to adapt the sector to the adverse impacts of climate change. This study assesses the potential of CSA vis-a-vis conventional cocoa systems to enhance production, mitigate and/or remove GHG emissions and build resilience, in addition to understanding key determinants influencing CSA practices. Using a mixed methods approach, data was collected in Ghana's Juabeso and Atwima Mponua districts through semi-structured household questionnaires administered to 80 household heads of cocoa farms, two focus group discussions and expert interviews. A farm budget analysis of productivity and economic performance for both scenarios show that CSA practitioners had a 29% higher income per ha compared to the conventional farmers. Estimations using the FAO Ex-Ante Carbon-Balance Tool (EX-ACT) indicate CSA practices preserve forest resources without which the effect on carbon balance as presented by conventional farming would remain a source of GHG emissions. Farm tenure, age of farmers, location of farm, residential status and access to extension services were the main determining factors influencing CSA practices among cocoa farmers. An in-depth understanding of these indicators can help identify ways to strengthen CSA strategies in the cocoa sector and their contributions to climate change mitigation and resilience.

TI  - Initial pen and field assessment of baits to use in oral rabies vaccination of Formosan ferret-badgers in response to the re-emergence of rabies in Taiwan
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Background & para;& para;Taiwan had been considered rabies free since 1961, until a newly established wildlife disease surveillance program identified rabies virus transmission within the Formosan ferret-badger (Melogale moschata subaurantiaca) in 2013. Ferret-badgers occur throughout southern China and Southeast Asia, but their ecological niche is not well described.& para;& para;Methodology/Principle findings & para;& para;As an initial feasibility assessment for potential rabies control measures, field camera trapping and pen assessment of 6 oral rabies vaccine (ORV) baits were conducted in Taiwan in 2013. 46 camera nights were recorded; 6 Formosan ferret-badgers and 14 non-target mammals were sighted. No baits were consumed by ferret-badgers and 8 were consumed by non-target mammals. Penned ferret-badgers ingested 5 of the 18 offered baits. When pen and field trials were combined, and analyzed for palatability, ferret-badgers consumed 1 of 9 marshmallow baits (11.1%), 1 of 21 fishmeal baits (4.8%), 0 of 3 liver baits, and 3 of 3 fruit-flavored baits. It took an average of 261 minutes before ferret-badgers made oral contact with the non-fruit flavored baits, and 34 minutes for first contact with the fruit-based bait. Overall, ferret-badgers sought out the fruit baits 8 times faster, spent a greater proportion of time eating fruit baits, and were 7.5 times more likely to have ruptured the vaccine container of the fruit-based bait.& para;& para;Conclusions/Significance & para;& para;Ferret-badgers are now recognized as rabies reservoir species in China and Taiwan, through two independent 'dog to ferret-badger' host-shift events. Species of ferret-badgers can be found throughout Indochina, where they may be an unrecognized rabies reservoir. Findings from this initial study underscore the need for further captive and field investigations of fruit-based attractants or baits developed for small meso-carnivores. Non-target mammals' competition for baits, ants, bait design, and dense tropical landscape represent potential challenges to effective ORV programs that will need to be considered in future studies.

TI  - LANTANA, OR RED SAGE (LANTANA-CAMARA L, [VERBENACEAE]), NOTORIOUS WEED AND POPULAR GARDEN FLOWER - SOME CASES OF POISONING IN FLORIDA
T2  - ECONOMIC BOTANY
AB  - Lantana, or red sage (Lantana camara, Verbenaceae) is an aromatic shrub with rough, opposite or whorled leaves and four-angled, prickly or smooth stems, showy heads of small flowers (usually pink-and-yellow changing to red-and-orange) and dark-blue or blackish fruits. Native from tropical America north to lower Texas and southern Georgia, the bird-distributed plant has become naturalized in the Caribbean area, the Pacific islands, Australia New Zealand, South Africa and southern Asia. Hundreds of cultivars are grown as ornamentals in temperate climates. In warm regions, L. camara is a pest in farms, pastures and forests, providing breeding places for diseases, detrimental animals and insects, including the tsetse fly. Of 29 named races in Australia, 19 are toxic or gravely pestiferous. Active principles are the triterpenes lantadene A and B. Ingestion of 340-453 g of leaves causes liver and kidney damage, photosensitization, intestinal hemorrhage, paralysis of the gall bladder, and death in 1-4 days in horses, cattle and sheep (not goats). Ripe fruits are edible, but green, unripe fruits have caused illness and one known fatality in children in Florida. Leaves and roots are popular folk remedies. Stems are used as toothbrushes, and the leaves for polishing wood. Prickly races are grown as protective hedges around forest dwellings.

TI  - Exploring the Biocontrol Efficacy of <i>Trichoderma</i> spp. against <i>Rigidoporus microporus</i>, the Causal Agent of White Root Rot Disease in Rubber Trees (<i>Hevea brasiliensis</i>)
T2  - PLANTS-BASEL
AB  - Rigidoporus microporus, which causes white root rot disease (WRD) in Hevea brasiliensis, is a looming threat to rubber plantation in Malaysia. The current study was conducted to determine and evaluate the efficiency of fungal antagonists (Ascomycota) against R. microporus in rubber trees under laboratory and nursery conditions. A total of 35 fungal isolates established from the rubber tree rhizosphere soil were assessed for their antagonism against R. microporus by the dual culture technique. Trichoderma isolates can inhibit the radial growth of R. microporus by 75% or more in the dual culture test. Strains of T. asperellum, T. koningiopsis, T. spirale, and T. reesei were selected to assess the metabolites involved in their antifungal activity. Results indicated that T. asperellum exhibited an inhibitory effect against R. microporus in both volatile and non-volatile metabolite tests. All Trichoderma isolates were then tested for their ability in producing hydrolytic enzymes such as chitinase, cellulase and glucanase, indole acetic acid (IAA), siderophores production, and phosphate solubilization. From the positive results of the biochemical assays, T. asperellum and T. spirale were selected as the biocontrol candidates to be further tested in vivo against R. microporus. The nursery assessments revealed that rubber tree clone RRIM600 pretreated with only T. asperellum or with the combination of T. asperellum and T. spirale was able to reduce the disease severity index (DSI) and exert higher suppression of R. microporus compared to other pretreated samples, with the average DSI below 30%. Collectively, the present study demonstrates that T. asperellum represents a potential biocontrol agent that should be further explored to control R. microporus infection on rubber trees.

T2  - REVISTA DO INSTITUTO DE MEDICINA TROPICAL DE SAO PAULO
AB  - Haemagogus leucocelaenus, which is considered a major vector of wild yellow fever, exhibits acrodendrophilic habits and mainly deposits its eggs in treeholes and bamboo internodes. The selection of nursery sites is essential in the life history and reproductive success of mosquitoes. The present work investigated the preferred oviposition height and period of Hg. leucocelaenus in an Atlantic forest area in Rio de Janeiro. Sampling was performed using oviposition traps that were placed on plant material at 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 m above the ground, from August 2015 to July 2016. Eggs were more abundant during October and May, and the height of traps placement had no significant effect on the eggs number indicating that Hg. leucocelaenus explores different levels of forest habitats, a behavior that may favor the transmission of pathogens among arboreal animals including primates and humans. The findings of the present study are discussed from an ecological and epidemiological point of view.

TI  - Expression of interferon-inducible chemokines and sleep/wake changes during early encephalitis in experimental African trypanosomiasis
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   Human African trypanosomiasis or sleeping sickness, caused by the parasite Trypanosoma brucei, leads to neuroinflammation and characteristic sleep/wake alterations. The relationship between the onset of these alterations and the development of neuroinflammation is of high translational relevance, but remains unclear. This study investigates the expression of interferon (IFN)-gamma and IFN-inducible chemokine genes in the brain, and the levels of CXCL10 in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid prior to and during the encephalitic stage of trypanosome infection, and correlates these with sleep/wake changes in a rat model of the disease.
   Methodology/Principal findings
   The expression of genes encoding IFN-gamma, CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 was assessed in the brain of rats infected with Trypanosoma brucei brucei and matched controls using semiquantitative end-point RT-PCR. Levels of CXCL10 in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid were determined using ELISA. Sleep/wake states were monitored by telemetric recording. Using immunohistochemistry, parasites were found in the brain parenchyma at 14 days post-infection (dpi), but not at 6 dpi. Ifn-gamma, Cxcl9, Cxcl10 and Cxcl11 mRNA levels showed moderate upregulation by 14 dpi followed by further increase between 14 and 21 dpi. CXCL10 concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid increased between 14 and 21 dpi, preceded by a rise in the serum CXCL10 level between 6 and 14 dpi. Sleep/wake pattern fragmentation was evident at 14 dpi, especially in the phase of wake predominance, with intrusion of sleep episodes into wakefulness. Conclusions/Significance
   The results show a modest increase in Cxcl9 and Cxcl11 transcripts in the brain and the emergence of sleep/wake cycle fragmentation in the initial encephalitic stage, followed by increases in Ifn-gamma and IFN-dependent chemokine transcripts in the brain and of CXCL10 in the cerebrospinal fluid. The latter parameter and sleep/wake alterations could provide combined humoral and functional biomarkers of the early encephalitic stage in African trypanosomiasis.

TI  - Anti-Mayaro virus activity of <i>Cassia australis</i> extracts (Fabaceae, Leguminosae)
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
AB  - Background: The arthropod-borne Mayaro virus (MAYV) causes 'Mayaro fever', a disease of medical significance, primarily affecting individuals in permanent contact with forested areas in tropical South America. Studies showed that the virus could also be transmitted by the mosquito Aedes aegypti. Recently, MAYV has attracted attention due to its likely urbanization. To date, there are no drugs that can treat this illness.
   Methods: Fractions and compounds were obtained by chromatography from leaf extracts of C. australis and chemically identified as flavonoids and condensed tannins using spectroscopic and spectrometric techniques (UV, NMR, and ESI-FT-ICR MS). Cytotoxicity of EtOAc, n-BuOH and EtOAc-Pp fractions were measured by the dye-uptake assay while their antiviral activity was evaluated by a virus yield inhibition assay. Larvicidal activity was measured by the procedures recommended by the WHO expert committee for determining acute toxicity.
   Results: The following group of substances was identified from EtOAc, n-BuOH and EtOAc-Pp fractions: flavones, flavonols, and their glycosides and condensed tannins. EtOAc and n-BuOH fractions inhibited MAYV production, respectively, by more than 70% and 85% at 25 mu g/mL. EtOAc-Pp fraction inhibited MAYV production by more than 90% at 10 mu g/mL, displaying a stronger antiviral effect than the licensed antiviral ribavirin. This fraction had an excellent antiviral effect (IC90 = 4.7 +/- 0.3 mu g/mL), while EtOAc and n-BuOH fractions were less active (IC90 = 89.1 +/- 4.4 mu g/mL and IC90 = 40.9 +/- 5.7 mu g/mL, respectively).
   Conclusions: C. australis can be used as a source of compounds with anti-Mayaro virus activity. This is the first report on the biological activity of C. australis.

TI  - Evidence of Apeu Virus Infection in Wild Monkeys, Brazilian Amazon
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Orthobunyaviruses are arboviruses in which at least 30 members are human pathogens. The members of group C orthobunyaviruses were first isolated in the Brazilian Amazon in 1950, since that time little information is accumulated about ecology and the medical impact of these virus groups in Brazil. Herein, we describe the evidence of Apeu virus (APEUV; an Orthobunyavirus member) infection in wild monkeys from the Brazilian Amazon forest. APEUV was detected by using a neutralizing antibody in serum and its RNA, suggesting past and acute infection of Amazonian monkeys by this virus. These results altogether represent an important contribution of orthobunyavirus ecology in the Amazon and an update about recent circulation and risk for humans with expansion of the cities to Amazon forest.

Although primarily developed for disease resistance and amenability to clonal propagation, they have also proven to have good growth rates and site plasticity. Here we examined the susceptibility of pure Corymbia species and hybrids to pest attack. Three trial sites containing C. citriodora subsp. variegata, C. torelliana, and the hybrids C. torelliana x C. citriodora subsp. variegata, C. torelliana x C. citriodora subsp. citriodora and C. torelliana x C. henryi were assessed for pest identity, incidence and severity. Pests caused about three-quarters of the visible crown damage to trees in these trials. At the site that had the most arthropod damage, hybrid trees had higher damage scores and higher growth scores (height, diameter at breast height over bark, and volume) than pure species. Site was more important than taxon in explaining damage scores, and taxa performed differently for most traits between sites. Tree growth was negatively correlated with general crown damage, while arthropod damage alone showed no significant relationship with growth. Our results highlight the importance of establishing taxa trials across a range of sites when selecting for pest resistance.

TI  - The pathogenicity and virulence of Leishmania-interplay of virulence factors with host defenses
T2  - VIRULENCE
AB  - Leishmaniasis is a group of disease caused by the intracellular protozoan parasite of the genus Leishmania. Infection by different species of Leishmania results in various host immune responses, which usually lead to parasite clearance and may also contribute to pathogenesis and, hence, increasing the complexity of the disease. Interestingly, the parasite tends to reside within the unfriendly environment of the macrophages and has evolved various survival strategies to evade or modulate host immune defense. This can be attributed to the array of virulence factors of the vicious parasite, which target important host functioning and machineries. This review encompasses a holistic overview of leishmanial virulence factors, their role in assisting parasite-mediated evasion of host defense weaponries, and modulating epigenetic landscapes of host immune regulatory genes. Furthermore, the review also discusses the diagnostic potential of various leishmanial virulence factors and the advent of immunomodulators as futuristic antileishmanial drug therapy.

TI  - Study of onchocerciasis-related visual impairment in North Kivu province of the Democratic Republic of Congo in Africa
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF OPHTHALMOLOGY
AB  - Purpose: The Objective of this study is to determine baseline data regarding onchocercal eye lesions and associated visual loss in the Nord Kivu province, an onchocerciasis hyperendemic tropical rain forest area in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in the Nord Kivu province of the DRC during which 2150 subjects were examined ophthalmologically. The eye examination included visual acuity (VA), slit-lamp examination, ophthalmoscopy, intraocular pressure, and visual field assessment by the confrontation test. Patients with suspicion of glaucoma were further evaluated by Humphreys automated perimeter. Results: 39 (1.81%) out of 2150 subjects had onchocerciasis-related eye lesions and 4 (0.19%) were blind (VA <3/60). Chorioretinitis (0.88%) was the most frequent onchocerciasis lesion followed by keratitis (0.46%), microfilaria in the anterior chamber (0.28%), iridocyclitis (0.28%), secondary glaucoma (0.19%), complicated cataract (0.19%), and optic atrophy (0.19%). Visual impairment was discovered in 114 (5.3%) out of 2150 subjects, of whom 39 (0.19%) had blindness and 75 (3.4%) had low vision. Visual impairment was mostly caused by nononchocerciasis-related diseases like cataract (27.2%), retinal diseases (19.3%), glaucoma (15.8%), and iridocyclitis (15.8%) rather than because of onchocerciasis (9.6%) among all causes of visual impairment. Conclusion: Features of ocular onchocerciasis usually described in forest and savanna areas were relatively less common than expected in and around Goma, the capital of the Nord Kivu province of the DRC.

TI  - Mapping the paramo land-cover in the Northern Andes
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
AB  - The Andean paramo is a biodiverse and vulnerable tropical high-mountain region, whose spatio-ecological patterns remain understudied. The lack of general characterization of its overall extent, land-cover classes, and treeline spatial features hinders our capacity to understand its responses to human impacts and predict future land-system changes. To address this knowledge gap, we classified the land-cover of the paramo in the Northern Andes. Moreover, we estimated (1) the paramo's total extent and its distribution among the Andean countries, (2) the relative extent of 12 of its main land-cover classes, categorized into natural vegetation, natural abiotic and anthropogenic groups, and (3) the preliminary position and anthropogenic influence of its bordering treeline. Relying on Landsat 8 imagery, we performed hybrid manual-automated classifications using the Maximum Likelihood and Random Forest algorithms. The two resulting final classifications were manually checked for errors compared to Google Earth and VegParamo data, and used to produce the expert classification. Finally, we delimited the treeline based on regional forest connectivity, and applied it to the expert classification to evaluate paramo elevations, surface areas and land-cover classes above the Andean treeline. The paramo extent was estimated at 24,301 km(2), distributed between Ecuador (47%), Colombia (43%), Venezuela (8%) and Peru (2%). Natural vegetation, especially shrublands, rosette plant communities and grasslands were dominant (altogether, 65%), whereas classes reflecting intense land-use covered 12% overall. The average treeline reached 3546 m and was bordered uphill at 16% with anthropogenic land-cover classes. The paramo's extent is smaller than previously suggested. It remains a (semi-) natural region, yet the expansion of crops and pastures towards high elevations is a critical concern for long-term sustainability. Future research can build on our findings to predict land-system changes and assess priority areas for conservation. We recommend for future research to focus on remnant forest patches and treeline connectivity in priority.

TI  - Preparedness for a Smallpox Pandemic in Japan: Public Health Perspectives
T2  - DISASTER MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH PREPAREDNESS
AB  - Smallpox is an acute, febrile, contagious disease caused by the Variola virus, which is a member of the Poxviridae family. Until the 1970s, smallpox had been a pandemic disease for more than 3000 years, endemic in tropical and developing areas and periodically epidemic worldwide. The World Health Organization declared smallpox to be completely eradicated in 1980 as the result of global vaccination efforts. At that time, all routine vaccination programs were terminated, given the success of this monumental eradication. Although smallpox remains fully eradicated, uncertainty exists regarding the possibility of recurrent smallpox outbreaks. At the end of the Cold War, concerns regarding unstable international security and the feasibility of terrorism with weapons of mass destruction have been highlighted. The potential threat of intentional release of smallpox has forced regional health authorities to reconsider their political landscape and create preparedness plans to protect the community in the event of biological attacks. Here we present current countermeasures to this biological threat in Japan and discuss methods for strengthening public health preparedness both domestically and internationally. These methods include infection control, vaccination policy, and international partnerships to help deter or contain a contagious smallpox pandemic.

TI  - Mapping Mangroves Extents on the Red Sea Coastline in Egypt using Polarimetric SAR and High Resolution Optical Remote Sensing Data
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Mangroves ecosystems dominate the coastal wetlands of tropical and subtropical regions throughout the world. They are among the most productive forest ecosystems. They provide various ecological and economic ecosystem services. Despite of their economic and ecological importance, mangroves experience high yearly loss rates. There is a growing demand for mapping and assessing changes in mangroves extents especially in the context of climate change, land use change, and related threats to coastal ecosystems. The main objective of this study is to develop an approach for mapping of mangroves extents on the Red Sea coastline in Egypt, through the integration of both L-band SAR data of ALOS/PALSAR, and high resolution optical data of RapidEye. This was achieved via using object-based image analysis method, through applying different machine learning algorithms, and evaluating various features such as spectral properties, texture features, and SAR derived parameters for discrimination of mangroves ecosystem classes. Three non-parametric machine learning algorithms were tested for mangroves mapping; random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and classification and regression trees (CART). As an input for the classifiers, we tested various features including vegetation indices (VIs) and texture analysis using the gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM). The object-based analysis method allowed clearly discriminating the different land cover classes within mangroves ecosystem. The highest overall accuracy (92.15%) was achieved by the integrated SAR and optical data. Among all classifiers tested, RF performed better than other classifiers. Using L-band SAR data integrated with high resolution optical data was beneficial for mapping and characterization of mangroves growing in small patches. The maps produced represents an important updated reference suitable for developing a regional action plan for conservation and management of mangroves resources along the Red Sea coastline.

TI  - Infection with chikungunya virus confers heterotypic cross-neutralizing antibodies and memory B-cells against other arthritogenic alphaviruses predominantly through the B domain of the E2 glycoprotein
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Author summaryThe emergence and re-emergence of alphaviruses as important human pathogens raises questions about the durability and breadth of alphavirus immunity following natural infection in humans. In this study, we examine human immune sera from twelve individuals infected (up to 24 years) previously with chikungunya virus and test the sera against a panel of five Old-World arthritogenic alphaviruses and one New-World encephalitic alphavirus. Both homotypic and cross-reactive memory B-cells were identified in subjects out to 24 years post infection. Our results indicate that infection with chikungunya virus results in a robust and durable cross-reactive humoral immune response. Such a response could potentially provide immunity against repeat infection with chikungunya as well as related alphaviruses for years to decades after initial infection. This cross-reactivity might contribute to restricted transmission of closely related alphaviruses and indicates the potential for chikungunya candidate vaccines to elicit broad protection against other alphaviruses in the Semliki Forest complex.
   Infections with Chikungunya virus, a mosquito-borne alphavirus, cause an acute febrile syndrome often followed by chronic arthritis that persists for months to years post infection. Neutralizing antibodies are the primary immune correlate of protection elicited by infection, and the major goal of vaccinations in development. Using convalescent blood samples collected from both endemic and non-endemic human subjects at multiple timepoints following suspected or confirmed chikungunya infection, we identified antibodies with broad neutralizing properties against other alphaviruses within the Semliki Forest complex. Cross-neutralization generally did not extend to the Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis virus (VEEV) complex, although some subjects had low levels of VEEV-neutralizing antibodies. This suggests that broadly neutralizing antibodies elicited following natural infection are largely complex restricted. In addition to serology, we also performed memory B-cell analysis, finding chikungunya-specific memory B-cells in all subjects in this study as remotely as 24 years post-infection. We functionally assessed the ability of memory B-cell derived antibodies to bind to chikungunya virus, and related Mayaro virus, as well as the highly conserved B domain of the E2 glycoprotein thought to contribute to cross-reactivity between related Old-World alphaviruses. To specifically assess the role of the E2 B domain in cross-neutralization, we depleted Mayaro and Chikungunya virus E2 B domain specific antibodies from convalescent sera, finding E2B depletion significantly decreases Mayaro virus specific cross-neutralizing antibody titers with no significant effect on chikungunya virus neutralization, indicating that the E2 B domain is a key target of cross-neutralizing and potentially cross-protective neutralizing antibodies.

TI  - Automated tracking and analysis of ant trajectories shows variation in forager exploration
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Determining how ant colonies optimize foraging while mitigating pathogen and predator risks provides insight into how the ants have achieved ecological success. Ants must respond to changing resource conditions, but exploration comes at a cost of higher potential exposure to threats. Fungal infected cadavers surround the main foraging trails of the carpenter ant Camponotus rufipes, offering a system to study how foragers behave given the persistent occurrence of disease threats. Studies on social insect foraging behavior typically require many hours of human labor due to the high density of individuals. To overcome this, we developed deep learning based computer vision algorithms to track foraging ants, frame-by-frame, from video footage shot under the natural conditions of a tropical forest floor at night. We found that most foragers walk in straight lines overlapping the same areas as other ants, but there is a subset of foragers with greater exploration. Consistency in walking behavior may protect most ants from infection, while foragers that explore unique portions of the trail may be more likely to encounter fungal spores implying a trade-off between resource discovery and risk avoidance.

TI  - The enigma of yellow fever in East Africa
T2  - REVIEWS IN MEDICAL VIROLOGY
AB  - Despite a safe and effective vaccine, there are approximately 200 000 cases, including 30 000 deaths, due to yellow fever virus (YFV) each year, of which 90% are in Africa. The natural history of YFV has been well described, especially in West Africa, but in East Africa yellow fever (YF) remains characterised by unpredictable focal periodicity and a precarious potential for large epidemics. Recent outbreaks of YF in Kenya (1992-1993) and Sudan (2003 and 2005) are important because each of these outbreaks have involved the re-emergence of a YFV genotype (East Africa) that remained undetected for nearly 40 years and was previously unconfirmed in a clinically apparent outbreak. In addition, unlike West Africa and South America, YF has vet to emerge in urban areas of East Africa and be vectored by Aedes (Stegomyia) aegypti. This is a Significant public health concern in a region where the majority of the population remains unvaccinated. This review describes historical findings, highlights a number of disease indicators, and provides clarification regarding the natural history, recent emergence and future risk of YF in East Africa.

TI  - Sympatric speciation of wild emmer wheat driven by ecology and chromosomal rearrangements
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
AB  - In plants, the mechanism for ecological sympatric speciation (SS) is little known. Here, after ruling out the possibility of secondary contact, we show that wild emmer wheat, at the microclimatically divergent microsite of "Evolution Canyon" (EC), Mt. Carmel, Israel, underwent triple SS. Initially, it split following a bottleneck of an ancestral population, and further diversified to three isolated populations driven by disruptive ecological selection. Remarkably, two postzygotically isolated populations (SFS1 and SFS2) sympatrically branched within an area less than 30 m at the tropical hot and dry savannoid south-facing slope (SFS). A series of homozygous chromosomal rearrangements in the SFS1 population caused hybrid sterility with the SFS2 population. We demonstrate that these two populations developed divergent adaptive mechanisms against severe abiotic stresses on the tropical SFS. The SFS2 population evolved very early flowering, while the SFS1 population alternatively evolved a direct tolerance to irradiance by improved ROS scavenging activity that potentially accounts for its evolutionary fate with unstable chromosome status. Moreover, a third prezygotically isolated sympatric population adapted on the abutting temperate, humid, cool, and forested north-facing slope (NFS), separated by 250 m from the SFS wild emmer wheat populations. The NFS population evolved multiple resistant loci to fungal diseases, including powdery mildew and stripe rust. Our study illustrates how plants sympatrically adapt and speciate under disruptive ecological selection of abiotic and biotic stresses.

TI  - Molecular Evidence of Demographic Expansion of the Chagas Disease Vector <i>Triatoma dimidiata</i> (Hemiptera, Reduviidae, Triatominae) in Colombia
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background: Triatoma dimidiata is one of the most significant vectors of Chagas disease in Central America and Colombia, and, as in most species, its pattern of genetic variation within and among populations is strongly affected by its phylogeographic history. A putative origin from Central America has been proposed for Colombian populations, and high genetic differentiation among three biographically different population groups has recently been evidenced. Analyses based on putatively neutral markers provide data from which past events, such as population expansions and colonization, can be inferred. We analyzed the genealogies of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase 4 (ND4) and the cytochrome oxidase subunit 1-mitochondrial genes, as well as partial nuclear ITS-2 DNA sequences obtained across most of the eco-geographical range in Colombia, to assess the population structure and demographic factors that may explain the geographical distribution of T. dimidiata in this country.
   Results: The population structure results support a significant association between genetic divergence and the eco-geographical location of population groups, suggesting that clear signals of demographic expansion can explain the geographical distribution of haplotypes of population groups. Additionally, empirical date estimation of the event suggests that the population's expansion can be placed after the emergence of the Panama Isthmus, and that it was possibly followed by a population fragmentation process, perhaps resulting from local adaptation accomplished by orographic factors such as geographical isolation.
   Conclusion: Inferences about the historical population processes in Colombian T. dimidiata populations are generally in accordance with population expansions that may have been accomplished by two important biotic and orographic events such as the Great American Interchange and the uplift of the eastern range of the Andes mountains in central Colombia.

TI  - Molecular phylogeny of <i>Rigidoporus microporus</i> isolates associated with white rot disease of rubber trees (<i>Hevea brasiliensis</i>)
T2  - FUNGAL BIOLOGY
AB  - Rigidoporus microporus (Polyporales, Basidiomycota) syn. Rigidoporus lignosus is the most destructive root pathogen of rubber plantations distributed in tropical and sub-tropical regions. Our primary objective was to characterize Nigerian isolates from rubber tree and compare them with other West African, Southeast Asian and American isolates. To characterize the 20 isolates from Nigeria, we used sequence data of the nuclear ribosomal DNA ITS and LSU, beta-tubulin and translation elongation factor 1-alpha (tef1) gene sequences. Altogether, 40 isolates of R. microporus were included in the analyses. Isolates from Africa, Asia and South/Central America formed three distinctive clades corresponding to at least three species. No phylogeographic pattern was detected among R. microporus collected from West and Central African rubber plantations suggesting continuous gene flow among these populations. Our molecular phylogenetic analysis suggests the presence of two distinctive species associated with the white rot disease. Phylogenetic analyses placed R. microporus in the Hymenochaetales in the vicinity of Oxyporus. This is the first study to characterize R. microporus isolates from Nigeria through molecular phylogenetic techniques, and also the first to compare isolates from rubber plantations in Africa and Asia.

TI  - Rodent abundance, diversity and community structure in a bubonic plague endemic area, northern Tanzania
T2  - MAMMALIA
AB  - Rodent-borne diseases such as bubonic plague remain a significant threat to public health in tropical countries. In plague-endemic areas, little information exists on the factors triggering periodic bursts, thus rendering preparedness strategies for preventing the negative impacts of the deadly zoonosis difficult. In this study, we assessed how species richness, diversity, and community structure of rodents are associated with plague persistence in Mbulu District, Tanzania. Rodent data were collected using the removal trapping technique. We captured 610 rodents belonging to 12 species, with Mastomys natalensis recording highest abundance. There was significantly higher abundance and species richness in persistent than non-persistent plague locality. Also, house premises recorded significantly lower species richness than farm and forest habitats. Additionally, we found three broad rodent community structures that varied significantly between studied habitat types suggesting high rodent populations interaction at fine-scale resource abundance. The high abundance and diversity of plague-susceptible rodent reservoirs suggestively contribute to the plague persistence in the foci. These results may be useful to developing preparedness strategies in these areas to control plague outbreaks.

TI  - Liver Transplantation for Acute Liver Failure due to Yellow Fever: A Case Report
T2  - TRANSPLANTATION PROCEEDINGS
CP  - 17th Luso-Brazilian Congress of Transplantation / 14th Portugese Congress of Transplantation
AB  - Yellow fever is a noncontagious disease caused by an arbovirus in the Flaviviridae family. It is an endemic disease in the tropical forests of Africa and South America, with the mosquito as a vector. Approximately half of those infected will be asymptomatic, while 15% will develop the severe/malignant form of the disease that includes renal and hepatic failure, bleeding, and neurological impairment as the principal symptoms. The lethality of the severe form reaches up to 70%. The objective of this study was to report on the case of a patient who was transferred to the hepatobiliary unit of our service due to acute liver failure due to yellow fever. He was treated with liver transplantation. The patient progressed satisfactorily, being discharged from the intensive care unit in 10 days and discharged from the hospital within 19 days after transplantation. Despite the encouraging result of our team, this has not been applied to other centers that have also performed this modality of treatment; therefore, the question remains as to whether and when to recommend liver transplantation for treatment of severe yellow fever.

TI  - Life-history strategies of plant pathogens:: Distribution patterns and phylogenetic analysis
T2  - ECOLOGY
AB  - Here we analyze herbarium records, surveys, and studies of fungal plant pathogens in tropical natural systems in order to establish a framework to study plant pathogen interactions from a life-history perspective. We looked at how life-history traits of pathogens and their host plants affect the distribution of pathogens in different tropical habitats, and the importance of host phylogeny in determining the habitat associations of obligate fungal pathogens. Our study reveals that plant-pathogen interactions are prevalent and widespread in the tropics. Phylogenetic analysis of the distribution of obligate pathogens among plant families did not suggest a strong overall pattern of higher-level host phylogeny in pathogen host range, except that smut pathogens are particularly dominant on Poaceae and Asteraceae, and rusts are most common on Fabaceae, families that dominate disturbed areas in the tropics.

TI  - Estimation of soybean grain yield from multispectral high-resolution UAV data with machine learning models in West Africa
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) is a leguminous and oil crop with rapidly growing importance and demand in Africa following the increasing demand for oil and livestock and poultry feed in sub-Saharan Africa. However, soybean productivity is low in most countries of sub-Saharan Af-rica, especially in West Africa, where productivity is below one ton per ha. Hence, concerted soybean varietal development and testing efforts have been underway by the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA), collaborating with the various African and US-based soybean breeding programs. Integrating new varietal evaluation approaches based on advanced phenotyping techniques into IITA's soybean breeding program is crucial for designing efficient crop genetic improvement techniques. Hence, this work aims to investigate machine learning (ML) models and Unmanned Aerial vehicles (UAVs) to aid rapid high throughput phenotypic workflow for soybean yield estimation. We acquired multispectral images through a Sequoia (R) camera aboard a senseFly eBee X UAV from five variety trials during the 2020 growing season in Nigeria. UAV-based spectral bands, canopy height, vegetation indices (VI), and texture features were generated by gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) and integrated to predict crop grain yield using five machine learning (ML) regression models, including Cubist, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Stochastic Gradient Boosting (GBM), Support vector machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF). The main findings are the textural information generated using gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) slightly outperformed predictors based mainly on vegetation indices (VI) and provided a promising alternative to the conventional use of VI in crop yield estimation. All the five ML models performed moderately well in predicting grain yield for all the soybean trials investigated, though the Cubist and RF model stood out, with R2 reaching 0.89. The study provides a framework to perform crop breeding trial assessments more effectively and consistently at high spatial scales that African crop breeding programs did not commonly apply. The workflow can also be successfully modified and applied for high throughput phenotyping of breeding platforms in other crops.

TI  - Mapping suitability for Buruli ulcer at fine spatial scales across Africa: A modelling study
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Author summary
   Like many neglected tropical diseases primarily affecting the rural poor, Buruli ulcer (BU) is under-detected and under-reported within routine health information systems. As such, the burden and distribution are not fully known, impeding appropriate targeting of health resources, control, and care for people affected. Having previously evaluated and mapped the existing evidence for BU and its causative agent M. ulcerans, we concluded that the disease was likely to occur beyond the range of known endemic areas. However, we were left with the question of where exactly these undetected cases might be occurring. Answering this question required a more fine-scale approach: BU is highly focal, presumably due to local variation in the environmental factors which determine suitability for M. ulcerans survival and transmission to humans. We used the compiled evidence and geographical datasets to build statistical models representing the relationship between environmental factors and previously reported cases. This allowed us to define the ecological niche of BU, and subsequently to identify areas across Africa where this niche was met, providing suitable conditions for the disease. We constructed separate models of suitability for M. ulcerans, using locations where its DNA had been detected in environmental sources. Unsurprisingly, suitability for M. ulcerans was predicted to be wider than, but geographically overlapping with that for BU. This implies that beyond the conditions necessary for survival of the bacterium, additional factors are required for transmission to humans. The high-resolution suitability maps we present are intended to guide case search activities which may identify endemic areas beyond the known endemic range. Data on the true prevalence of BU from targeted case searches within predicted-suitable areas will also allow us to validate and refine the models, and potentially to predict the probability of cases occurring within predicted suitable areas.
   Buruli ulcer (BU) is a disabling and stigmatising neglected tropical disease (NTD). Its distribution and burden are unknown because of underdiagnosis and underreporting. It is caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans, an environmental pathogen whose environmental niche and transmission routes are not fully understood. The main control strategy is active surveillance to promote early treatment and thus limit morbidity, but these activities are mostly restricted to well-known endemic areas. A better understanding of environmental suitability for the bacterium and disease could inform targeted surveillance, and advance understanding of the ecology and burden of BU. We used previously compiled point-level datasets of BU and M. ulcerans occurrence, evidence for BU occurrence within national and sub-national areas, and a suite of relevant environmental covariates in a distribution modelling framework. We fitted relationships between BU and M. ulcerans occurrence and environmental predictors by applying regression and machine learning based algorithms, combined in an ensemble model to characterise the optimal ecological niche for the disease and bacterium across Africa at a resolution of 5km x 5km. Proximity to waterbodies was the strongest predictor of suitability for BU, followed potential evapotranspiration. The strongest predictors of suitability for M. ulcerans were deforestation and potential evapotranspiration. We identified patchy foci of suitability throughout West and Central Africa, including areas with no previous evidence of the disease. Predicted suitability for M. ulcerans was wider but overlapping with that of BU. The estimated population living in areas predicted suitable for the bacterium and disease was 46.1 million.
   These maps could be used to inform burden estimations and case searches which would generate a more complete understanding of the spatial distribution of BU in Africa, and may guide control programmes to identify cases beyond the well-known endemic areas.

TI  - <i>Aedeomyia squamipennis</i> (Diptera: Culicidae) in Florida, USA, a New State and Country Record
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - Aedeomyia squamipennis (Lynch Arribalzaga) is a tropical mosquito (Diptera: Culicidae) found throughout most of the American Tropics, from eastern Mexico through Argentina, including several Caribbean islands. Larvae are typically associated with bodies of water with dense growths of aquatic vegetation, particularly Pistia stratiotes L., water lettuce. Adult females feed predominantly on the blood of birds and seek hosts in forest canopies. Aedeomyia squamipennis is considered an important vector of Gamboa virus and avian malaria, and is also suspected of transmitting Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus. Collections from Florida City, FL, near the southern tip of the Florida peninsula, yielded larvae, adult males, and females of Ad. squamipennis, constituting a new genus and species record for Florida and the United States. The widespread availability of larval habitat and suitable hosts in Florida will likely lead to expansion of Ad. squamipennis in Florida, and perhaps into neighboring states. In South America, Ad. squamipennis is found as far south as Buenos Aires, Argentina, at similar to 35 degrees S latitude, which is equivalent in N latitude to coastal North Carolina. The northern limit of expansion of Ad. squamipennis in North America will likely be limited by winter temperatures and availability of larval habitat.

TI  - Urbanization and Water Containers Influence the Mosquito Community with Consequences for <i>Aedes aegypti</i>
T2  - NEOTROPICAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - We aimed to determine how the degree of urbanization in a Neotropical city influences Aedes aegypti (L.), a pantropical vector of urban yellow fever, dengue, Zika and Chikungunia, via other mosquito species, whether they are competitors or predators, native to the area or invasive. We conducted experiments twice a month during one year in the city of Kourou, French Guiana, on three sites characterized by increasing percentages of imperviousness (i.e., 0.65%, 33.80% and 86.60%). These sites were located in a approximate to 5 ha forest fragment, a residential area with gardens, and in the older part of the city, respectively, and correspond to slightly, moderately and highly urbanized sites. There, we monitored twice a month during one year a total of 108 mosquito communities inhabiting four types of containers (i.e., a tank bromeliad, dry stumps of bamboo, ovitraps and car tires) installed in a random block design. In the tanks of the bromeliad, likely due to the acidity of the water, the immatures of native mosquito species prevailed, particularly Wyeomyia pertinans (Williston) in the slightly urbanized site. The general pattern was very similar in the three other types of containers where Limatus durhamii Theobald dominated in the slightly urbanized site, so that the abundance of Ae. aegypti immatures was low compared to those of native species. Yet, Ae. aegypti strongly dominated in the two more urbanized sites. These findings open up perspectives for vector management, including the conservation and/or the augmentation of natural enemies through modifications to landscape features.

TI  - Pyranocoumarins from tropical species of the genus <i>Calophyllum</i>:: A chemotaxonomic study of extracts in the National Cancer Institute collection
T2  - JOURNAL OF NATURAL PRODUCTS
AB  - (+)-Calanolide A, a novel dipyranocoumarin from the Malesian tree Calophyllum lanigerum var. austrocoriaceum, and a closely related compound, (-)-calanolide B, isolated from Calophyllum teysmannii var. inophylloide, are representatives of a distinct class of nonnucleoside HIV-1 specific reverse-transcriptase inhibitor under development as an AIDS chemotherapeutic. NCI repository specimens totalling 315 organic extracts from 31 taxa of Calophyllum were analyzed for related pyranocoumarins using a simple TLC system. A total of 127 extracts was initially classified as "positive"; eight out of the 31 taxa examined, representing perhaps 28 species already described (1/7-1/8 of all the species in this genus), contained prenylated coumarins, suggesting that these compounds, while sometimes abundantly present, are not widespread in the genus. Representative members of the TLC-positive extracts were partitioned between CH2Cl2 and 25% aqueous MeOH; the CH2Cl2-soluble materials were then analyzed by TLC and H-1 NMR to confirm the presence of pyranocoumarins. The anti-HIV activity of the partitioned extracts are also presented. This study suggested that there are several distinctive coumarin chemotaxonomic markers distinguishing species of this genus.

TI  - Neotropical primary bat cell lines show restricted dengue virus replication
T2  - COMPARATIVE IMMUNOLOGY MICROBIOLOGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB  - Dengue is the most widespread arboviral disease affecting humans. Bats are recognized carriers of emerging viral zoonoses and have been proposed as dengue reservoirs, since RNA/NS1 and/or antiviral antibodies have been detected. Yet, experimental inoculation of Artibeus bats failed to show virus replication. This conflicting results prevent drawing further conclusions of whether bats sustain dengue infection. To test bat cellular permissivity to dengue infection, we established primary bat embryonic cells from diverse organs and tissues of Artibeus jamaicensis, Molossus sinaloae, and Desmodus rotundus. We observed a limited serotype-, organ-, and bat species-specific dengue susceptibility. Only some Molossusderived primary cells sustained poorly initial Dengue serotype-1 replication, though it was latter absent. To elucidate if Molossus bats may play a role in dengue replication, ecological or in vivo experiments must be performed. Taken together our results show that Dengue did not replicate efficiently in cell lines derived from Neotropical bat species. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Landsat 8Bands' 1 to 7 spectral vectors plus machine learning to improve land use/cover classification using Google Earth Engine
T2  - ANNALS OF GIS
AB  - This paper explores a spectral vector-based methodology on Landsat 8 bands of the visible wavelengths, that is deep-blue (1) to shortwave infrared (7), to improve the urban land features classification. Using two different ratio models, based on two and three bands' combinations in the cloud environment of Google Earth Engine, the Uncertainty reducing Spectral Vector (USVr), the Onward Continuous Spectral Vector (OSVc) and the Onward Discontinuous Spectral Vector (OSVd) are proposed as new entries for the land use land cover (LULC) classification. Two different sizes of arrays are built, i.e. 42 vectors and 15 vectors corresponding to the same number of derivative bands and new pixels ' values. A decision tree is built in J.48 and applied to select the most suitable derivative bands for the analysis. Hereafter, the selected ones are stacked and submitted to five machine learning classifiers using a supervised process, namely, Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Random Forest (RF) Gradient Boosting (GBR), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Minimum Distance (MD). This method was tested in the two cities of Bamenda and Foumban in west-Cameroon highlands, due to their good representativeness of tropical hilly urban areas' spatial heterogeneity. The results are satisfying for 4/5 classifiers, up to 87% Overall Accuracy, OA, for 0.82 kappa coefficient, KC, in Bamenda, while combining SVM/OSVd. Whereas, in Foumban, the classifiers perform up to 85%OA and 0.78 KC for the combination SVM/USVr. Only the MD classifier has always performed below 80%OA. The process has been found better than performing classifiers directly on the multispectral (MS) image, by providing more possibilities of hidden spectral indices not yet explored, as far as we know, to detect and discriminate between LULC features, plus an accurate extraction of human settlements.

TI  - High Mobility and Low Use of Malaria Preventive Measures among the Jarai Male Youth along the Cambodia-Vietnam Border
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Malaria control along the Vietnam Cambodia border presents a challenge for both countries' malaria elimination targets as the region is forested, inhabited by ethnic minority populations, and potentially characterized by early and outdoor malaria transmission. A mixed methods study assessed the vulnerability to malaria among the Jarai population living on both sides of the border in the provinces of Ratanakiri (Cambodia) and Gia Lai (Vietnam). A qualitative study generated preliminary hypotheses that were quantified in two surveys, one targeting youth (N = 498) and the other household leaders (N = 449). Jarai male youth, especially in Cambodia, had lower uptake of preventive measures (57.4%) and more often stayed overnight in the deep forest (35.8%) compared with the female youth and the adult population. Among male youth, a high-risk subgroup was identified that regularly slept at friends' homes or outdoors, who had fewer bed nets (32.5%) that were torn more often (77.8%). The vulnerability of Jarai youth to malaria could be attributed to the transitional character of youth itself, implying less fixed sleeping arrangements in nonpermanent spaces or non-bed sites. Additional tools such as long-lasting hammock nets could be suitable as they are in line with current practices.

TI  - Kinetic analysis of inhibition of human immunodeficiency virus type-1 reverse transcriptase by calanolide A
T2  - JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS
AB  - Calanolide A, first isolated from the tropical rain forest tree Calophyllum lanigerum, is a potent human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) specific reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitor, broadly active against diverse HIV-1 strains, including nucleoside and nonnucleoside-resistant variants. We examined the biochemical mechanism of inhibition of HIV-1 RT by calanolide A. Two template/primer systems were examined: ribosomal RNA and homopolymeric rA-dT(12-18). Galanolide A inhibited HIV-1 RT by a complex mechanism involving two calanolide A binding sites. With respect to either deoxynucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) or template/primer binding, one site was competitive and the other was uncompetitive. The data indicated that calanolide A bound near the active site of the enzyme and interfered with dNTP binding. Calanolide A inhibited HIV-1 RT in a synergistic fashion with nevirapine, further distinguishing it from the general class of nonnucleoside RT inhibitors. At certain concentrations, calanolide A bound HIV-1 RT in a mutually exclusive fashion with respect to both the pyrophosphate analog, phosphonoformic acid and the acyclic nucleoside analog 1-ethoxymethyl-5-ethyl-6-phenylthio-2-thiouracil. This indicates that calanolide A shares some binding domains with both phosphonoformic acid and 1-ethoxymethyl-5-ethyl-6-phenylthio-2-thiouracil, presumably reflecting that it interacts with RT near both the pyrophosphate binding site and the active site of the enzyme.

TI  - Shaded coffee and the stability of rainforest margins in northern Latin America
T2  - STABILITY OF TROPICAL RAINFOREST MARGINS: LINKING ECOLOGICAL, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL CONSTRAINTS OF LAND USE AND CONSERVATION
CP  - International Symposium on Stability of Tropical Rainforest Margins
AB  - Most native forests in Latin America are highly fragmented. In the mid elevation areas of Northern Latin America, the agricultural matrix is frequently composed of coffee. In this region, coffee has been traditionally cultivated under the diverse canopy of shade trees, representing a high quality matrix that can contribute to the social and ecological stability of the region. This agroforestry system has been proven to be important for biodiversity conservation. Studies over the last fifteen years have shown that shaded coffee plantations maintain a high diversity of vertebrates, invertebrates and plants. These organisms play an important role in the functioning of coffee agroecosystems. Shaded coffee plantations promote a high abundance and diversity of natural enemies that help to regulate herbivores, weeds and diseases. Shaded plantations also harbor a higher diversity of native pollinators which have been shown to contribute to higher coffee yields. Likewise, the diverse shade-tree component contributes to soil fertility and soil conservation and has been shown to contribute significantly to carbon sequestration. As a matrix, coffee agroforests also contribute to the conservation of biodiversity within forest fragments by promoting migration among fragments and facilitating a metapopulation structure. Three "sustainable" coffee certification programs have been developed to help farmers cope with the vagaries of the market: organic, fair-trade and biodiversity-friendly (or shade-grown). Although certified coffees still represent a small niche market, they have the potential to promote conservation and benefit the livelihoods of small producers. Especially under conditions of low international coffee prices, as those experienced in the first years of this century, these certification programs have contributed to the ecological and socio-economic stability of the coffee growing regions of northern Latin America.

TI  - Vector competence of Aedes aegypti for different strains of Zika virus in Argentina
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - The importance of Zika virus (ZIKV) has increased noticeably since the outbreak in the Americas in 2015, when the illness was associated with congenital disorders. Although there is evidence of sexual transmission of the virus, the mosquito Aedes aegypti is believed to be the main vector for transmission to humans. This species of mosquito has not only been found naturally infected with ZIKV, but also has been the subject of study in many vector competence assays that employ different strains of ZIKV around the world. In Argentina, the first case was reported in February 2016 and a total of 278 autochthonous cases have since been confirmed, however, ZIKV virus has not been isolated from any mosquito species yet in Argentina. In order to elucidate if Argentinian Ae. aegypti populations could be a possible vector of ZIKV, we conducted vector competence studies that involved a local strain of ZIKV from Chaco province, and a Venezuelan strain obtained from an imported case. For this purpose, Ae. aegypti adults from the temperate area of Argentina (Buenos Aires province) were fed with infected blood. Body, legs and saliva were harvested and tested by plaque titration on plates of Vero cells for ZIKV at 7, 11 and 14 days post infection (DPI) in order to calculate infection, transmission, and dissemination rates, respectively. Both strains were able to infect mosquitoes at all DPIs, whereas dissemination and transmission were observed at all DPIs for the Argentinian strain but only at 14 DPI for the Venezuelan strain. This study proves the ability of Ae. aegypti mosquitoes from Argentina to become infected with two different strains of ZIKV, both belonging to the Asian lineage, and that the virus can disseminate to the legs and salivary glands.
   Author summary Zika virus is a flavivirus transmitted by mosquitoes, isolated for the first time in the Ziika Forest in Uganda in 1947 from a rhesus macaque monkey. The disease is usually asymptomatic, but sometimes it causes a mild illness that comes with fever, rash, joint pain, and conjunctivitis. The World Health Organization focused the attention on this virus after the outbreak in the Americas, when the virus was linked to microcephaly and serious neurological diseases, including Guillain-Barre syndrome. Aedes aegypti was incriminated as the main vector of the virus as it was found both naturally and experimentally infected. This mosquito species was declared eradicated in Argentina by 1970 but re-emerged in 1989. Recent studies found a peculiarity in the genetics of Argentinian Ae. aegypti populations that consists in a combination between both subspecies: Ae. aegypti formosus and Ae. aegypti aegypti. Our study tries to elucidate if Ae. aegypti from Argentina are able to transmit the virus in order to add these mosquitoes to the list of possible vectors of ZIKV and, in future prospect, orient to fight the virus by controlling the vector.

TI  - Diversity of <i>Anopheles</i> spp. (Diptera: Culicidae) in an Amazonian Urban Area
T2  - NEOTROPICAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - The genus Anopheles encompasses several species considered as vectors of human infecting Plasmodium. Environmental changes are responsible for behavior changes in these vectors and therefore the pattern of malaria transmission. To better understand the dynamics of malaria transmission, this study aimed at identify the species of adult anophelines found in a malaria endemic urban area of the Amazon region, MA cent ncio Lima, located in the Acre State Brazil. Using Shannon-type light traps installed at 11 collection points near fish ponds, a total of 116 anophelines were collected belonging to nine species. Anopheles darlingi Root 1926 and An. albitarsis s.l. Lynch-Arribalzaga 1878 were the most abundant and predominant species. Despite the low number of captured adult anophelines, the occurrence of An. darlingi throughout all urban area and the presence of secondary vectors reinforce the need of a permanent and continuous entomological surveillance.

TI  - Impact of four years of large-scale ivermectin treatment with low therapeutic coverage on the transmission of <i>Onchocerca volvulus</i> in the Mbam valley focus, central Cameroon
T2  - TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - The extent to which ivermectin treatments have an impact on onchocerciasis transmission is a matter of some concern. We investigated this issue in the Mbam valley, a hyperendemic focus located in a forest-savannah mosaic area of Cameroon. Parasitological examinations of 5-9-year-old children, who had never received any antifilarial drug, were conducted before the first distribution of ivermectin in 1991-1993 and again in 2002, after four annual rounds of mass treatments. After matching for gender, age and village of residence, the prevalence and intensity of microfilaridermia corresponded respectively, in 2002, to 66.2 and 42.0% of the initial values. The decrease was more marked among the youngest children who, compared with the older ones, were submitted to the reduced force-of-infection earlier in their life. The results of the present study suggest that the specific vectorial competence of Simulium squamosum cytotype B, the vector of Onchocerca volvulus in the Mbam valley, allows a significant decrease in onchocerciasis transmission after several years of treatment, despite low therapeutic coverage. Though these results are encouraging, efforts should be made to improve the therapeutic coverage in the area. (C) 2004 Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Spatial genetic structure of <i>Aedes aegypti</i> mosquitoes in mainland Southeast Asia
T2  - EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS
AB  - Aedes aegypti mosquitoes originated in Africa and are thought to have spread recently to Southeast Asia, where they are the major vector of dengue. Thirteen microsatellite loci were used to determine the genetic population structure of A. aegypti at a hierarchy of spatial scales encompassing 36 sites in Myanmar, Cambodia and Thailand, and two sites in Sri Lanka and Nigeria. Low, but significant, genetic structuring was found at all spatial scales (from 5 to > 2000 km) and significant F-IS values indicated genetic structuring even within 500 m. Spatially dependent genetic-clustering methods revealed that although spatial distance plays a role in shaping larger-scale population structure, it is not the only factor. Genetic heterogeneity in major port cities and genetic similarity of distant locations connected by major roads, suggest that human transportation routes have resulted in passive long-distance migration of A. aegypti. The restricted dispersal on a small spatial scale will make localized control efforts and sterile insect technology effective for dengue control. Conversely, preventing the establishment of insecticide resistance genes or spreading refractory genes in a genetic modification strategy would be challenging. These effects on vector control will depend on the relative strength of the opposing effects of passive dispersal.

TI  - Main aspects of the pollution in Brazilian rivers by pesticides
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ENGENHARIA AGRICOLA E AMBIENTAL
AB  - Pesticides, which are used in agriculture for pest and disease control, has caused contamination of water resources. The consequences are changes in ecosystems and damage to health, especially when the waters are used for human consumption. The contamination occurs mainly in areas near the application site by surface runoff or groundwater contamination. Some factors affecting transport to the aquatic environment are the properties of the chemical and environmental conditions, such as soil type, slope, land cover and climate. Some factors such as plateau relief and quartzose soil are present in the most part of the country, causing the water pollution more severe. The adoption of more rational agricultural practices by farmers and measures for protection of riparian forests can prevent pesticide contamination of water resources, which consists in the most efficient control practice for agricultural pollution in the tropical regions.

TI  - Assessing the nature of potential groundwater zones through machine learning (ML) algorithm in tropical plateau region, West Bengal, India
T2  - ACTA GEOPHYSICA
AB  - Groundwater recharge is essential for managing surface and subsoil water resources. Not only for supplying people with daily drinking water, groundwater use for agricultural land and people's livelihood is also continuously increasing. As a result, there has been a decline in groundwater supply in various parts of the world, and it is highly desirable to identify the potential groundwater zones for specific sustainable development. This study aims to use an easy-to-use tool package named Landslide Sustainability Mapping Tool pack (LSM tool Pack) for preparing potential groundwater zone based on R and ArcGIS software integration. This tool uses five modules for processing. Among them, the Feature selection (FS) module brings a novel approach, determining the best subset feature for demarcating the groundwater potential zone. As a result, this best factor subset is used as an input of this tool pack. Additionally, PE modules evaluate the performance of proposed models in statistical performance metrics. In addition, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was obtained with the integration of Performance Evaluation (PE) modules and ARC maps, which helps visual interpretation in evaluating models. This study uses the LSM tool Pack in the Rupnarayan river basin to map the potential groundwater zone based on fourteen controlling factors selected through the FS module, which will further help the local government to make a substitute policy.

TI  - New insights into the identity and origin of the causal agent of oak powdery mildew in Europe
T2  - FOREST PATHOLOGY
AB  - Powdery mildew is the most common disease oil oaks in Europe where it was first recorded at the beginning of the 20th century. Yet, little is known about the origin Of the causal agent. In this study we analysed the variability of the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) of the pathogen. The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, the 5.8S rRNA coding gene and the intergenic spacer (IGS) of the rDNA of 33 European (mostly French) samples of oak powdery mildew were amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and PCR products were subsequently sequenced. Four different haplotypes were obtained for ITS among the various samples (ITSA, ITSB, ITSC and ITSD). Each ITS sequence corresponded to a different IGS sequence. The comparison of ITS sequences obtained with sequences accessible in the GenBank database revealed very high homologies with different taxa. Of these, three taxa had already been described on oaks in Europe, i.e. Erysiphe alphitoides (100% homology with ITSA), Erysiphe hypophylla (99.4% homology with ITSC) and Phyllactinia guttata (97.64% homology with ITSD). Our data also confirmed the 100% homology between ITSA and the sequence described for Oidium mangiferae, the agent of mango powdery mildew. The fourth haplotype, i.e. ITSB, represented by nearly 25% samples, showed 100% homology with the recently described Erysiphe quercicola from Quercus spp. in Asia, and several tropical all sub-tropical powdery mildew species, including Oidium heveae, a major pathogen of rubber trees worldwide. Our results Suggest that oak powdery mildew might originate from host shifts of tropical Erysiphe species introduced to Europe through infected exotic host plants.

TI  - Multiscale environmental determinants of <i>Leishmania</i> vectors in the urban-rural context
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
AB  - Background: In South America, cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) and visceral leishmaniasis (VL) are emerging diseases, expanding in the border area of Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay. Outbreaks of CL were reported since the 1990s, withNyssomyia whitmanias the main vector in this region. Regarding VL, urban reports started in 2010 withLutzomyia longipalpisas the main vector. The aim of this study was to evaluate environmental determinants related to the main vectors of leishmaniasis, to contribute to the prevention and control response to the emergence of VL and CL in the Argentina-Brazil-Paraguay border region.
   Methods: The cross-sectional survey includes two cities and two close rural areas in the Argentinean Northeast Region, between November 2014 and January 2015, with a total of 95 sampling sites. REDILA-BL traps were set for three consecutive nights, and a total of 68 meso- and microscale environmental and landscape characteristics were surveyed. The association between vector abundance with different variables was evaluated using a generalized linear model with zero-inflated negative binomial distribution. We analyzed females for detection of Leishmania DNA.
   Results: The analysis forLu. longipalpisindicates an excess of absences when the mean NDWI around the sites were higher. The abundance ofLu. longipalpisat mesoscale level was higher when more urban services were present, and when blood sources such as chickens or dogs at the microscale level were present. ForNy. whitmani, no variable was found to be associated with the absences, while its abundance increased in association with the following variables: percentage of tree cover, presence of garbage collection service, hosted people and, at microscale, the presence of poultry. Leshmania infantum DNA was detected in 2/49 (4%)Lu. longipalpis.
   Conclusions: The abundance of both species is influenced by variables at different scales, their influence probably has a hierarchy and they are acting on different aspects of the biology of these vectors. The urban spatial segregation ofLu. longipalpisand the peri-urban and rural segregation ofN. whitmaniincrease the risk of VL and CL. The selection of the better variables for each scale will allow the design of appropriate control strategies depending on species.

TI  - RNA-Seq analysis of chikungunya virus infection and identification of granzyme A as a major promoter of arthritic inflammation
T2  - PLOS PATHOGENS
AB  - Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an arthritogenic alphavirus causing epidemics of acute and chronic arthritic disease. Herein we describe a comprehensive RNA-Seq analysis of feet and lymph nodes at peak viraemia (day 2 post infection), acute arthritis (day 7) and chronic disease (day 30) in the CHIKV adult wild-type mouse model. Genes previously shown to be up-regulated in CHIKV patients were also up-regulated in the mouse model. CHIKV sequence information was also obtained with up to approximate to 8% of the reads mapping to the viral genome; however, no adaptive viral genome changes were apparent. Although day 2, 7 and 30 represent distinct stages of infection and disease, there was a pronounced overlap in upregulated host genes and pathways. Type I interferon response genes (IRGs) represented up to approximate to 50% of up-regulated genes, even after loss of type I interferon induction on days 7 and 30. Bioinformatic analyses suggested a number of interferon response factors were primarily responsible for maintaining type I IRG induction. A group of genes prominent in the RNA-Seq analysis and hitherto unexplored in viral arthropathies were granzymes A, B and K. Granzyme A(-/-) and to a lesser extent granzyme K-/-, but not granzyme B-/-, mice showed a pronounced reduction in foot swelling and arthritis, with analysis of granzyme A(-/-)mice showing no reductions in viral loads but reduced NK and T cell infiltrates post CHIKV infection. Treatment with Serpinb6b, a granzyme A inhibitor, also reduced arthritic inflammation in wild-type mice. In non-human primates circulating granzyme A levels were elevated after CHIKV infection, with the increase correlating with viral load. Elevated granzyme A levels were also seen in a small cohort of human CHIKV patients. Taken together these results suggest granzyme A is an important driver of arthritic inflammation and a potential target for therapy.

TI  - Vector soup: high-throughput identification of Neotropical phlebotomine sand flies using metabarcoding
T2  - MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES
AB  - Phlebotomine sand flies are haematophagous dipterans of primary medical importance. They represent the only proven vectors of leishmaniasis worldwide and are involved in the transmission of various other pathogens. Studying the ecology of sand flies is crucial to understand the epidemiology of leishmaniasis and further control this disease. A major limitation in this regard is that traditional morphological-based methods for sand fly species identifications are time-consuming and require taxonomic expertise. DNA metabarcoding holds great promise in overcoming this issue by allowing the identification of multiple species from a single bulk sample. Here, we assessed the reliability of a short insect metabarcode located in the mitochondrial 16S rRNA for the identification of Neotropical sand flies, and constructed a reference database for 40 species found in French Guiana. Then, we conducted a metabarcoding experiment on sand flies mixtures of known content and showed that the method allows an accurate identification of specimens in pools. Finally, we applied metabarcoding to field samples caught in a 1-ha forest plot in French Guiana. Besides providing reliable molecular data for species-level assignations of phlebotomine sand flies, our study proves the efficiency of metabarcoding based on the mitochondrial 16S rRNA for studying sand fly diversity from bulk samples. The application of this high-throughput identification procedure to field samples can provide great opportunities for vector monitoring and eco-epidemiological studies.

TI  - Assembling microbial communities: a genomic analysis of a natural experiment in neotropical bamboo internodes
T2  - PEERJ
AB  - Microbes participate in ecological communities, much like multicellular organisms. However, microbial communities lack the centuries of observation and theory describing and predicting ecological processes available for multicellular organisms. Here, we examine early bacterial community assembly in the water-filled internodes of Amazonian bamboos from the genus Guadua. Bamboo stands form distinct habitat patches within the lowland Amazonian rainforest and provide habitat for a suite of vertebrate and invertebrate species. Guadua bamboos develop sealed, water-filled internodes as they grow. Internodes are presumed sterile or near sterile while closed, but most are eventually opened to the environment by animals, after which they are colonized by microbes. We find that microbial community diversity increases sharply over the first few days of environmental exposure, and taxonomic identity of the microbes changes through this time period as is predicted for early community assembly in macroscopic communities. Microbial community taxonomic turnover is consistent at the bacteria phylum level, but at the level of Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs), internode communities become increasingly differentiated through time. We argue that these tropical bamboos form an ideal study system for microbial community ecology due to their near-sterile condition prior to opening, relatively consistent environment after opening, and functionally limitless possibilities for replicates. Given the possible importance of opened internode habitats as locations of transmission for both pathogenic and beneficial microbes among animals, understanding the microbial dynamics of the internode habitat is a key conservation concern for the insect and amphibian species that use this microhabitat.

TI  - Accuracy of measures for antiretroviral adherence in people living with HIV
T2  - COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS
AB  - Background
   Good patient adherence to antiretroviral (ART) medication determines effective HIV viral suppression, and thus reduces the risk of progression and transmission of HIV. With accurate methods to monitor treatment adherence, we could use simple triage to target adherence support interventions that could help in the community or at health centres in resource-limited settings.
   Objectives
   To determine the accuracy of simple measures of ART adherence (including patient self-report, tablet counts, pharmacy records, electronic monitoring, or composite methods) for detecting non-suppressed viral load in people living with HIV and receiving ART treatment.
   Search methods
   The Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Information Specialists searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, CINAHL, African-Wide information, and Web of Science up to 22 April 2021. They also searched the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing studies. No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases.
   Selection criteria
   We included studies of all designs that evaluated a simple measure of adherence (index test) such as self-report, tablet counts, pharmacy records or secondary database analysis, or both, electronic monitoring or composite measures of any of those tests, in people living with HIV and receiving ART treatment. We used a viral load assay with a limit of detection ranging from 10 copies/mL to 400 copies/mL as the reference standard. We created 2 x 2 tables to calculate sensitivity and specificity.
   Data collection and analysis
   We screened studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias using QUADAS-2 independently and in duplicate. We assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE method. The results of estimated sensitivity and specificity were presented using paired forest plots and tabulated summaries. We encountered a high level of variation among studieswhich precluded a meaningful meta-analysis or comparison of adherence measures. We explored heterogeneity using pre-defined su bgroup analysis.
   Main results
   We included 51 studies involving children and adults with HI( mostly living in low- and middle-income settings, conducted between 2003 and 2021. Several studies assessed more than one index test, and the most common measure of adherence to ART was self-report.
   - Self-report questionnaires (25 studies, 9211 participants; very low-certainty): sensitivity ranged from 10% to 85% and specificity ranged from 10% to 99%.
   Self-report using a visual analogue scale (VAS) (11 studies, 4235 participants; very low-certainty): sensitivity ranged from 0% to 58% and specificity ranged from 55% to 100%.-
   Tablet counts (12 studies, 3466 participants; very low-certainty): sensitivity ranged from 0% to 100% and specificity ranged from 5% to
   - Electronic monitoring devices (3 studies, 186 participants; very low-certainty): sensitivity ranged from 600/0 to 88% and the specificity ranged from 27% to 67%.
   - Pharmacy records or secondary databases (6 studies, 2254 participants; very low-certainty): sensitivity ranged from 17% to 88% and the specificity ranged from 9% to 95%.
   - Composite measures (9 studies, 1513 participants; very low-certainty): sensitivity ranged from 10% to 100% and specificity ranged from 49% to 100%.
   Across ail included studies, the ability of adherence measures to detect viral non-suppression showed a large variation in both sensitivity and specificity that could not be explained by subgroup analysis. We assessed the overall certainty of the evidence as very low due to risk of bias, indirectness, inconsistency, and imprecision.
   The risk of bias and the applicability concerns for patient selection, index test, and reference standard domains were generally low or unclear due to unclear reporting. The main methodological issues identified were related to flow and timing due to high numbers of missing data. For all index tests, we assessed the certainty of the evidence as very low due to limitations in the design and conduct of the studies, applicability concerns and inconsistency of results.
   Authors' conclusions
   We encountered high variability for all index tests, and the overall certainty of evidence in all areas was very low. No measure consistently offered either a sufficiently high sensitivity orspecificityto detect viral non-suppression. These concernslimittheirvalue in triaging patients for viral load monitoring or enhanced adherence support interventions.

TI  - The Effect of Ursolic Acid on <i>Leishmania</i> (<i>Leishmania</i>) <i>amazonensis</i> Is Related to Programed Cell Death and Presents Therapeutic Potential in Experimental Cutaneous Leishmaniasis
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Among neglected tropical diseases, leishmaniasis is one of the most important ones, affecting more than 12 million people worldwide. The available treatments are not well tolerated, and present diverse side effects, justifying the search for new therapeutic compounds. In the present study, the activity of ursolic acid (UA) and oleanolic acid (OA) were assayed in experimental cutaneous leishmaniasis (in vitro and in vivo). Promastigote forms of L. amazonensis were incubated with OA and UA for 24h, and effective concentration 50% (EC50) was estimated. Ultraestructural alterations in Leishmania amazonensis promastigotes after UA treatment were evaluated by transmission electron microscopy, and the possible mode of action was assayed through Annexin V and propidium iodide staining, caspase 3/7 activity, DNA fragmentation and transmembrane mitochondrial potential. The UA potential was evaluated in intracellular amastigotes, and its therapeutic potential was evaluated in L. amazonensis infected BALB/c mice. UA eliminated L. amazonensis promastigotes with an EC50 of 6.4 mu g/mL, comparable with miltefosine, while OA presented only a marginal effect on promastigote forms at 100 mu g/mL. The possible mechanism by which promastigotes were eliminated by UA was programmed cell death, independent of caspase 3/7, but it was highly dependent on mitochondria activity. UA was not toxic for peritoneal macrophages from BALB/c mice, and it was able to eliminate intracellular amastigotes, associated with nitric oxide (NO) production. OA did not eliminate amastigotes nor trigger NO. L. amazonensis infected BALB/c mice submitted to UA treatment presented lesser lesion size and parasitism compared to control. This study showed, for the first time, that UA eliminate promastigote forms through a mechanism associated with programed cell death, and importantly, was effective in vivo. Therefore, UA can be considered an interesting candidate for future tests as a prototype drug for the treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis.

TI  - Antiprotozoal activity of Khaya anthotheca, (Welv.) CDC a plant used by chimpanzees for self-medication
T2  - JOURNAL OF ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY
AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Khaya species, endemic to Africa and Madagascar, continues to be valuable in indigenous traditional medicine. Their bitter tasting barks are decocted to treat fevers, several febrile conditions, microbial infections and worm infestations. In the Budongo rain forest of Western Uganda, non-human primates, especially chimpanzees and baboons, have been observed to eat the bitter non-nutritious bark and occasionally the seed.
   Materials and methods: Extracts were prepared by sequential fractionation with solvents of increasing polarities and assayed using standard procedures. Bioassay guided purification of the petroleum ether extract by column chromatography yielded three pure limonoids, Grandifolione (1), 7-deacetylkhivorin (2) and 1,3-deacetyldeoxyhavenensin (3). The antitrypanosomal, antileishmanial and antiplasmodial activities of pure compounds (1) and (2) were evaluated in vitro against Plasmodium falciparum K1 Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense STIB 900, Trypanosoma cruzi trypomastigotes (Tulahuen C4), and axenic Leishmania donovani MHOMET-67/L82 and for cytotoxicity against L6 rat skeletal myoblast cells, in parallel with standard drugs.
   Results: Of the four extracts tested, the petroleum ether extract showed activity against Plasmodium falciparum (IC50 0.955 mu g/ml) and Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense (IC50 5.72 mu g/ml). The pure compounds (I) and (2) demonstrated activity against Plasmodium falciparum (KI strain) and marginal activities against Trypanosoma brucei brucei, Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense, Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania donovani.
   Conclusion: The present study provides evidence justifying the use of Khaya preparations in traditional medicine to treat fevers and microbial infections. The observed antiprotozoal activity of grandifolione and 7-deacetylkhivorin from the seed of Khaya anthotheca further confirms the ethnomedicinal potential of this plant and supports the hypothesis that non-human hominids (chimpanzees and baboons) too, eat the bitter bark and seeds for self-medication and in general, the use of Khaya plant material for medication by humans in disease endemic tropical areas. The antiprotozoal activity of gradifolione, and, the antitrypanosomal and antileishmanial activities of 7-deacetylkhivorin are reported here for the first time. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

TI  - Proteomic Mapping of Multifunctional Complexes Within Triatomine Saliva
T2  - FRONTIERS IN CELLULAR AND INFECTION MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Triatomines are hematophagous insects that transmitTrypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas disease. This neglected tropical disease represents a global health issue as it is spreading worldwide. The saliva of Triatominae contains miscellaneous proteins crucial for blood feeding acquisition, counteracting host's hemostasis while performing vasodilatory, anti-platelet and anti-coagulant activities, besides modulating inflammation and immune responses. Since a set of biological processes are mediated by protein complexes, here, the sialocomplexomes (salivary protein complexes) of five species of Triatominae were studied to explore the protein-protein interaction networks. Salivary multiprotein complexes fromTriatoma infestans, Triatoma dimidiata, Dipetalogaster maxima, Rhodnius prolixus, andRhodnius neglectuswere investigated by Blue-Native- polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis coupled with liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. More than 70 protein groups, uncovering the landscape of the Triatominae salivary interactome, were revealed. Triabin, actin, thioredoxin peroxidase and an uncharacterized protein were identified in sialocomplexes of the five species, while hexamerin, heat shock protein and histone were identified in sialocomplexes of four species. Salivary proteins related to triatomine immunity as well as those required during blood feeding process such as apyrases, antigen 5, procalins, and nitrophorins compose different complexes. Furthermore, unique proteins for each triatomine species were revealed. This study represents the first Triatominae sialocomplexome reference to date and shows that the approach used is a reliable tool for the analysis of Triatominae salivary proteins assembled into complexes.

TI  - Foliar bacteria and soil fertility mediate seedling performance: a new and cryptic dimension of niche differentiation
T2  - ECOLOGY
AB  - The phyllosphere (comprising the leaf surface and interior) is one of the world's largest microbial habitats and is host to an abundant and diverse array of bacteria. Nonetheless, the degree to which bacterial communities are benign, harmful, or beneficial to plants in situ is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that the net effect of reducing bacterial abundance and diversity would vary substantially among host species (from harmful to beneficial) and this would be strongly mediated by soil resource availability. To test this, we monitored tree seedling growth responses to commercial antibiotics among replicated resource supply treatments (N,P,K) in a tropical forest in Panama for 29months. We applied either antibiotics or control water to replicated seedlings of five common tree species (Alseis blackiana, Desmopsis panamensis, Heisteria concinna, Sorocea affinis, and Tetragastris panamensis). These antibiotic treatments significantly reduced both the abundance and diversity of bacteria epiphytically as well as endophytically. Overall, the effect of antibiotics on performance was highly host specific. Applying antibiotics increased growth for three species by as much as 49% (Alseis, Heisteria, and Tetragastris), decreased growth for a fourth species by nearly 20% (Sorocea), and had no impact on a fifth species (Desmopsis). Perhaps more importantly, the degree to which foliar bacteria were harmful or not varied with soil resource supply. Specifically, applying antibiotics had no effect when potassium was added but increased growth rate by almost 40% in the absence of potassium. Alternatively, phosphorus enrichment caused the effect of bacteria to switch from being primarily beneficial to harmful or vice versa, but this depended entirely on the presence or absence of nitrogen enrichment (i.e., important and significant interactions). Our results are the first to demonstrate that the net effect of reducing the abundance and diversity of bacteria can have very strong positive and negative effects on seedling performance. Moreover, these effects were clearly mediated by soil resource availability. Though speculative, we suggest that foliar bacteria may interact with soil fertility to comprise an important, yet cryptic dimension of niche differentiation, which can have important implications for species coexistence.

TI  - Chromatin accessibility and regulatory vocabulary across indicine cattle tissues
T2  - GENOME BIOLOGY
AB  - Background Spatiotemporal changes in the chromatin accessibility landscape are essential to cell differentiation, development, health, and disease. The quest of identifying regulatory elements in open chromatin regions across different tissues and developmental stages is led by large international collaborative efforts mostly focusing on model organisms, such as ENCODE. Recently, the Functional Annotation of Animal Genomes (FAANG) has been established to unravel the regulatory elements in non-model organisms, including cattle. Now, we can transition from prediction to validation by experimentally identifying the regulatory elements in tropical indicine cattle. The identification of regulatory elements, their annotation and comparison with the taurine counterpart, holds high promise to link regulatory regions to adaptability traits and improve animal productivity and welfare. Results We generate open chromatin profiles for liver, muscle, and hypothalamus of indicine cattle through ATAC-seq. Using robust methods for motif discovery, motif enrichment and transcription factor binding sites, we identify potential master regulators of the epigenomic profile in these three tissues, namely HNF4, MEF2, and SOX factors, respectively. Integration with transcriptomic data allows us to confirm some of their target genes. Finally, by comparing our results with Bos taurus data we identify potential indicine-specific open chromatin regions and overlaps with indicine selective sweeps. Conclusions Our findings provide insights into the identification and analysis of regulatory elements in non-model organisms, the evolution of regulatory elements within two cattle subspecies as well as having an immediate impact on the animal genetics community in particular for a relevant productive species such as tropical cattle.

TI  - Situation of snakebite, antivenom market and access to antivenoms in ASEAN countries
T2  - BMJ GLOBAL HEALTH
AB  - Introduction Snakebite envenoming is a neglected tropical disease posing public health challenges globally. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries are among the tropical regions with disproportionately high incidence of snakebite. Hence, this study aimed to review the situation of snakebite, antivenom market and access to antivenoms in ASEAN. Methods This mixed-methods study included comprehensive literature review and in-depth interviews with key informants to assess the situation of management system of snakebite, antivenom market and access to antivenoms in seven ASEAN countries, including Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam, Lao PDR and Myanmar. Data were analysed by a framework method. Results ASEAN have developed various strategies to improve outcomes of snakebite victims. Five domestic antivenom manufacturers in the region produce up to 288 375 vials of antivenoms annually with the value of US$13 058 053 million which could treat 42 213 snakebite victims. However, there remain challenges to be addressed especially the lack of snakebite-related informatics system, inadequate antivenoms at the healthcare facilities and when the majority of snakebite victims seek traditional healers instead of conventional treatment. Conclusion Improving the situation of snakebite and antivenom is not only about the availability of antivenom, but the whole landscape of surrounding management and supporting system. The assessment of the situation of snakebite and antivenom is crucial for countries or regions where snakebites are prevalent to recognise their current standpoint to inform the development of strategies to achieve the goal set by the WHO of halving the global burden of snakebite by 2030.

TI  - Bacterial pathogens in Hawaiian coastal streams-Associations with fecal indicators, land cover, and water quality
T2  - WATER RESEARCH
AB  - This work aimed to understand the distribution of five bacterial pathogens in O'ahu coastal streams and relate their presence to microbial indicator concentrations, land cover of the surrounding watersheds, and physical-chemical measures of stream water quality. Twenty-two streams were sampled four times (in December and March, before sunrise and at high noon) to capture seasonal and time of day variation. Salmonella, Campylobacter, Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio vulnificus, and V. parahaemolyticus were widespread -12 of 22 O'ahu streams had all five pathogens. All stream waters also had detectable concentrations of four fecal indicators and total vibrio with log mean standard deviation densities of 2.2 +/- 0.8 enterococci, 2.7 +/- 0.7 Escherichia coli, 1.1 +/- 0.7 Clostridium perfringens, 1.2 +/- 0.8 F+ coliphages, and 3.6 +/- 0.7 total vibrio per 100 ml. Bivariate associations between pathogens and indicators showed enterococci positively associated with the greatest number of bacterial pathogens. Higher concentrations of enterococci and higher incidence of Campylobacter were found in stream waters collected before sunrise, suggesting these organisms are sensitive to sunlight. multivariate regression models of microbes as a function of land cover and physical-chemical water quality showed positive associations between Salmonella and agricultural and forested land covers, and between S. aureus and urban and agricultural land covers; these results suggested that sources specific to those land covers may contribute these pathogens to streams. Further, significant associations between some microbial targets and physical chemical stream water quality (i.e., temperature, nutrients, turbidity) suggested that organism persistence may be affected by stream characteristics. Results implicate streams as a source of pathogens to coastal waters. Future work is recommended to determine infectious risks of recreational waterbome illness related to O'ahu stream exposures and to mitigate these risks through control of land-based runoff sources.

TI  - Dynamics and Distribution of Trunk-injected Phosphite in Coconut Palm
T2  - HORTSCIENCE
AB  - Palms are an important component of landscapes in tropical, subtropical, and Mediterranean climates, but are anatomically very different from broadleaf trees. Very little is known about the movement and persistence of systemic fungicides into various parts of the palm canopy. This information is critical in selecting fungicides that may be effective against diseases that infect specific parts of the palm. In this study, potassium phosphite was injected into mature coconut palms (Cocos nucifera) at rates of 0, 30, 60, or 90 mL per tree. Various lea tissue samples were collected periodically thereafter up through 60 weeks and were analyzed for phosphite concentrations. Phosphite moved quickly into leaflet tissue, but concentrations dropped off sharply between 1 and 5 weeks after injection. This drop in leaflet concentrations was balanced by a concomitant increase in spear leaf concentrations. Phosphite persisted at high concentrations in basal rachis tissue of both old and new leaves throughout the experiment. This suggests that this material may be useful for controlling diseases that infect spear leaves and petiole or rachis tissue, but not leaflets.

TI  - Evolution of military evacuation activity in French Guiana over 10 years: a retrospective observational study
T2  - BMJ MILITARY HEALTH
AB  - Background Three permanent military operations are established in French Guiana. The Cayenne medical unit is a French military search and rescue unit and provides MEDEVAC and CASEVAC for ill and injured soldiers. The main objective of this study was to describe the temporal trends of its evacuation missions over 10 years. The secondary purpose was to document the means used for these missions. Methods This retrospective observational study included patients who were evacuated for a medical reason or an injury during military operations in French Guiana. We collected the data from the computerised registers the medical department had stored. Results From 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2019, 1070 patients were included, representing a median annual incidence of 115 (IQR 91-122) evacuations. Of these, 602 (59%) were evacuated by helicopter, 214 (21%) by airplane, 182 (18%) by ambulance and 19 (2%) by pirogue. Reasons for evacuation were diseases in 664 (62%) patients, non-battle injuries in 389 (36%) patients and battle injuries in 17 (2%) patients. Finally, 286 (29%) evacuations were MEDEVAC and 712 (71%) were CASEVAC. Over the years, the increasing number of evacuations reached a maximum of 183 in 2018. Helicopter evacuations, once the primary mode of evacuation, have declined proportionately in favour of other means of evacuation. Conclusion Evacuation missions by the Cayenne medical unit increased over the 10-year study period, while helicopter use decreased. This evolution is a response to the constraints of adapting military operations to fight against illegal gold mining in the Amazonian Forest. Improvement of the means and procedures allows provision of the best care to patients while ensuring the ongoing conduct of military operations.

TI  - National-scale spatial variations of soil magnetic susceptibility in Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES
AB  - Brazil presents high soil variability, however, the soil magnetic susceptibility (chi) distribution on national scale is yet to be investigated. Thus, soil data (218 samples from the literature and 36 original samples) were utilized to estimate soil low frequency chi (chi lf) across Brazil through machine learning algorithms (Generalized Additive Model Using Splines, Generalized Linear Model, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine) in order to assess the applicability of such methodology on a nationwide scale. Two variable groups were tested: texture and Fe2O3 contents - Group 1; and texture, Fe2O3, Al2O3, SiO2 contents - Group 2. The best performing model was applied to a database containing 3817 and 3973 georeferenced soil samples from superficial and subsuperficial horizons, respectively, obtained from soil surveys conducted by the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation. Polynomial Support Vector Machine using Group 2 variables presented the best performance (R2 = 0.91). Variable importance measurements showed that chi lf is chiefly related to Fe2O3 and clay content. The spatial distribution of chi lf on national scale varied from very high ( 150 x 10-6 m3 kg-1) to very low (<5 x 10-6 m3 kg-1), considering the interpretation bands that we propose for Brazilian soils. Extensive areas of magnetic soils were associated with their formation upon mafic rocks or iron-rich formations. Despite few exceptions, the observed tendency shows that chi lf increases parallel to soil red color, drainage and weathering degree, and hence Rhodic Nitisol, Umbric Nitisol, Rhodic Ferralsol and Umbric Ferralsol presented the highest chi lf values.

TI  - Seropositivity of Anti-<i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> and Anti-<i>Neospora caninum</i> Antibodies in Cattle Intended for Human Consumption in an Amazonian Area of North Brazil
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE
AB  - Toxoplasma gondii and Neospora caninum are obligate intracellular intestinal coccidia distributed worldwide, and are causative agents of toxoplasmosis and neosporosis, respectively. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of anti-T. gondii and anti-N. caninum antibodies and the factors associated with infections in beef cattle intended for human consumption in an Amazonian area of North Brazil. We collected blood samples of 387 cattle from 50 herds located in different municipalities of the State of Rondonia. An epidemiological questionnaire was distributed to farmers, with regard to nutritional, sanitary and reproductive herd management. The samples were identified, refrigerated and sent for serological analyses via IFAT (Immunofluorescent Antibody Test). Among the 387 analyzed animals, 91 (23.5%; CI 95%: 18.8-27.2) were positive for anti-T. gondii antibodies, with titers varying from 1:64 (75.8%) to 1:512 (2.2%). For anti-N. caninum antibodies, only four animals (1%; CI 95%: 0-2.7) were positive, with titers ranging from 1:400 (50%) to 1:1600 (25%). We observed a significant rate of anti-T. gondii antibodies in the variables "pure breed" and "contact with free-range chickens" (p < 0.2). There were no risk factors associated with the presence of anti-T. gondii or anti-N. caninum antibodies. In conclusion, there was a high prevalence of anti-T. gondii antibodies in beef cattle intended for human consumption in the State of Rondonia, Brazil, and a low prevalence of anti-N. caninum antibodies. Longitudinal studies can better elucidate the cause of these prevalence levels and how they could be better prevented and controlled.

TI  - Numerical modeling of mosquito population dynamics of <i>Aedes</i> <i>aegypti</i>
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
AB  - Background: The global incidences of dengue virus have increased the interest in studying and understanding the mosquito population dynamics. It is predominantly spread by Aedes aegypti in the tropical and sub-tropical countries in the world. Understanding these dynamics is important for public health in countries where climatic and environmental conditions are favorable for the propagation of these diseases. For this reason, a new model has been proposed to investigate the population dynamics of mosquitoes in a city.
   Methods: The present paper discusses the numerical modeling of population dynamics of Ae. aegypti mosquitoes in an urban neighborhood of a city using the finite volume method. The model describes how populations spread through the city assisted by the wind. This model allows incorporating external factors (wind and chemical insecticides) and topography data (streets, building blocks, parks, forests and beach). The proposed model has been successfully tested in examples involving two Brazilian cities (City center, Juiz de Fora and Copacabana Beach, Rio de Janeiro).
   Results: Invasion phenomena of Ae. aegypti mosquitoes have been observed in each of the simulations. It was observed that, inside the blocks, the growth of the population for both winged and aquatic phase causes an infestation of Ae. aegypti in a short time. Within the blocks the mosquito population was concentrated and diffused slowly. In the streets, there was a long-distance spread, which was influenced by wind and diffusion with a low concentration of mosquito population. The model was also tested taking into account chemical insecticides spread in two different configurations. It has been observed that the insecticides have a significant effect on the mosquito population for both winged and aquatic phases when the chemical insecticides spread more uniformly along all the streets in a neighborhood of a city.
   Conclusions: The presented methodology can be employed to evaluate and to understand the epidemic risks in a specific region of the city. Moreover the model allows an increase in efficiency of the existing mosquito population control techniques and to theoretically test new methods before involving the human population.

TI  - Mangrove biomass estimation in Southwest Thailand using machine learning
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
AB  - Mangroves play a disproportionately large role in carbon sequestration relative to other tropical forest ecosystems. Accurate assessments of mangrove biomass at the site-scale are lacking, especially in mainland Southeast Asia. This study assessed tree biomass and species diversity within a 151 ha mangrove ecosystem on the Andaman Coast of Thailand. High-resolution GeoEye-1 satellite imagery, medium resolution ASTER satellite elevation data, field-based tree measurements, published allometric biomass equations, and a suite of machine learning techniques were used to develop spatial models of mangrove biomass. Field measurements derived a whole-site tree density of 1313 trees ha(-1), with Rhizophora spp. comprising 77.7% of the trees across forty-five 400 m(2) sample plots. A support vector machine regression model was found to be most accurate by cross-validation for predicting biomass at the site level. Model-estimated above-ground biomass was 250 Mg ha(-1); below-ground root biomass was 95 Mg ha(-1). Combined above-ground and below-ground biomass for the entire 151-ha stand was 345 (+/- 72.5) Mg ha(-1), equivalent to 155 (+/- 32.6) Mg C ha(-1). Model evaluation shows the model had greatest prediction error at high biomass values, indicating a need for allometric equations determined over a larger range of tree sizes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Genetic control of blood infection levels in human malaria: Evidence for a complex genetic model
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - There is now accumulating evidence for the involvement of genetic factors in the control of immune response against malaria. These arguments come from numerous animal models, from population studies showing associations of red blood cell genetic defects as well as HLA antigens with severe malaria, and from familial studies including a recent segregation analysis, which led to detection of a major gene effect predisposing to high infection levels. The heterogeneity and complexity of this genetic control is one of the main findings of these previous studies, and probably a major cause of the difficulty in developing an effective malaria vaccine. A segregation analysis of blood infection levels is performed here in 44 pedigrees living in the tropical rain forest of southern Cameroon and exposed to high vectorial transmission intensity. The results confirm the existence of complex genetic factors controlling blood infection levels in human malaria but are not consistent with the parent-offspring transmission of a single Mendelian gene. This study also shows the dramatic effect of age on infection levels and its interaction with a putative major gene suggesting that genetic related differences are much more important in children than in adults. Further genetic studies focused on children may help to identify the nature of the genetic factors involved in the expression of human malaria, by means of linkage analyses using both familial information and genetic markers.

TI  - Intensive Circulation of Japanese Encephalitis Virus in Peri-urban Sentinel Pigs near Phnom Penh, Cambodia
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Despite the increased use of vaccination in several Asian countries, Japanese Encephalitis (JE) remains the most important cause of viral encephalitis in Asia in humans with an estimated 68,000 cases annually. Considered a rural disease occurring mainly in paddy-field dominated landscapes where pigs are amplifying hosts, JE may nevertheless circulate in a wider range of environment given the diversity of its potential hosts and vectors. The main objective of this study was to assess the intensity of JE transmission to pigs in a peri-urban environment in the outskirt of Phnom Penh, Cambodia. We estimated the force of JE infection in two cohorts of 15 sentinel pigs by fitting a generalised linear model on seroprevalence monitoring data observed during two four-month periods in 2014. Our results provide evidence for intensive circulation of JE virus in a periurban area near Phnom Penh, the capital and most populated city of Cambodia. Understanding JE virus transmission in different environments is important for planning JE virus control in the long term and is also an interesting model to study the complexity of vector-borne diseases. Collecting quantitative data such as the force of infection will help calibrate epidemiological model that can be used to better understand complex vector-borne disease epidemiological cycles.

TI  - Short-Term Exposure to Warm Microhabitats Could Explain Amphibian Persistence with <i>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</i>
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Environmental conditions can alter the outcomes of symbiotic interactions. Many amphibian species have declined due to chytridiomycosis, caused by the pathogenic fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), but many others persist despite high Bd infection prevalence. This indicates that Bd's virulence is lower, or it may even be a commensal, in some hosts. In the Australian Wet Tropics, chytridiomycosis extirpated Litoria nannotis from high-elevation rain forests in the early 1990 s. Although the species is recolonizing many sites, no population has fully recovered. Litoria lorica disappeared from all known sites in the early 1990 s and was thought globally extinct, but a new population was discovered in 2008, in an upland dry forest habitat it shares with L. nannotis. All frogs of both species observed during three population censuses were apparently healthy, but most carried Bd. Frogs perch on sun-warmed rocks in dry forest streams, possibly keeping Bd infections below the lethal threshold attained in cooler rain forests. We tested whether short-term elevated temperatures can hamper Bd growth in vitro over one generation (four days). Simulating the temperatures available to frogs on strongly and moderately warmed rocks in dry forests, by incubating cultures at 33 degrees C for one hour daily, reduced Bd growth below that of Bd held at 15 degrees C constantly (representing rain forest habitats). Even small decreases in the exponential growth rate of Bd on hosts may contribute to the survival of frogs in dry forests.

TI  - Additive and non-additive responses of seedlings to simulated herbivory and drought
T2  - BIOTROPICA
AB  - Drought is a global threat, increasing in severity and frequency throughout tropical ecosystems. Although plants often face drought in conjunction with biotic stressors, such as herbivory or disease, experimental studies infrequently test the simultaneous effects of drought and biotic stress. Because multiple simultaneous stressors may have non-additive and complex effects on plant performance, it is difficult to predict plant responses to multiple threats from research examining one stress at a time. Using an experimental approach in the greenhouse, we investigated potential non-additivity in seedling growth and survival to simulated drought and herbivory across a phylogenetically diverse pool of ten Hawaiian plant species. Overall, seedlings showed limited tolerance, defined as similar growth and survival in stressed compared with control (non-stressed) plants, to simulated herbivory and drought, with the combined effects of both stressors to be generally additive and negative across species. Significant variation in stress tolerance was detected among species, and species variation was explained, at least in part, by functional traits such that species with larger root/shoot ratios and smaller seeds, tended to demonstrate greater herbivory and drought tolerance. Future research incorporating additional trait analysis and different stressors could shed light on mechanisms underlying seedling stress tolerance and clarify whether additivity, as detected in this study, extends across other combinations of stressors. Such work will provide needed insights into the regeneration of seedlings in tropical forests under threats of herbivory and climate change.

TI  - Extracting Tea Plantations from Multitemporal Sentinel-2 Images Based on Deep Learning Networks
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB  - Tea is a special economic crop that is widely distributed in tropical and subtropical areas. Timely and accurate access to the distribution of tea plantation areas is crucial for effective tea plantation supervision and sustainable agricultural development. Traditional methods for tea plantation extraction are highly dependent on feature engineering, which requires expensive human and material resources, and it is sometimes even difficult to achieve the expected results in terms of accuracy and robustness. To alleviate such problems, we took Xinchang County as the study area and proposed a method to extract tea plantations based on deep learning networks. Convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) modules were combined to build an R-CNN model that can automatically obtain both spatial and temporal information from multitemporal Sentinel-2 remote sensing images of tea plantations, and then the spatial distribution of tea plantations was predicted. To confirm the effectiveness of our method, support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), CNN, and RNN methods were used for comparative experiments. The results show that the R-CNN method has great potential in the tea plantation extraction task, with an F1 score and IoU of 0.885 and 0.793 on the test dataset, respectively. The overall classification accuracy and kappa coefficient for the whole region are 0.953 and 0.904, respectively, indicating that this method possesses higher extraction accuracy than the other four methods. In addition, we found that the distribution index of tea plantations in mountainous areas with gentle slopes is the highest in Xinchang County. This study can provide a reference basis for the fine mapping of tea plantation distributions.

TI  - Ecology and Evolution of Avian Malaria: Implications of Land Use Changes and Climate Change on Disease Dynamics
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE
AB  - Malaria is the deadliest of all mosquito-borne diseases. Thousands of malaria parasite species exploit squamate reptiles, birds, and mammals as vertebrate hosts as well as dipteran vectors. Among these, avian malaria and related parasites have revealed an extensive genetic diversity as well as phenotypic diversity with varying virulence, host range, distribution-offering an amenable experimental system which has played a key role in understanding the ecology and evolution of human malaria parasites. Since its discovery in 1885, avian malaria contributed a great deal to the success of the U.S. antimalarial program during World War II. From modelling the links between climate change and health from a conservation and public health perspectives, avian malaria offered new opportunities and a relatively tractable system which were otherwise diluted by socio-economic, vector control and infra-structural changes in the human malaria context. In this review, I highlight the importance of avian malaria research in understanding the influence of climate change, land use and deforestation on disease dynamics, and how this helps to understand the ecology and evolution of the disease both from human and wildlife perspectives.

TI  - Transmission of West Nile and five other temperate mosquito-borne viruses peaks at temperatures between 23°C and 26°C
T2  - ELIFE
AB  - The temperature-dependence of many important mosquito-borne diseases has never been quantified. These relationships are critical for understanding current distributions and predicting future shifts from climate change. We used trait-based models to characterize temperature-dependent transmission of 10 vector-pathogen pairs of mosquitoes (Culex pipiens, Cx. quinquefascsiatus, Cx. tarsalis, and others) and viruses (West Nile, Eastern and Western Equine Encephalitis, St. Louis Encephalitis, Sindbis, and Rift Valley Fever viruses), most with substantial transmission in temperate regions. Transmission is optimized at intermediate temperatures (23-26 degrees C) and often has wider thermal breadths (due to cooler lower thermal limits) compared to pathogens with predominately tropical distributions (in previous studies). The incidence of human West Nile virus cases across US counties responded unimodally to average summer temperature and peaked at 24 degrees C, matching model-predicted optima (24-25 degrees C). Climate warming will likely shift transmission of these diseases, increasing it in cooler locations while decreasing it in warmer locations.

TI  - Effects of Land-Use and Environmental Factors on Snail Distribution and Trematode Infection in Ethiopia
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE
AB  - Freshwater snails are intermediate hosts for several snail-borne diseases affecting humans and animals. Understanding the distribution of snail intermediate hosts and their infection status is very important to plan and implement effective disease prevention and control interventions. In this study, we determined the abundance, distribution, and trematode infection status of freshwater snails in two agro-ecological zones of Ethiopia. We sampled snails from 13 observation sites and examined them for trematode infections using a natural cercarial shedding method. A redundancy analysis (RDA) was used to examine the relationship between snail abundance and environmental variables. Overall, a total of 615 snails belonging to three species were identified. Lymnea natalensis and Bulinus globosus were the dominant snail species, representing 41% and 40% of the total collection, respectively. About one-third of the total snail population (33%) shed cercariae. The cercariae species recorded were Xiphidiocercaria, Brevifurcate apharyngeate distome (BAD), Echinostome, and Fasciola. Snail species were found in high abundance in aquatic habitats located in the agricultural landscape. Therefore, land-use planning and protection of aquatic habitats from uncontrolled human activities and pollution can be considered as important strategies to prevent and control the spread of snail-borne diseases in the region.

TI  - Patterns of a Sylvatic Yellow Fever Virus Amplification in Southeastern Senegal, 2010
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - During the wet season of 2010, yellow fever virus (YFV) was detected in field-collected mosquitoes in the Kedougou region in southeastern Senegal. During this outbreak, we studied the association of the abundance of YFV-infected mosquitoes and land cover features to try and understand the dynamics of YFV transmission within the region. In total, 41,234 mosquito females were collected and tested for virus infection in 5,152 pools. YFV was detected in 67 pools; species including Aedes furcifer (52.2% of the infected pools), Ae. luteocephalus (31.3% of the infected pools), Ae. taylori (6.0% of the infected pools) and six other species (10.4% of the infected pools) captured in September (13.4%), October (70.1%), and November (16.4%). Spatially, YFV was detected from mosquitoes collected in all land cover classes but mainly, forest canopies (49.2%). Human infection is likely mediated by Ae. furcifer, the only species found infected with YFV within villages. Villages containing YFV-infected mosquitoes were significantly closer to large forests (>2 ha) than villages in which no infected mosquitoes were detected.

TI  - Intestinal Parasitism in Free-Ranging Black-Headed Night Monkeys,<i>Aotus nigriceps</i>, of Southeastern Peru
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY
AB  - The study of intestinal parasite communities is an important aspect of conservation biology, disease ecology, and wildlife health. Researchers can use the presence of select micro- and macroparasites as an indicator of host health. Only two studies have sampled intestinal parasites in free-rangingAotusmonkeys despite their wide geographic distribution in Central and South America. We therefore conducted a survey of gastrointestinal parasites using 50 fecal samples from seven free-ranging black-headed night monkey (Aotus nigriceps) groups at three field sites in the Peruvian Amazon. We calculated an index of habitat quality using Gentry transects and compared this with parasite communities. We recovered seven intestinal parasite taxa:Strongyloidessp.;Balantioidessp.;Trypanoxyurissp.;Entamoebasp.; and unidentified species of ascarid, strongylid, and trematode. Two of these taxa have previously been described in captiveAotus nigriceps(Balantioidessp. andStrongyloidessp.). Parasite richness ranged from zero to five taxa with a mean of 0.8 parasite taxa (+/- 1.0 SD) per fecal sample. Fifty-six percent of samples had at least one intestinal parasite taxon. We found all seven parasite taxa in the wet season but onlyStrongyloidessp. andTrypanoxyurissp. in the dry season.Balantioidessp. was positively associated with bothEntamoebasp. and an unidentified trematode, whileEntamoebasp. was positively associated with the unidentified ascarid (P< 0.05). Extrapolations support the likelihood of recovering additional intestinal parasite taxa with increased sampling effort. Neither group size nor basal area was significantly associated with parasite richness. These results highlight the need for continued surveillance ofAotusparasites both temporally and across heterogeneous landscapes because several of the parasite taxa we found are pathogenic in nonhuman primates and people.

TI  - Reduced fertility in triploids of <i>Acacia auriculiformis</i> and its hybrid with <i>A-mangium</i>
T2  - EUPHYTICA
AB  - Polyploid breeding offers the possibility of increased variability in the search for improved growth, site adaptation and disease resistance in tropical acacias. A key focus of breeding in Vietnam has been the production and testing of vigorous triploid clones which are expected to have the added advantage of being sterile. Triploids obtained by manual crosses between diploid and tetraploid trees or by bulk screening of seedlings derived from open-pollinated seedlots were verified using flow cytometry. Thirteen clones are under field testing for growth rate, tree form and fertility. Six of these are now reproductively mature and flowered as prolifically as diploids. However no pollen germinated, either on agar or on their own stigmas under controlled pollination. Only one clone (X01-F-1 hybrid of tetraploid A. mangium and diploid A. auriculiformis) produced open pollinated pods on 0.05% of hermaphrodite flowers and these contained an average of 1.3 filled seeds per pod, about one-fifth the number observed in diploids. Less than 25% of germinated progeny from this triploid clone survived at 3 months after sowing and survivors were severely stunted with arrested growth. Ploidy and genotype analysis revealed them to be predominantly aneuploids, ranging from hyperdiploid to hypotetraploid with 95% being selfs. We are confident that we can select triploid clones which will be effectively infertile if deployed in plantations and may be of particular value in situations where the normal prolific natural regeneration of tropical acacias is highly undesirable.

TI  - <i>Lutzomyia</i> Sand Fly Diversity and Rates of Infection by <i>Wolbachia</i> and an Exotic <i>Leishmania</i> Species on Barro Colorado Island, Panama
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background: Sand flies ( Diptera, Psychodidae, Phlebotominae) in the genus Lutzomyia are the predominant vectors of the protozoan disease leishmaniasis in the New World. Within the watershed of the Panama Canal, the cutaneous form of leishmaniasis is a continuous health threat for residents, tourists and members of an international research community. Here we report the results of screening a tropical forest assemblage of sand fly species for infection by both Leishmania and a microbe that can potentially serve in vector population control, the cytoplasmically transmitted rickettsia, Wolbachia pipientis. Knowing accurately which Lutzomyia species are present, what their evolutionary relationships are, and how they are infected by strains of both Leishmania and Wolbachia is of critical value for building strategies to mitigate the impact of this disease in humans.
   Methodology and Findings: We collected, sorted and then used DNA sequences to determine the diversity and probable phylogenetic relationships of the Phlebotominae occurring in the understory of Barro Colorado Island in the Republic of Panama. Sequence from CO1, the DNA barcoding gene, supported 18 morphology-based species determinations while revealing the presence of two possible "cryptic'' species, one (Lu. sp. nr vespertilionis) within the Vespertilionis group, the other ( Lu. gomezi) within the Lutzomyia-cruciata series. Using ITS-1 and "minicircle'' primers we detected Leishmania DNA in 43.3% of Lu. trapidoi, 26.3% of Lu. gomezi individuals and in 0% of the other 18 sand fly species. Identical ITS-1 sequence was obtained from the Leishmania infecting Lu. trapidoi and Lu. gomezi, sequence which was 93% similar to Leishmania ( viannia) naiffi in GenBank, a species previously unknown in Panama, but recognized as a type of cutaneous leishmaniasis vectored broadly across northern and central South America. Distinct strains of the intracellular bacterium Wolbachia were detected in three of 20 sand fly species, including Lu. trapidoi, in which it frequently co-occurred with Leishmania.
   Conclusions: Both morphological and molecular methods were used to examine an assemblage of 20 sand fly species occurring in the forests of the Panama Canal area. Two of these species, members of separate clades, were found to carry Leishmania at high frequency and hence are likely vectors of leishmaniasis to humans or other mammal species. A single Leishmania species, identified with high confidence as Le. naiffi, was carried by both species. That Le. naiffi is known to cause cutaneous lesions in South America but has hitherto not been reported or implicated in Panama opens the possibility that its range has recently expanded to include the Isthmus or that it occurs as a recent introduction. The occurrence of Leishmania and Wolbachia in Lu. trapidoi identifies one important vector of the disease as a potential target for gene introductions using Wolbachia population sweeps.

TI  - Impact of climate change on dengue fever epidemics in South and Southeast Asian settings: A modelling study
T2  - INFECTIOUS DISEASE MODELLING
AB  - The potential for dengue fever epidemic due to climate change remains uncertain in tropical areas. This study aims to assess the impact of climate change on dengue fever transmission in four South and Southeast Asian settings. We collected weekly data of dengue fever incidence, daily mean temperature and rainfall from 2012 to 2020 in Singapore, Colombo, Selangor, and Chiang Mai. Projections for temperature and rainfall were drawn for three Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP126, SSP245, and SSP585) scenarios. Using a disease transmission model, we projected the dengue fever epidemics until 2090s and determined the changes in annual peak incidence, peak time, epidemic size, and outbreak duration. A total of 684,639 dengue fever cases were reported in the four locations between 2012 and 2020. The projected change in dengue fever transmission would be most significant under the SSP585 scenario. In comparison to the 2030s, the peak incidence would rise by 1.29 times in Singapore, 2.25 times in Colombo, 1.36 times in Selangor, and >10 times in Chiang Mai in the 2090s under SSP585. Additionally, the peak time was projected to be earlier in Singapore, Colombo, and Selangor, but be later in Chiang Mai under the SSP585 scenario. Even in a milder emission scenario of SSP126, the epidemic size was projected to increase by 5.94%, 10.81%, 12.95%, and 69.60% from the 2030s-2090s in Singapore, Colombo, Selangor, and Chiang Mai, respectively. The outbreak durations in the four settings were projected to be prolonged over this century under SSP126 and SSP245, while a slight decrease is expected in 2090s under SSP585. The results indicate that climate change is expected to increase the risk of dengue fever transmission in tropical areas of South and Southeast Asia. Limiting greenhouse gas emissions could be crucial in reducing the transmission of dengue fever in the future. & COPY; 2023 The Authors.

TI  - The Occurrence and Economic Impact of Plasmodiophora brassicae and Clubroot Disease
T2  - JOURNAL OF PLANT GROWTH REGULATION
AB  - The significance of Plasmodiophora brassicae Woronin and clubroot disease which it incites in members of the family Brassicaceae is reviewed as the focus for this special edition of the Journal of Plant Growth Regulation. This is a monographic treatment of recent research into the pathogen and disease; previous similar treatments are now well over half a century old. Vernacular nomenclature of the disease indicates that it had a well-established importance in agriculture and horticulture from at least the Middle Ages onward in Europe and probably earlier. Subsequently, the pathogen probably spread worldwide as a result of transfer on and in fodder taken by colonists as livestock feed. It is a moot point, however, whether there was much earlier spread by P. brassicae into China and subsequently Japan as Brassica rapa (Chinese cabbage and many variants) colonized those lands in archaeological time. Symptoms, worldwide distribution, and economic impact are briefly described here to provide a basis for understanding subsequent papers. Clubroot disease devastates both infected field and protected vegetable and agricultural Brassica crops. Particular importance is placed on recent reports of crop losses in tropical countries, albeit where the crops are grown in cooler altitudes, and in the Canadian prairie land canola crops. The latter is of enormous importance because this crop is the single most important and essential source of vegetable oils used in human foodstuffs and in industrial lubricants where mineral oils are inappropriate.

TI  - Multinomial Logistic Model for Coinfection Diagnosis Between Arbovirus and Malaria in Kedougou
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOSTATISTICS
AB  - In tropical regions, populations continue to suffer morbidity and mortality from malaria and arboviral diseases. In Kedougou (Senegal), these illnesses are all endemic due to the climate and its geographical position. The co-circulation of malaria parasites and arboviruses can explain the observation of coinfected cases. Indeed there is strong resemblance in symptoms between these diseases making problematic targeted medical care of coinfected cases. This is due to the fact that the origin of illness is not obviously known. Some cases could be immunized against one or the other of the pathogens, immunity typically acquired with factors like age and exposure as usual for endemic area. Thus, coinfection needs to be better diagnosed. Using data collected from patients in Kedougou region, from 2009 to 2013, we adjusted a multinomial logistic model and selected relevant variables in explaining coinfection status. We observed specific sets of variables explaining each of the diseases exclusively and the coinfection. We tested the independence between arboviral and malaria infections and derived coinfection probabilities from the model fitting. In case of a coinfection probability greater than a threshold value to be calibrated on the data, long duration of illness and age are mostly indicative of arboviral disease while high body temperature and presence of nausea or vomiting symptoms during the rainy season are mostly indicative of malaria disease.

TI  - Synergistic potential of dual-polarized synthetic aperture radar and multispectral optical imagery for invasive alien species detection and mapping
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Invasive alien species are a major threat to global biodiversity and result in adverse environmental and socioeconomic implications, such as reduced ecosystem services, landscape productivity, and costly eradication initiatives. The ability to monitor the extent and spread of alien species invasions provides valuable insight for the mitigation of these adverse implications. The generation of Earth Observation (EO) Sentinel sensor provides unprecedented freely available imagery, which is suitable for both local and regional invasive species monitoring. Specifically, its radar (S1) and optical (S2) sensors offer unique tandem datasets valuable for landscape analysis. Hence, we sought to determine the synergistic potential of fused S1 dual-polarized synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery with S2 optical imagery for invasive alien species detection and mapping. S1 and S2 imageries were fused at the feature level, and the support vector machine algorithm used for the multiclass image classification. Results indicated that the fusion of the S1 dual-polarized imagery with S2 optical imagery produced the highest classification accuracy (85%), whereas stand-alone S2 optical bands produced the lowest classification accuracy (79%). Findings from this study underline the significant synergistic potential and complementarity of new-age S2 optical imagery and dual-polarized S1 SAR imagery for invasive alien species detection and mapping. Due to large swath, higher pixel resolution, free availability, and possible tandem complementarity between optical and SAR sensors, we recommend Sentinel EO imagery as an economically viable option for the invasive alien species detection and mapping.

TI  - Disease control and health systems in low- and middle-income countries: enhancing positive interrelation
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE & INTERNATIONAL HEALTH
AB  - There is a growing interest in improving the relationship between disease control programmes and the rest of the health system in low- and middle-income countries. This short study seeks to contribute to this movement by providing a multi-dimensional approach for policy-makers and researchers. It recognizes the different and often conflicting perspectives in health systems held by stakeholders. Two such perspectives are those of disease control programmes and health systems. Both are based on perceived health needs and put forward requirements on each other through resource demands and organizational needs. Failure to reconcile these perspectives can lead to health system fragmentation. This study proposes a framework to address the importance of mutual support across stakeholder perspectives, striving to understand and analyse the consequences of their reciprocal views. In doing this, the study stresses the importance of common understanding around health system values, the political interplay between stakeholders, the contextual setting and the need to integrate research and capacity development in this area.

TI  - The epidemiology of hepatitis delta virus infection in Cameroon
T2  - GUT
AB  - Objective To investigate the distribution and risk factors of hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infection in Cameroon.
   Design We tested for hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen (HBsAg) and anti-HDV antibody 14150 samples collected during a survey whose participants were representative of the Cameroonian adult population. The samples had already been tested for hepatitis C virus and HIV antibodies.
   Results Overall, 1621/14 150 (weighted prevalence=11.9%) participants were HBsAg positive, among whom 224/1621 (10.6%) were anti-HDV positive. In 2011, the estimated numbers of HBsAg positive and HDV seropositives were 1160799 and 122910 in the 15-49 years age group, respectively. There were substantial regional variations in prevalence of chronic HBV infection, but even more so for HDV (from 1% to 54%). In multivariable analysis, HDV seropositivity was independently associated with living with an HDV-seropositive person (OR=8.80; 95% CI: 3.23 to 24.0), being HIV infected (OR=2.82; 95%CI: 1.32 to 6.02) and living in the South (latitude <4 degrees N) while having rural/outdoor work (OR=15.2; 95%CI: 8.35 to 27.6, when compared with living on latitude >= 4 degrees N and not having rural/outdoor work).
   Conclusion We found evidence for effective intra-household transmission of HDV in Cameroon. We also identified large differences in prevalence between regions, with cases concentrated in forested areas close to the Equator, as described in other tropical areas. The reasons underlying these geographical variations in HDV prevalence deserve further investigation.

TI  - HUMAN IMPACTS HAVE SHAPED HISTORICAL AND RECENT EVOLUTION IN <i>AEDES AEGYPTI</i>, THE DENGUE AND YELLOW FEVER MOSQUITO
T2  - EVOLUTION
AB  - Although anthropogenic impacts are often considered harmful to species, human modifications to the landscape can actually create novel niches to which other species can adapt. These "domestication" processes are especially important in the context of arthropod disease vectors, where ecological overlap of vector and human populations may lead to epidemics. Here, we present results of a global genetic study of one such species, the dengue and yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti, whose evolutionary history and current distribution have been profoundly shaped by humans. We used DNA sequences of four nuclear genes and 1504 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers developed with restriction-site associated DNA (RAD) sequencing to test the hypothesis that Ae. aegypti originated in Africa, where a domestic form arose and spread throughout the tropical and subtropical world with human trade and movement. Results confirmed African ancestry of the species, and supported a single subspeciation event leading to the pantropical domestic form. In addition, genetic data strongly supported the hypothesis that human trade routes first moved domestic Ae. aegypti out of Africa into the New World, followed by a later invasion from the New World into Southeast Asia and the Pacific. These patterns of domestication and invasion are relevant to many species worldwide, as anthropogenic forces increasingly impact evolutionary processes.

TI  - New Elite Potato Clones with Heat Tolerance, Late Blight and Virus Resistance to Address Climate Change
T2  - Potato and Sweetpotato in Africa: Transforming the Value Chains for Food and Nutrition Security
CP  - 9th Triennial African Potato Association Conference
AB  - Potato production in developing countries is expanding to warmer environments as farmers search for income opportunities and food security. Meanwhile, climate change is already affecting weather patterns in traditional potato-growing areas, Where unpredictable rains and pressure from pests and disease are increasing farmers' risk. Since 2004, the International Potato Center (CIP) has sought to develop new, more heat-tolerant generations of its tropical highland-adapted late-blight resistant population. Late-blight resistant parents were crossed with early maturing and virus resistant progenitors, and selection practised under warm temperatures, water deficit and mid-latitude conditions. During the 2005-2006 summer season (January March) 20,000 genotypes were exposed to heat in a screen house at CIP's experimental station in San Ramon, a warm rain forest environment at 800 m above sea level (mast) and latitude 11 degrees 08' S. Selected clones were assessed in the field in the same location, Where average night and day temperatures during tuberization were and,-7 _n, respectively; the resulting heat tolerant clones were exposed to high, endemic late blight pressure in Oxapampa (mid-elevation humid tropics) in replicated trials conducted over 4 years. Selected heat tolerant, late blight resistant clones were evaluated for yield components in the spring summer season in La Molina (12 degrees 05' S) and drought sensitivity in Majes (16 degrees 28' S) along the arid coast of Peru. Sixty-one advanced clones were assessed again for yield in San Ramon, La Molina and Majes and yield stability analysed. All trials were conducted in a simple lattice design, using Desiree as a heat tolerant control. Harvesting was performed at 90 days. The 61 clones were screened for resistance to potato virus X (PVX) and potato virus Y (PVY), by mechanical inoculation and grafting under greenhouse conditions. Analysis of variance for marketable tuber yield showed significant differences among clones. In San Ramon, yields were in the range of 16.01-28.43 (t/ha), significantly exceeding the control. Of the 40 mid-maturing elite clones selected from the new 'LBW' (late blight resistant heat tolerant) population, with resistance to late blight, tolerance to heat, 11 carry extreme resistance to PVY, 25 to PVX and seven show tolerance to drought. Eleven mid-maturing clones with heat tolerance, resistance to late blight and PVY that are suitable for mid-elevation zones mid climate change, and all 40 clones, are available for variety development and further use in breeding.

TI  - Analysis of exhaled breath for dengue disease detection by low-cost electronic nose system
T2  - MEASUREMENT
AB  - This paper presents a procedure and a set-up of an electronic nose system analyzing exhaled breath to detect the patients suffering from dengue - a mosquito-borne tropical disease. Low-power resistive gas sensors (MiCS-6814, TGS8100) were used to detect volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the exhaled breath. The end-tidal phase of patients exhaled breath was collected with a BioVOC (TM) breath sampler. Two strategies were assessed for breath samples measurement: either direct transfer from the BioVOC (TM) into the sensors test chamber, or storage in Tenax TA sorbent tubes followed by VOCs release through thermal desorption and then transfer into sensors test chamber. DC sensor resistances were recorded and processed by multivariate classifier algorithms to detect infected patients. The experimental studies were run on a group of 26 individuals (16 dengue diagnosed patients and 10 control volunteers). The detection accuracy of dengue patients was over 90%.

TI  - Tolerance of three <i>Aedes albopictus</i> strains (Diptera: Culicidae) from different geographical origins towards winter temperatures under field conditions in northern Germany
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - The continuing spread of the Asian tiger mosquito Aedes albopictus, a vector of many arboviruses and some dirofilarial worms, in Europe calls for advanced investigations on its ecological ability to establish and overwinter in temperate, more northern geographic regions. To meet this purpose, eggs of Ae. albopictus laboratory strains of tropical, subtropical and temperate origin were exposed to field conditions during one or two winter seasons in northeastern Germany. After 1 to 16 weeks of outdoor exposure, eggs were flooded in the laboratory, and the hatching rates were determined. During the winter season 2015/2016, when temperatures reached -10 degrees C, the subtropical strain showed hatching after all time periods while the tropical strain displayed hatching only until two weeks of cold exposure. In the winter season 2016/2017, with temperatures as low as -6 degrees C, all three strains produced hatching larvae after all time periods. Both the hatching rates and the hatching behaviour differed between the strains. Larvae of the subtropical and temperate strains hatched in installments over a period of four weeks while the larvae of the tropical strain hatched within a short time period, often one week. The results of the study demonstrate that Ae. albopictus strains of different, even tropical, origin might be able to survive a central European winter, although this is likely to depend on the specific course of the temperatures. Further studies with different temperature regimes and different mosquito strains are needed to specify these findings.

TI  - Description of high rates of unapparent and simultaneous multiple dengue virus infection in a Colombian jungle settlement
T2  - TROPICAL BIOMEDICINE
AB  - Dengue disease statistics is mainly based on consulting patients with febrile illness, but misdiagnosed and asymptomatic cases are important to measure dengue epidemiology in endemic areas. The main objective of this work was to determine the prevalence of IgM and IgG antibodies or NS1 antigen and viral RNA in a group of healthy volunteers from an isolated village in Colombian Choco rain forest. It found 51.7% of virologically PCR confirmed asymptomatic cases, despite low IgM seroprevalence. It was confirmed that all four serotypes are in the circulation and in 17.2% of individuals it detected natural coinfections of two or three different serotypes simultaneously. This is the first report in Colombia evaluating viremia in asymptomatic volunteers. These findings pose a big concern about the transmission of dengue virus by asymptomatic individuals because they can spread the virus without take appropriate control measures.

TI  - Rare and phylogenetically distinct plant species exhibit less diverse root-associated pathogen communities
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
AB  - One of the central questions in ecology is why some species are abundant while others are rare. In plant communities, some studies show that rare plant species are rare because they suffer stronger negative density-dependent effects from pathogens compared to abundant plant species. Moreover, such pathogen effects are also suggested to be related to phylogenetic distance among plant species. However, the importance of pathogens has been commonly inferred by treating the entire pathogen community as a "black box" without explicitly characterizing pathogen richness and community composition. Here, we test two predictions. First, if rare plant species are more susceptible to pathogens, we predict that rare plant species are associated with a higher richness of specialists (i.e., pathogens that attack only a single plant species) and/or the total pathogen community. If phylogenetically distinct plant species are less susceptible to pathogens, we predict that plant species with higher phylogenetic distinctiveness (i.e., a measure of how phylogenetically distant a species is from other co-occurring species) are associated with a lower richness of phylogenetic specialists (i.e., pathogens that attack closely related plant species) and/or the total pathogen community. We conducted a survey of the root-associated pathogen communities from 45 plant species in a subtropical forest. We showed that approximately 40% and 25% of the pathogens were specialists and phylogenetic specialists respectively. In contrast to our first prediction, the richness of the total pathogen community but not the richness of the specialists was found to be positively related to plant species abundance, indicating that rare plant species suffer less from pathogens. Consistent with our second prediction, both the richness of the phylogenetic specialists and the total pathogen community were found to be negatively related to plant species phylogenetic distinctiveness. Furthermore, these correlations were stronger at the earlier plant life stages examined. Synthesis. We found that the root-associated pathogen communities were less diverse in rare plant species and plant species with few close relatives. These associations varied across multiple plant life stages, suggesting that the strength of the above-ground-below-ground interactions change dynamically across plant life span.

TI  - THE FUTURE OF OIL PALM AS A MAJOR GLOBAL CROP: OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES
T2  - JOURNAL OF OIL PALM RESEARCH
AB  - In recent years, the oil palm sector has witnessed a period of historically high prices with buoyant global demand and high levels of production driven largely by economic development in major Asian countries such as India and China. However, the oil palm sector is also confronted by many important challenges that require attention. Such challenges include fragmentation of the industry, stagnating yields, and an image problem that is largely due to the conversion of tropical rainforest and peatlands in a few regions in South-east Asia. The biological and managerial tools to surmount these challenges already exist but need more focussed application and political support. Potentially groundbreaking biological tools include the new molecular breeding technologies, such as those made possible by the recent publication of the oil palm genome sequence (Singh et al., 2013a, b). Two key R&D targets for the industry are:
   higher oil yield in fruits and trees; and
   higher mesocarp oleic acid composition preferably over 65% w/w.
   The more focussed use of new and traditional technologies can also help to confront pest and disease problems, to redesign of crop architecture, and to facilitate yield and harvesting efficiency. In the mediumterm future, we can look forward to a considerable geographical extension of oil palm cultivation in a broad zone across the tropics of Africa, Asia and the Americas. If these and other measures can be taken, increased palm oil output could more than meet the highest projections for future vegetable oil requirements while minimising adverse environmental consequences. Improved oil palm varieties could also considerably increase the global market share for this highly productive tropical crop at the expense of some of the less efficient temperate oilseed crops.

TI  - Implications of Insecticide-Treated Mosquito Net Fishing in Lower Income Countries
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Insecticide-treated mosquito nets (ITNs) are highly effective for the control of malaria. Yet widely distributed ITNs have been repurposed as fishing nets throughout the world.
   OBJECTIVES: Herein we present a synthesis of the current knowledge of ITN fishing and the toxicity of pyrethroids and discuss the potential implications of widespread fishing with ITNs. We further review effective management strategies in tropical fisheries to explore a framework for managing potential ITN fishing impacts.
   DISCUSSION: Pyrethroids are toxic to fish and aquatic environments, and fishing with ITNs may endanger the health of fisheries. Furthermore, although human toxicity to the pyrethroid insecticides that impregnate ITNs is traditionally thought to be low, recent scientific advances have shown that pyrethroid exposure is associated with a host of human health issues, including neurocognitive developmental disorders, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Although it is known that ITN fishing is widespread, the implications for both fisheries and human communities is understudied and may be severe. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP7001

TI  - Humidity and low pH boost occurrence of Onygenales fungi in soil at global scale
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Soils are important reservoirs for potential human pathogens and opportunistic fungi such as the dermatophyte or dimorphic fungi in the order Onygenales. In soils, these taxa are decomposers but many of them have the potential to cause respiratory and skin diseases in humans and, in some cases, systemic infections. Even so, the factors that determine the biogeography and ecology of order Onygenales remain largely undocumented. To address this knowledge gap, we surveyed members of Onygenales from topsoil fungal communities at 235 sites across six continents and provided a first global atlas. We retrieved 4.3% of the total fungal sequences (~420 Onygenales) across nine biomes ranging from deserts to tropical forests. This work advances our knowledge on the ecology and global distribution of order Onygenales and suggests the hypothesis that wet and acid soils support the larger proportions of these fungi, while their richness is constrained by aridity.

TI  - First report of <i>Leptolegnia chapmanii</i> (Peronosporomycetes: Saprolegniales) affecting mosquitoes in central Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF INVERTEBRATE PATHOLOGY
AB  - Numerous isolates of an oomycete 'fungus', Leptolegnia chapmanii, are reported from Brazil for the first time. This aquatic pathogen was baited with Aedes aegypti sentinel larvae from stagnant, temporary bodies of water in selected locations under secondary tropical forest in and near the central Brazilian city of Goiania and from more distant sites in the western and northern regions of the state of Goias. Isolates were identified based on their morphological and developmental characters, comparative sequence data for the ITS and TEF loci, as well as their rapid activity against A. aegypti larvae. Taxonomic issues affecting the application of the name L. chapmanii and its typification are rectified. This study contributes to a better understanding of the presence and distribution of this oomycete in Brazil, its sequence-based identification, and of its potential as a biological agent against mosquito vectors.

AB  - In 2009, the Franceville International Medical Research Center (CIRMF) celebrated its 30th anniversary, at the same time as the Republic of Gabon celebrated the 50th anniversary of its independence. The CIRMF went into operation in 1979 when the president of the Republic, M. Omar Bongo Ondimba, decided to establish it in partnership with the Elf-Aquitaine corporation. Three decades later, it was time to assess its work. The day of this 30th anniversary, more than 300 people were working at the Center. To convince the authorities to make a major investment, the Directorate-General of the CIRMF presented the successful results obtained for science, the projects underway and planned, and its international outreach. Mission accomplished: in 2009 a renovation of the CIRMF began. It has worked successfully in the following fields of research: antiretroviral agents, hepatitis viruses, the diversity of plasmodium, emerging viral diseases, and still topics such as neonatal diagnosis of sickle-cell anemia and an exhaustive inventory of the fauna and flora of the tropical forest. The CIRMF has achieved success and can be proud of its 30th anniversary of international biomedical research in the natural environment of Gabon.

   Results: Sixty-nine phytochemicals which include lignans, acylated iridoid glycosides, acylated rhamnopyranoses, flavonoids, flavones, flavone glycosides have been isolated. Many of them have been characterized for their pharmacological activity. Several researchers have identified bioactive phytochemicals like luteolin, iridoid alkaloids from the leaves, hentriacontanol and lignans such as arboreol, isoarboreol, arborone, gmelanone, gummadiol from the heartwood, flavon glycosides in roots. The extracts are reported to have wound-healing and antidiarrheal properties. Various studies demonstrated that G.arborea and its constituents possess several pharmacological activities like anti-oxidant, anti-diabetic, anti-inflammatory, antiulcer, analgesic, anti-nociceptive, anticancer and wound healing activities.
   Conclusion: G. arborea is a valuable medicinal plant used traditionally in the Indian Systems of Medicine (ISM Ayurveda and Unani) to treat a wide variety of ailments. These phytochemicals are highly bioactive and exhibit various pharmacological activities. However, pharmacological activities of many compounds which have been identified, are yet to be understood.

TI  - Morphological variability in the malaria vector, <i>Anopheles moucheti</i>, is not indicative of speciation: evidences from sympatric south Cameroon populations
T2  - INFECTION GENETICS AND EVOLUTION
AB  - Anopheles moucheti is a major human malaria vector in the vicinity of slow moving rivers in the tropical forests of Central Africa. Morphological variations in natural populations of A. moucheti led to the designation of three morphological forms named A. moucheti moucheti, A. moucheti nigeriensis and A. moucheti bervoetsi. Using allozyme markers, we investigated to which extent morphological and/or geographical populations of A. moucheti were genetically differentiated. Mosquitoes were collected from four villages 20-200 km distant apart in south Cameroon, where specimens from each morphological form were found in sympatry. All populations appeared highly homogenous across both morphological type and geographic location. Significant genetic differentiation was only observed between two locations 150 km apart (F-st = 0.029; P = 0.006), while no pairwise F-st estimate between morphological forms reached statistical significance. Further evidence against any taxonomic value of this morphological classification was provided by direct observation of morphological variation within the progeny of field-collected females from all three types. Single female offspring always belonged to at least two morphologically recognised types and most often, a mixture of all three forms was observed. Our results therefore demonstrate that morphological variability within A. moucheti natural populations is not indicative of speciation. With this respect, restricted migration of individuals across river systems may be a more important factor in shaping population genetic structure of A. moucheti. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

TI  - Strengthening health research capacity in sub-Saharan Africa: mapping the 2012-2017 landscape of externally funded international postgraduate training at institutions in the region
T2  - GLOBALIZATION AND HEALTH
AB  - Background: The objective was to guide key stakeholders on future directions of external funding of international postgraduate training (Master's and PhD) of health research students at institutions in sub-Saharan Africa by mapping the numbers and characteristics of students, the location of institutions, and sources of external support. A cross-sectional survey of eligible external funding organizations and programmes was conducted in 2017. Information was gathered from funders' websites or through the assistance of institutional contacts. The information requested included the number of Master's and PhD grantees supported from January 2012 to June 2017, as well as each grantee's institution of study, gender, country of origin and research area.
   Results: Of 72 organizations contacted, there were 44 responses. Of the 44, 30 funders reported programmes within the inclusion criteria, and 19 funders provided data on relevant programmes. The Wellcome Trust, the International Development Research Centre and the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation supported the greatest number of grantees. There was concentrated support for grantees in eastern and southern Africa, countries with developed research capacity, and highly-developed research and training centres. More support was provided for PhD than Master's degree programmes and for research areas more upstream along the research spectrum. Challenges were identified in recognizing relevant funding organizations and obtaining responses. Information was presented inconsistently across organizations, which were often unable to provide relevant and complete data within the survey timeframe.
   Conclusions: External funders should collect, analyse and report data at regular intervals on their support for strengthening postgraduate health research capacity in sub-Saharan Africa. Standardization of this process and development of an online database would not only help to avoid overlap between programmes and promote synergy between funders, but also inform dialogue between external funders and key stakeholders on strategic issues. These issues include how external funders can a) optimise their support for research capacity strengthening to maximise the benefits of research for health and development on an equitable basis, and b) optimise the distribution of support for researchers at different career stages and for research on different parts of the research spectrum to maximise the health benefits of research.

TI  - ECOLOGICAL DISTRIBUTION OF CHIKUNGUNYA HEMAGGLUTINATION INHIBITION ANTIBODIES IN HUMAN AND DOMESTIC-ANIMALS IN NIGERIA
T2  - TROPICAL AND GEOGRAPHICAL MEDICINE
AB  - A serological survey to detect presence of antibodies to Chikungunya virus in 477 human sera randomly sampled from four ecological zones of Nigeria was carried out employing a haemagglutination inhibition (HI) test.  Similarly 220 animal sera collected mostly from the northern parts of Nigeria were screened for HI antibody to Chikungunya virus.
   Of the 477 human sera tested a total of 68 or 14.3% were found to possess Chikungunya HI antibodies made up of 10% in swampy forest, 20% in the rain forest, 14% in the derived savannah and 6.7% in the guinea savannah.  Such sera positive for Chikungunya HI antibodies were further screened against other circulating alphaviruses of which 17 or 25% were positive to Igbo-Ora virus, 6 or 38.1% to Semliki forest virus and 36 or 52.6% were positive to Sindbis virus.  Five or 2.3% of the 220 animal sera screened were found to possess Chikungunya HI antibodies.

TI  - Epidemic and Non-Epidemic Hot Spots of Malaria Transmission Occur in Indigenous <i>Comarcas</i> of Panama
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - From 2002-2005, Panama experienced a malaria epidemic that has been associated with El Nino Southern Oscillation weather patterns, decreased funding for malaria control, and landscape modification. Case numbers quickly decreased afterward, and Panama is now in the pre-elimination stage of malaria eradication. To achieve this new goal, the characterization of epidemiological risk factors, foci of transmission, and important anopheline vectors is needed. Of the 24,681 reported cases in these analyses (2000-2014), similar to 62% occurred in epidemic years and similar to 44% in indigenous comarcas (5.9% of Panama's population). Subanalyses comparing overall numbers of cases in epidemic and non-epidemic years identified females, comarcas and some 5-year age categories as those disproportionately affected by malaria during epidemic years. Annual parasites indices (APIs; number of cases per 1,000 persons) for Plasmodium vivax were higher in comarcas compared to provinces for all study years, though P. falciparum APIs were only higher in comarcas during epidemic years. Interestingly, two comarcas report increasing numbers of cases annually, despite national annual decreases. Inclusion of these comarcas within identified foci of malaria transmission confirmed their roles in continued transmission. Comparison of species distribution models for two important anophelines with Plasmodium case distribution suggest An. albimanus is the primary malaria vector in Panama, confirmed by identification of nine P. vivax-infected specimen pools. Future malaria eradication strategies in Panama should focus on indigenous comarcas and include both active surveillance for cases and comprehensive anopheline vector surveys.

TI  - Zika virus congenital syndrome: experimental models and clinical aspects
T2  - JOURNAL OF VENOMOUS ANIMALS AND TOXINS INCLUDING TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Viral infections have long been the cause of severe diseases to humans, increasing morbidity and mortality rates worldwide, either in rich or poor countries. Yellow fever virus, H1N1 virus, HIV, dengue virus, hepatitis B and C are well known threats to human health, being responsible for many million deaths annually, associated to a huge economic and social cost. In this context, a recently introduced flavivirus in South America, called Zika virus (ZIKV), led the WHO to declare in February 1st 2016 a warning on Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). ZIKV is an arbovirus of the Flaviviridae family firstly isolated from sentinels Rhesus sp. monkeys at the Ziika forest in Uganda, Africa, in 1947. Lately, the virus has well adapted to the worldwide spread Aedes aegypti mosquito, the vector for DENV, CHIKV, YFV and many others. At first, it was not considered a threat to human health, but everything changed when a skyrocketing number of babies born with microcephaly and adults with Guillain-Barre syndrome were reported, mainly in northeastern Brazil. It is now well established that the virus is responsible for the so called congenital Zika syndrome (CZS), whose most dramatic features are microcephaly, arthrogryposis and ocular damage. Thus, in this review, we provide a brief discussion of these main clinical aspects of the CZS, correlating them with the experimental animal models described so far.

TI  - Disease Severity, Resistance Analysis, and Expression Profiling of Pathogenesis-Related Protein Genes after the Inoculation of <i>Fusarium equiseti</i> in Wheat
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
AB  - Wheat (Triticum aestivum) is an important cereal crop, grown throughout the temperate and in some tropical and sub-tropical zones, at higher elevations. Several biotic and abiotic factors influence the production of wheat. In the present study, two wheat varieties have been subjected to disease severity and resistance analysis against Fusarium equiseti. Disease severity analysis revealed Shafaq-2006 to be more resistant than Sahar-2006. Both varieties were further subjected to the expression analysis of six important defense-related genes by RT-PCR and quantitative real-time PCR. This analysis revealed that PR-1, TLP, Chitinase, and beta-1,3-glucanase genes were highly expressed in Shafaq-2006 and possibly play a significant role in its defense mechanism. In addition, biochemical and physiochemical parameters were also studied to further explore the difference between resistant and susceptible varieties. With total proline and protein contents, sugar and chlorophyll contents also increased significantly in resistant variety. Likewise, higher relative water content, total plant length, and the high root-shoot ratio was observed in resistant plants, compared to susceptible wheat plants. These increases in chemical and physiological parameters might be related to the activation of the defense mechanism due to the higher expression of PR genes in the resistant wheat variety. These genes can further be employed for cloning into wheat and other transgenic crops to develop resistance against F. equiseti.

TI  - Detection and Establishment of <i>Aedes notoscriptus</i> (Diptera: Culicidae) Mosquitoes in Southern California, United States
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - Aedes notoscriptus (Skuse), the Australian backyard mosquito, is a pestiferous daytime-biting species native to Australia and the surrounding southwestern Pacific region. It is suspected to play a role in the transmission of several arboviruses and is considered a competent vector of dog heartworm, Dirofilaria immitis (Leidy).This highly adaptable mosquito thrives in natural and artificial water-holding containers in both forested and urbanized areas, from tropical to temperate climates, and has benefitted from a close association with humans, increasing in abundance within its native range. It invaded and successfully established in New Zealand as well as in previously unoccupied temperate and arid regions of Australia. Ae. notoscriptus was discovered in Los Angeles County, CA, in 2014, marking the first time this species had been found outside the southwestern Pacific region. By the end of 2019, immature and adult mosquitoes had been collected from 364 unique locations within 44 cities spanning three southern California counties. The discovery, establishment, and rapid spread of this species in urban areas may signal the global movement and advent of a new invasive container-inhabiting species. The biting nuisance, public health, and veterinary health implications associated with the invasion of southern California by this mosquito are discussed.

TI  - Changes in Phlebotomine Sand Fly Species Composition Following Insecticide Thermal Fogging in a Rural Setting of Western Panama
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - American Cutaneous Leishmaniasis, ACL, is a zoonotic disease with a large richness of co-occurring vector species in transmission foci. Here, we describe changes in patterns of phlebotomine sand fly (Diptera: Psychodidae: Phlebotominae) species composition at the village of Trinidad de Las Minas, Capira, Panama, a hyperendemic focus of ACL transmission, subjected to a vector control intervention with insecticide thermal fogging (ITF). Our study setting consisted of 24 houses, 12 subjected to two rounds of ITF and 12 kept as control. During 15 months (April 2010- June 2011) we monitored sand fly species composition and abundance with modified HP light traps inside (domicile) and outside (peridomicile) the studied houses. From 5628 sand flies collected, we were able to identify 5617 of the samples into 24 species, a number of species close to 25 +/- 1.6, the estimate from the Chao2 Index. The most abundant species were Lutzomya trapidoi (20%), Lu. gomezi (20%) and Lu. triramula (20%). Cluster analyses showed that most of the 24 houses had high similarity in relative abundance patterns of the six most common species, with only few peripheral houses not following the main cluster pattern. We also found that species richness was decreased to 22 species in the fogged houses, of which only 19 were found in the domiciliary environment. Changes in species richness were especially notorious at the end of the wet season. Our results suggest that species richness can decrease following ITF in domiciliary environments, primarily affecting the less common species.

TI  - Prediction of solar energy guided by pearson correlation using machine learning
T2  - ENERGY
AB  - Solar energy forecasting represents a key element in increasing the competitiveness of solar power plants in the energy market and reducing the dependence on fossil fuels in economic and social development. This paper presents an approach for predicting solar energy, based on machine and deep learning techniques. The relevance of the studied models was evaluated for real-time and short-term solar energy forecasting to ensure optimized management and security requirements in this field while using an integral solution based on a single tool and an appropriate predictive model. The datasets we used in this study, represent data from 2016 to 2018 and are related to Errachidia which is a semi desert climate province in Morocco. Pearson correlation coefficient was deployed to identify the most relevant meteorological inputs from which the models should learn. RF and ANN have provided high accuracies against LR and SVR, which have reported very significant errors. ANN has shown good performance for both real-time and short-term predictions. The key findings were compared with Pirapora in Brazil, which is a tropical climate region, to show the quality and reproducibility of the study.

TI  - Temperature explains broad patterns of Ross River virus transmission
T2  - ELIFE
AB  - Thermal biology predicts that vector-borne disease transmission peaks at intermediate temperatures and declines at high and low temperatures. However, thermal optima and limits remain unknown for most vector-borne pathogens. We built a mechanistic model for the thermal response of Ross River virus, an important mosquito-borne pathogen in Australia, Pacific Islands, and potentially at risk of emerging worldwide. Transmission peaks at moderate temperatures (26.4 degrees C) and declines to zero at thermal limits (17.0 and 31.5 degrees C). The model accurately predicts that transmission is year-round endemic in the tropics but seasonal in temperate areas, resulting in the nationwide seasonal peak in human cases. Climate warming will likely increase transmission in temperate areas (where most Australians live) but decrease transmission in tropical areas where mean temperatures are already near the thermal optimum. These results illustrate the importance of nonlinear models for inferring the role of temperature in disease dynamics and predicting responses to climate change.

TI  - Leishmanicidal Activity of <i>Piper nigrum</i> Bioactive Fractions is Interceded via Apoptosis <i>In Vitro</i> and Substantiated by Th1 lmmunostimulatorv Potential <i>In Vivo</i>
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a life-threatening protozoal infection chiefly impinging the rural and poor population in the tropical and sub-tropical countries. The deadly affliction is rapidly expanding after its association with AIDS, swiftly defying its status of a neglected disease. Despite successful formulation of vaccine against canine leishmaniasis, no licensed vaccine is yet available for human VL, chemotherapy is in appalling state, and the development of new candidate drugs has been painfully slow. In face of lack of proper incentives, immunostimulatory plant preparations owing antileishmanial efficacy bear potential to rejuvenate awful antileishmanial chemotherapy. We have earlier reported profound leishmanicidal activity of Piper nigrum hexane (PNH) seeds and P nigrum ethanolic (PNE) fractions derived from P nigrum seeds against Leishmania donovani promastigotes and amastigotes. In the present study, we illustrate that the remarkable anti-promastigote activity exhibited by PNH and PNE is mediated via apoptosis as evidenced by phosphatidylserine externalization, DNA fragmentation, arrest in sub G(0)/G(1) phase, loss of mitochondria' membrane potential and generation of reactive oxygen species. Further, P nigrum bioactive fractions rendered significant protection to L. donovani infected BALB/c mice in comparison to piperine, a known compound present in Piper species. The substantial therapeutic potential of PNH and PNE was accompanied by elicitation of cell-mediated immune response. The bioactive fractions elevated the secretion of Thl (INF-gamma, TNF-alpha, and IL-2) cytokines and declined IL-4 and IL-10. PNH and PNE enhanced the production of IgG2a, upregulated the expression of co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86, augmented splenic CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell population, induced strong lymphoproliferative and DTH responses and partially stimulated NO production. PNH and PNE were devoid of any hepatic or renal toxicity. These encouraging findings merit further exploration of P nigrum bioactive fractions as a source of potent and non-toxic antileishmanials.

TI  - Singapore's 5 decades of dengue prevention and control-Implications for global dengue control
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Author summaryA densely populated, highly urban tropical city-state with long-established populations of Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus mosquitoes, plus travel and trade links to all corners of the world, Singapore is ideally suited for dengue transmission. Singapore's experience and rich surveillance data provide important insights for an increasingly large number of territories at risk of dengue epidemics. Decades of vector control efforts, focused on source reduction and surveillance, have successfully lowered the vector population, with accompanying reductions in the resident population's seroprevalence to dengue. We propose that Singapore's vulnerability to outbreaks is due to low levels of immunity in the population, constant introduction of viral variants, expanding urban centres, and increasing human density. The discord between the rising trend in reported cases and falling seroprevalence could be at least partly attributed to improved diagnostics and surveillance. Singapore's evidence-based vector-control programme, which involves strong partnership between the public and private sectors, will continue to adapt to future challenges in this space.
   This paper summarises the lessons learnt in dengue epidemiology, risk factors, and prevention in Singapore over the last half a century, during which Singapore evolved from a city of 1.9 million people to a highly urban globalised city-state with a population of 5.6 million. Set in a tropical climate, urbanisation among green foliage has created ideal conditions for the proliferation of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, the mosquito vectors that transmit dengue. A vector control programme, largely for malaria, was initiated as early as 1921, but it was only in 1966 that the Vector Control Unit (VCU) was established to additionally tackle dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) that was first documented in the 1960s. Centred on source reduction and public education, and based on research into the bionomics and ecology of the vectors, the programme successfully reduced the Aedes House Index (HI) from 48% in 1966 to <5% in the 1970s. Further enhancement of the programme, including through legislation, suppressed the Aedes HI to around 1% from the 1990s. The current programme is characterised by 4 key features: (i) proactive inter-epidemic surveillance and control that is stepped up during outbreaks; (ii) risk-based prevention and intervention strategies based on advanced data analytics; (iii) coordinated inter-sectoral cooperation between the public, private, and people sectors; and (iv) evidence-based adoption of new tools and strategies. Dengue seroprevalence and force of infection (FOI) among residents have substantially and continuously declined over the 5 decades. This is consistent with the observation that dengue incidence has been delayed to adulthood, with severity highest among the elderly. Paradoxically, the number of reported dengue cases and outbreaks has increased since the 1990s with record-breaking epidemics. We propose that Singapore's increased vulnerability to outbreaks is due to low levels of immunity in the population, constant introduction of new viral variants, expanding urban centres, and increasing human density. The growing magnitude of reported outbreaks could also be attributed to improved diagnostics and surveillance, which at least partially explains the discord between rising trend in cases and the continuous reduction in dengue seroprevalence. Changing global and local landscapes, including climate change, increasing urbanisation and global physical connectivity are expected to make dengue control even more challenging. The adoption of new vector surveillance and control tools, such as the Gravitrap and Wolbachia technology, is important to impede the growing threat of dengue and other Aedes-borne diseases.

TI  - Molecular taxonomy of <i>Crocidura</i> species (Eulipotyphla: Soricidae) in a key biogeographical region for African shrews, Nigeria
T2  - COMPTES RENDUS BIOLOGIES
AB  - The taxonomy of African shrew species is still unresolved due to their conserved morphology. This also affects knowledge concerning their geographic distribution. In Nigeria, using mitochondrial Cytochrome b gene sequences, we carried out a survey for shrews from the genus Crocidura across various ecological zones to determine taxa that are present and also to assess their phylogeographic structure. Our analyses include 183 specimens collected with Sherman traps from 19 localities around the country. We detected six taxa: Crocidura olivieri lineages II, III and IV, C. hildegardeae, C. jouvenetae, and C. foxi. Among these, C. hildegardeae and C. jouvenetae are reported in Nigeria for the first time. Phylogenetic comparison of our genetic sequences to those generated from other parts of Africa demonstrate that all species in our study, as currently defined, are in need of taxonomic revision. Geographically, Nigeria seems to represent the easternmost boundary for C. olivieri lineage II and C. jouvenetae, and the western distribution limit of C. olivieri lineage IV and C. hildegardeae. The Niger River appears to be the most significant topographical barrier restricting these taxa. This information is vital to preserving the diversity but also managing the epidemiological potential of these small mammals. (C) 2019 Academie des sciences. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB  - Current trans fat replacement strategies provide food products with acceptable textural and sensory properties on a large scale, and at a reasonable price, but carry health and environmental burdens. Palm oil is used extensively because of its high solidity and functionality; however, increased production has led to deforestation throughout the world's tropical regions. To reduce dependence on palm oil it is necessary to find a means of structuring a variety of readily available vegetable oils. Using cottonseed and peanut oils, among others, we show that enzymatic glycerolysis can structure liquid oils into solid fats through monoacylglycerol and diacylglycerol production from their native triacylglycerols without the addition of saturated or hydrogenated fat, thus not altering fatty acid composition. Solid fat contents of cottonseed and peanut oils were increased from 8% to 29% and 9% to 30% at 5 degrees C, respectively, and 21% and 10% at 20 degrees C, respectively. Additionally, oil-binding capacity was enhanced significantly. These novel oils were used to produce margarine and peanut butter with similar textural properties to commercial products and, importantly, represent a healthy and sustainable means to replace hydrogenated or saturated fats. Palm oil has certain functional advantages as an ingredient in food products, including textual and sensory properties, and as a trans fat replacement. A well-established technique, enzymatic glycerolysis, is used here to structure liquid cottonseed and peanut oils into solid fats without altering fatty acid composition, which may advance the structure, nutrition and sustainability of commercial products

TI  - Real-time DNA barcoding in a rainforest using nanopore sequencing: opportunities for rapid biodiversity assessments and local capacity building
T2  - GIGASCIENCE
AB  - Background: Advancements in portable scientific instruments provide promising avenues to expedite field work in order to understand the diverse array of organisms that inhabit our planet. Here, we tested the feasibility for in situ molecular analyses of endemic fauna using a portable laboratory fitting within a single backpack in one of the world's most imperiled biodiversity hotspots, the Ecuadorian Choco rainforest. We used portable equipment, including the MinION nanopore sequencer (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) and the miniPCR (miniPCR), to perform DNA extraction, polymerase chain reaction amplification, and real-time DNA barcoding of reptile specimens in the field. Findings: We demonstrate that nanopore sequencing can be implemented in a remote tropical forest to quickly and accurately identify species using DNA barcoding, as we generated consensus sequences for species resolution with an accuracy of >99% in less than 24 hours after collecting specimens. The flexibility of our mobile laboratory further allowed us to generate sequence information at the Universidad Tecnologica Indoamerica in Quito for rare, endangered, and undescribed species. This includes the recently rediscovered Jambato toad, which was thought to be extinct for 28 years. Sequences generated on the MinION required as few as 30 reads to achieve high accuracy relative to Sanger sequencing, and with further multiplexing of samples, nanopore sequencing can become a cost-effective approach for rapid and portable DNA barcoding. Conclusions: Overall, we establish how mobile laboratories and nanopore sequencing can help to accelerate species identification in remote areas to aid in conservation efforts and be applied to research facilities in developing countries. This opens up possibilities for biodiversity studies by promoting local research capacity building, teaching nonspecialists and students about the environment, tackling wildlife crime, and promoting conservation via research-focused ecotourism.

TI  - Strengthening the influenza vaccine virus selection and development process Report of the 3rd WHO Informal Consultation for Improving Influenza Vaccine Virus Selection held at WHO headquarters, Geneva, Switzerland, 1-3 April 2014
T2  - VACCINE
AB  - Despite long-recognized challenges and constraints associated with their updating and manufacture, influenza vaccines remain at the heart of public health preparedness and response efforts against both seasonal and potentially pandemic influenza viruses.
   Globally coordinated virological and epidemiological surveillance is the foundation of the influenza vaccine virus selection and development process. Although national influenza surveillance and reporting capabilities are being strengthened and expanded, sustaining and building upon recent gains has become a major challenge.
   Strengthening the vaccine virus selection process additionally requires the continuation of initiatives to improve the timeliness and representativeness of influenza viruses shared by countries for detailed analysis by the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS).
   Efforts are also continuing at the national, regional, and global levels to better understand the dynamics of influenza transmission in both temperate and tropical regions. Improved understanding of the degree of influenza seasonality in tropical countries of the world should allow for the strengthening of national vaccination policies and use of the most appropriate available vaccines.
   There remain a number of limitations and difficulties associated with the use of HAI assays for the antigenic characterization and selection of influenza vaccine viruses by WHOCCs. Current approaches to improving the situation include the more-optimal use of HAI and other assays; improved understanding of the data produced by neutralization assays; and increased standardization of serological testing methods.
   A number of new technologies and associated tools have the potential to revolutionize influenza surveillance and response activities. These include the increasingly routine use of whole genome next-generation sequencing and other high-throughput approaches. Such approaches could not only become key elements in outbreak investigations but could drive a new surveillance paradigm. However, despite the advances made, significant challenges will need to be addressed before next-generation technologies become routine, particularly in low-resource settings.
   Emerging approaches and techniques such as synthetic genomics, systems genetics, systems biology and mathematical modelling are capable of generating potentially huge volumes of highly complex and diverse datasets. Harnessing the currently theoretical benefits of such bioinformatics ("big data") concepts for the influenza vaccine virus selection and development process will depend upon further advances in data generation, integration, analysis and dissemination.
   Over the last decade, growing awareness of influenza as an important global public health issue has been coupled to ever-increasing demands from the global community for more-equitable access to effective and affordable influenza vaccines. The current influenza vaccine landscape continues to be dominated by egg-based inactivated and live attenuated vaccines, with a small number of cell-based and recombinant vaccines. Successfully completing each step in the annual influenza vaccine manufacturing cycle will continue to rely upon timely and regular communication between the WHO GISRS, manufacturers and regulatory authorities.
   While the pipeline of influenza vaccines appears to be moving towards a variety of niche products in the near term, it is apparent that the ultimate aim remains the development of effective "universal" influenza vaccines that offer longer-lasting immunity against a broad range of influenza A subtypes.

TI  - Ecologic correlates of <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> exposure in free-ranging neotropical mammals
T2  - JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE DISEASES
AB  - A serologic survey for Toxoplasma gondii in 18 free-ranging forest mammal species (n=456) in French Guiana was undertaken with a direct agglutination test. Serum antibody prevalence varied from 0-71%. The relationships between ecologic features of the species and seroprevalence were investigated. Terrestrial mammals were significantly more exposed to T gondii than other mammals. This result is concordant with oral exposure to T gondii related to ground dwelling behavior and/or carnivory.

TI  - Distribution, description, and local knowledge of larval habitats of <i>Anopheles gambiae</i> s.l. in a village in western Kenya
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - A sampling census revealed 104 aquatic habitats of 6 types for Anopheles gambiae s.l. larvae in a village in western Kenya, namely burrow pits, drainage channels, livestock hoof prints, rain pools, tire tracks, and pools in streambeds. Most habitats were created by human activity and were highly clustered in dispersion pattern within the village landscape. Landscape analysis revealed that six of forty-seven 0.09 km(2) cells superimposed over the village harbored 65% of all habitats. Focus group discussions and in-depth interviews with villagers revealed the extent of knowledge of the village residents of larval habitats, mosquito sources in the local environment, and what might be done to prevent mosquito breeding. Participants did not associate specific habitats with anopheline larvae, expressed reluctance to eliminate habitats because they were sources of domestic water supply, but indicated willingness to participate in a source reduction program if support were available.

TI  - AVIFAUNAL SURVEYS OF THE UPPER APURIMAC RIVER VALLEY, AYACUCHO AND CUZCO DEPARTMENTS, PERU: NEW DISTRIBUTIONAL RECORDS AND BIOGEOGRAPHIC, TAXONOMIC, AND CONSERVATION IMPLICATIONS
T2  - WILSON JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY
AB  - The sliver of humid tropical and montane forest on the east slope of the Andes in Ayacucho Department ranks among the least surveyed sectors of the Peruvian Andes. This mountainous region, along with adjacent Apurimac Department and western Cuzco Department, comprise the Apurimac River Valley, a putative biogeographic barrier. Hence, understanding avian distributions in the vicinity of the Apurimac River Valley is fundamental to understanding faunal turnover across it. Here, we report results of recent avifaunal surveys (2008-2012) from five sites in the Apurimac Valley region. We report 35 bird species previously undocumented in Ayacucho, six of which represent range extensions, including records of the endemic Black-spectacled Brush-Finch (Atlapetes melanopsis), Marcapata Spinetail (Cranioleuca marcapatae), and Chestnut-breasted Mountain-Finch (Poospiza caesar); the remaining records filled perceived range gaps. Specimen evidence suggests little phenotypic introgression between differentiated forms across the region, except for apparent introgression zones in Superciliaried Hemispingus (Hemispingus superciliaris) and Mountain Cacique (Cacicus chrysonotus); these observations uphold the idea that the Apurimac River Valley functions to isolate bird populations. Specimens of two Grallaria sp. and one Scytalopus sp. may represent new taxa, two of which appear to be endemic to Ayacucho (the third extends into adjacent Junin Department). More generally, montane forest bird species richness and avian endemism in eastern Ayacucho are similar to those of Cuzco and Pasco departments; previous assessments that considered Ayacucho as an area of reduced diversity were misled by sparse sampling effort.

TI  - Low temperature tolerance of three <i>Aedes albopictus</i> strains (Diptera: Culicidae) under constant and fluctuating temperature scenarios
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
AB  - BackgroundAedes albopictus, a vector of numerous viruses and filarial worms, has already established in 20 countries in Europe, mainly colonising subtropical regions. Continuing adaptation to climatic conditions in temperate areas would probably result in a spread to more northern European countries, producing an increasing risk of mosquito-borne pathogen transmission over a much greater area. Based on previous studies showing that Ae. albopictus is able to overwinter in Germany, this study aims to determine more exactly its ecological limits of enduring low temperatures.MethodsNon-diapausing and experimentally induced diapausing eggs of three different Ae. albopictus strains (tropical, subtropical and temperate origins) were exposed to four different regimes with constant temperatures and three different regimes with fluctuating temperatures in a course of a day for a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 30 days. The hatching rate of larvae after cold exposure of the eggs was taken as a measure of cold tolerance.ResultsThe experiments showed that the tropical Ae. albopictus strain had a lower cold tolerance than the subtropical and the temperate strains. The eggs of all used strains were able to survive constant temperatures as low as -5 degrees C for an exposure period of 30 days, while constant temperatures as low as -10 degrees C were endured for 2 days by the tropical strain and for 10 and 20 days by the subtropical and temperate strains, respectively. At fluctuating temperatures, both the subtropical and the temperate strains exhibited hatching under all temperature regimes, even with a minimum temperature of -10 degrees C, whereas the tropical strain ceased hatching after an exposure period of 30 days under the temperature regime with a minimum temperature of -10 degrees C. The analyses showed that the temperature played the major role in interpreting the hatching rates of the eggs. The condition, whether the eggs were diapausing or not, had no significant influence, although results indicated a slightly higher cold tolerance of diapausing eggs at -10 degrees C.ConclusionsIt must be expected that subtropical and temperate strains of Ae. albopictus are able to withstand common central European winters and are able to establish in considerable parts of the continent.

TI  - Chromosomes, RAPDs and evolutionary trends of the Neotropical fish <i>Mimagoniates microlepis</i> (Teleostei: Characidae: Glandulocaudinae) from coastal and continental regions of the Atlantic forest, Southern Brazil
T2  - ACTA ZOOLOGICA
AB  - Chromosome and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers of samples of Mimagoniates microlepis were studied to test the hypothesis that a vicariant event occurred as the result of the orogeny of the coastal mountain range (Serra do Mar; southeastern and southern Brazil). Conventional karyotypes and nucleolar organizer region (Ag-NOR) phenotypes of two samples of M. microlepis from the headwaters of the Iguacu River (southern Brazil) were compared both with each other and with other local populations of the species in the coastal drainage of southeastern Brazil. Additional molecular data (RAPD markers and genetic diversity) were obtained from specimens from coastal and continental regions of southern Brazil. The same diploid number (52 chromosomes), karyotypic formula and Ag-NOR phenotype were found for both analysed samples from the Iguacu River. A genetic discontinuity was discovered in the comparison of the karyotypical formula of the Iguacu samples with those from coastal drainages of the region. Polymerase chain reaction-RAPD markers revealed strikingly different molecular profiles between coastal and continental samples and indications of a high degree of genetic variation. Based on these results, we provide some comments on the biogeographical patterns and evolutionary trends for M. microlepis from coastal and continental regions of southeastern/southern Brazil.

TI  - Epidemiological study of snakebite cases in Sikkim: Risk modeling with regard to the habitat suitability of common venomous snakes
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background Snakebite envenoming is listed as category 'A' Neglected Tropical Disease. To achieve the target of WHO (World Health Organization) 2019, it becomes necessary to understand various attributes associated with snakebite including community awareness, improvisation of medical facilities and to map the potential distribution of venomous snakes responsible for the bite. Hence this study is conducted in Sikkim, India to understand the epidemiology of snakebite in Sikkim. The potential distribution and risk mapping of fivecommon venomous snakes are done for effective management of snakebite cases.
   Methods and findings The snakebite cases registered in six district hospitals and four PHCs (Primary Health Centers) of Sikkim were collected from the year 2011 to 2018. Community survey was also conducted to supplement the data. Ecological Niche Modeling (ENM) was performed to predict the potential habitat of five common venomous snakes of Sikkim. Therisk modeling of snakebite cases was done at the level of Gram Panchayat Unit (GPU) using Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) and Ordinary Linear Square (OLS) model. We found higher number of male victims inflicted with snakebite envenomation. The potential distribution of the five venomous snakes showed satisfactory mean AUC (Area under Curve) value. Both the models showed significant positive association of snakebite cases with habitat suitability of the venomous snakes.Hospital data revealed no death cases whereas community data reported 24 deaths.
   Conclusions Death from snakebite reflected in community data but not in hospital data strongly indicates the people's belief in traditional medicine. Though people of Sikkim have rich traditional knowledge, in case of snakebite traditional practices may be ineffective leading to loss of life. Sensitizing people and improving medical facilities along with proper transport facilities in rural areas might significantly reduce the snakebite casualties in the state.
   Author summary Snakebite is a global burden especially inflicting despair and torment among agronomist rural population of the society. This study has been conducted in small state of Sikkim in India which has not been actually considered so far in any of the national statistical condensation of snakebite cases. There are around 19 venomous snakes found in Sikkim of which five common ones co-exist with humans. Such co-existence may lead to unintentional encounter posing life threatening snakebite. People of Sikkim have strong belief on traditional healers for treatment of snakebite which results in mortality and morbidity. The present epidemiological study provides the baseline information compiling both hospital and community data and predict the areas having higher risk of snakebite envenomation in Sikkim. This study will help the authorities for better preparedness to deal with snakebite emergency to achieveminimum or no mortality. Potential risk mapping will help the health department for stocking the anti-venom in nearby health centers. Most importantly, the study will create awareness among the people and the authority about the snakebite which is considered as neglected tropical disease.

TI  - Overview of snakebite in Brazil: Possible drivers and a tool for risk mapping
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Snakebite envenoming affects close to 2.7 million people globally every year. In Brazil, snakebites are reported to the Ministry of Health surveillance system and cases receive antivenom free of charge. There is an urgent need to identify higher risk areas for antivenom distribution, and to develop prevention activities. The objective of this study is to provide an overview of the epidemiological situation of snakebite envenoming in Brazil and explore possible drivers; as well as to create a flowchart tool to support decision-makers identify higher risk areas. An ecological-type study was carried out using data by municipality (2013-2017). Study parts: 1) Create a geocoded database and perform a descriptive and cluster analysis; 2) Statistical analysis to measure the association of snakebite and possible environmental and socioeconomic drivers; 3) Develop a flowchart to support decision-makers and the application of this tool in one state (Rio Grande do Sul) as an example. An average of 27,120 snakebite cases per year were reported at the country level. Clusters of municipalities with high numbers of snakebites are mostly found in the Amazon Legal Region. The negative binomial regression model showed association with the snakebite case count: the type of major habitat, tropical or non-tropical; temperature; percentage of urbanization; precipitation; elevation; GDP per capita; a weaker relation with forest loss; and with venomous snake richness. The state where the instrument was applied reported 4,227 snakebites in the period. Most municipalities were considered as medium risk and 56/496 as high risk according to the tool created. Snakebite cases are distributed across the entire country with the highest concentration in the Legal Amazon Region. This creates a complex situation both for better understanding of the association of environmental and socioeconomic factors with snakebites and for the distribution and maintenance of antivenom to remote areas. Research into types of antivenom with a longer shelf life without the need for refrigeration is needed.

TI  - VSV-NJ on Ossabaw Island, Georgia - The truth is out there
T2  - TROPICAL VETERINARY DISEASES: CONTROL AND PREVENTION IN THE CONTEXT OF THE NEW WORLD ORDER
CP  - 5th Biennial Conference of the Society-for-Tropical-Veterinary-Medicine
AB  - Ossabaw Island, Georgia, is the only recognized enzootic focus of vesicular stomatitis virus New Jersey (VSV-NJ) in the United States and has been the subject of VSV-NJ research since 1981. To date, VSV-NJ antibodies have been detected only from feral swine, cattle, equines, deer, and raccoons. VSV-NJ transmission occurs annually, is seasonal, and is associated with the maritime forest. Despite high transmission rates the clinical disease is rarely detected. A sand fly (Lutzomyia shannoni) occurs on the Island, and experimental and field data suggest that it is a biological vector of VSV-NJ at this site. Many questions relating to the epidemiology of VSV-NJ on Ossabaw remain. What is the maintenance cycle of VSV-Nj? Is a vertebrate amplifying host(s) needed? Are other insect vectors involved in mechanical or biological transmission? Why do vesicular lesions develop on some but not all infected animals? Do native and domestic animals play the same role in the maintenance cycle? These questions challenge researchers in all areas where VSV-NJ occurs. It is our hope that Ossabaw Island will provide a much needed model system for gaining insight into the epidemiology of this virus.

TI  - Seed regeneration mechanisms over fine spatial scales on recovering Coffee plantation and pasture in Puerto Rico
T2  - PLANT ECOLOGY
AB  - Researchers have long been interested in the scale-dependence of ecological processes and, more recently, in the precise scale at which a process operates. Plant regeneration studies have also been interested in scale questions, but have not studied either several regeneration mechanisms at once or the exact scales they work at. To address these issues, I set out 256 seeds for each of four species in each of two 16 x 16 cell plastic grids placed on a 1 year old Coffee plantation and on a 4 year old pasture, both in Puerto Rico. I found that seed predation was the dominant mechanism (50%-75% losses among species) of seed mortality compared to seed disease (20%-45% losses); while germination accounted for 15%-35% of the seed. In general, species responded individualistically with no clear trends within coffee or pasture. I next used Ripleys K-function to investigate spatial-dependency over spatial scales ranging from 2 cm to 20 cm for each seed mechanism, each species and within each field type. Again the most recurrent patterns came from taking the seed mechanisms separately, compared to species or field type trends. I found that (1) seed predation clumped at scales of 2 cm to 11 cm, (2) clumping for seed disease was rare and scattered among scales, and (3) seeds germinated in a clumped pattern at scales of 11 cm to 23 cm. These results reflect the behavior of seed predators, and may also mimic the size of sun flecks, in disturbed areas of Puerto Rico. Finally, I discuss their implications for old-field microsite preferences, safe sites and patch dynamics.

TI  - One Health surveillance approaches for melioidosis and glanders: The Malaysian perspective
T2  - FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE
AB  - The One Health concept was initiated to promote the integration of human, animal, and environmental ecosystems into healthcare to ensure effective control and the sustainable governance of multifaceted health matters. Climate change, deforestation, and rigorous farming disrupt the environment, which serves as the natural habitat for many animals and microbes, increasing the likelihood of disease transmission between humans and animals. Melioidosis (neglected tropical diseases) and glanders are of humans and animals caused by the gram-negative bacteria Burkholderia pseudomallei and its close relative Burkholderia mallei, respectively. In Malaysia, although melioidosis is endemic, it is not a notifiable disease. Hence, the true prevalence of melioidosis in Malaysia is unknown and varies in different regions of the country, with reported hotspots associated with agriculture-related activities. To date, no incidence of human glanders has been reported in Malaysia, although occupational exposure for equine handlers and veterinary professionals remains a concern. Additionally, antibiotics are widely used in the healthcare and veterinary sectors to treat or prevent B. pseudomallei and B. mallei infections, leading to the emergence of resistance in B. pseudomallei. Lack of surveillance, research, assessment, and management of glanders and melioidosis is a major issue in Malaysia. Proper assessment systems and cross-discipline cooperation are vital to recognize and manage both diseases. Experts and practitioners from clinical and veterinary disciplines, environmentalists, law enforcement, policymakers, researchers, local communities, and other experts need to communicate, collaborate, and coordinate activities to fill the knowledge gap on glanders and melioidosis to reduce morbidity and mortality rates in the country. This review aims to define the organizational and functional characteristics of One Health surveillance approaches for glanders and melioidosis from a Malaysian perspective.

AB  - Plague, a life-threatening flea-borne zoonosis caused by Yersittia pesils, has most commonly been reported from eastern Africa and Madagascar in recent decades. in these regions and elsewhere, prevention and control efforts are typically targeted at fine spatial scales, yet risk maps for the disease are often presented at coarse spatial resolutions that are of limited value in allocating scarce prevention and control resources. In our study, we sought to identify sub-village level remotely sensed correlates of elevated risk of human exposure to plague bacteria and to project the model across the plague-endemic West Nile region of Uganda and into neighboring regions of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Our model yielded an overall accuracy of 81%, with sensitivities and specificities of 89% and 71%. respectively. Risk was higher above 1,300 meters than below, and the remotely sensed covariates that were included in the model implied that localities that are wetter, with less vegetative growth and more bare soil during the dry month of January (when agricultural plots are typically fallow) pose an increased risk of plague case occurrence. Our results suggest that environmental and landscape features play a large part in classifying an area as ecologically conducive to plague activity. However, it is clear that future studies aimed at identifying behavioral and fine-scale ecological risk factors in the West Nile region are required to fully assess the risk of human exposure to Y. pestis.

TI  - The Asian-Melanesian bambusicolous genus <i>Myriodiscus</i> is related to the genus <i>Tympanis</i>, the North American-European tree pathogen
T2  - FOREST PATHOLOGY
AB  - Species of Tympanis are well-known pathogens in Holarctic forests, but we know little about their relationship to other genera in Tympanidaceae. The genus Myriodiscus, remarkable macroscopically and a possible pathogen on bamboo, has a complicated taxonomic history and has not been conclusively placed phylogenetically. Species of Myriodiscus have been described under two other generic names, Ascotremellopsis and Gelatinomyces, the latter being related to the pathogenic genus Collophorina. There has been no formal synonymy of these three bambusicolous genera or agreement on their systematic positions. We combine accurate micromorphology and DNA sequence data to show the link between Tympanis and Myriodiscus and reveal previously unrecognized features of the latter. These two genera show a type of ascus development unique in the Leotiomycetes. With this new data, we have resolved past confusions over the identity of these fungi, determined their systematic position and have proposed the proper synonymies for Myriodiscus sparassoides and one new combination (M. conus).

TI  - Malaria transmission structure in the Peruvian Amazon through antibody signatures to <i>Plasmodium vivax</i>
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   The landscape of malaria transmission in the Peruvian Amazon is temporally and spatially heterogeneous, presenting different micro-geographies with particular epidemiologies. Most cases are asymptomatic and escape routine malaria surveillance based on light microscopy (LM). Following the implementation of control programs in this region, new approaches to stratify transmission and direct efforts at an individual and community level are needed. Antibody responses to serological exposure markers (SEM) to Plasmodium vivax have proven diagnostic performance to identify people exposed in the previous 9 months.
   Methodology
   We measured antibody responses against 8 SEM to identify recently exposed people and determine the transmission dynamics of P. vivax in peri-urban (Iquitos) and riverine (Maza ' n) communities of Loreto, communities that have seen significant recent reductions in malaria transmission. Socio-demographic, geo-reference, LM and qPCR diagnosis data were collected from two cross-sectional surveys. Spatial and multilevel analyses were implemented to describe the distribution of seropositive cases and the risk factors associated with exposure to P. vivax.
   Principal findings
   Low local transmission was detected by qPCR in both Iquitos (5.3%) and Maza ' n (2.7%); however, seroprevalence indicated a higher level of (past) exposure to P. vivax in Maza ' n (56.5%) than Iquitos (38.2%). Age and being male were factors associated with high odds of being seropositive in both sites. Higher antibody levels were found in individuals > 15 years old. The persistence of long-lived antibodies in these individuals could overestimate the detection of recent exposure. Antibody levels in younger populations (< 15 years old) could be a better indicator of recent exposure to P. vivax.
   Conclusions
   The large number of current and past infections detected by SEMs allows for detailed local epidemiological analyses, in contrast to data from qPCR prevalence surveys which did not produce statistically significant associations. Serological surveillance will be increasingly important in the Peruvian Amazon as malaria transmission is reduced by continued control and elimination efforts.

TI  - Biological invasions and the study of vertebrate dispersal of plants: Opportunities and integration
T2  - ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
AB  - Biological invasions are a key threat to natural ecosystems and consequently a major focus of ecological research. Even though it is dispersal processes that result in the movement of invasive populations through landscapes, dispersal ecology has played a relatively minor role in invasion ecology research. This is particularly true for vertebrate-dispersed plants. To encourage thinking around these issues and a greater involvement of dispersal ecologists in invasion research, we review contributions made to invasion ecology by dispersal ecology and highlight opportunities that the study of biological invasions offers for improving our understanding of dispersal processes. We suggest that by working in the context of invasions dispersal ecologists are not only able to contribute to the development of process-based management but also gain new opportunities for developing and testing predictions in their field. Because biological invasions are perturbations of natural systems they provide excellent opportunities for both natural and manipulative experimentation with potential for a range of forms of replication. Significantly, the need to develop a predictive understanding of population-level patterns of spread in order to manage invasives demands a shift away from studying individual vectors to developing predictions that integrate across all vectors and processes in the dispersal loop. This is a significant development for dispersal ecology and is a major opportunity for dispersal ecologists to contribute to a current environmental issue.

TI  - Habitat suitability mapping of <i>Anopheles darlingi</i> in the surroundings of the Manso hydropower plant reservoir, Mato Grosso, Central Brazil
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH GEOGRAPHICS
AB  - Background: Hydropower plants provide more than 78% of Brazil's electricity generation, but the country's reservoirs are potential new habitats for main vectors of malaria. In a case study in the surroundings of the Manso hydropower plant in Mato Grosso state, Central Brazil, habitat suitability of Anopheles darlingi was studied. Habitat profile was characterized by collecting environmental data. Remote sensing and GIS techniques were applied to extract additional spatial layers of land use, distance maps, and relief characteristics for spatial model building.
   Results: Logistic regression analysis and ROC curves indicate significant relationships between the environment and presence of An. darlingi. Probabilities of presence strongly vary as a function of land cover and distance from the lake shoreline. Vector presence was associated with spatial proximity to reservoir and semi-deciduous forests followed by Cerrado woodland. Vector absence was associated with open vegetation formations such as grasslands and agricultural areas. We suppose that non-significant differences of vector incidences between rainy and dry seasons are associated with the availability of anthropogenic breeding habitat of the reservoir throughout the year.
   Conclusion: Satellite image classification and multitemporal shoreline simulations through DEMbased GIS-analyses consist in a valuable tool for spatial modeling of A. darlingi habitats in the studied hydropower reservoir area. Vector presence is significantly increased in forested areas near reservoirs in bays protected from wind and wave action. Construction of new reservoirs under the tropical, sub-humid climatic conditions should therefore be accompanied by entomologic studies to predict the risk of malaria epidemics.

TI  - Coincident Tick Infestations in the Nostrils of Wild Chimpanzees and a Human in Uganda
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Ticks in the nostrils of humans visiting equatorial African forests have been reported sporadically for decades, but their taxonomy and natural history have remained obscure. We report human infestation with a nostril tick in Kibale National Park, Uganda, coincident with infestation of chimpanzees in the same location with nostril ticks, as shown by high-resolution digital photography. The human-derived nostril tick was identified morphologically and genetically as a nymph of the genus Amblyomma, but the mitochondrial 12S ribosomal RNA or the nuclear intergenic transcribed spacer 2 DNA sequences of the specimen were not represented in GenBank. These ticks may represent a previously uncharacterized species that is adapted to infesting chimpanzee nostrils as a defense against grooming. Ticks that feed upon apes and humans may facilitate cross-species transmission of pathogens, and the risk of exposure is likely elevated for persons who frequent ape habitats.

TI  - Identification of Tsetse (<i>Glossina</i> spp.) Using Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionisation Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Glossina (G.) spp. (Diptera: Glossinidae), known as tsetse flies, are vectors of African trypanosomes that cause sleeping sickness in humans and nagana in domestic livestock. Knowledge on tsetse distribution and accurate species identification help identify potential vector intervention sites. Morphological species identification of tsetse is challenging and sometimes not accurate. The matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI TOF MS) technique, already standardised for microbial identification, could become a standard method for tsetse fly diagnostics. Therefore, a unique spectra reference database was created for five lab-reared species of riverine-, savannah-and forest-type tsetse flies and incorporated with the commercial Biotyper 3.0 database. The standard formic acid/acetonitrile extraction of male and female whole insects and their body parts (head, thorax, abdomen, wings and legs) was used to obtain the flies' proteins. The computed composite correlation index and cluster analysis revealed the suitability of any tsetse body part for a rapid taxonomical identification. Phyloproteomic analysis revealed that the peak patterns of G. brevipalpis differed greatly from the other tsetse. This outcome was comparable to previous theories that they might be considered as a sister group to other tsetse spp. Freshly extracted samples were found to be matched at the species level. However, sex differentiation proved to be less reliable. Similarly processed samples of the common house fly Musca domestica (Diptera: Muscidae; strain: Lei) did not yield any match with the tsetse reference database. The inclusion of additional strains of morphologically defined wild caught flies of known origin and the availability of large-scale mass spectrometry data could facilitate rapid tsetse species identification in the future.

TI  - Environmental health impacts of east African Rift volcanism
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL GEOCHEMISTRY AND HEALTH
AB  - The East African Rift Valley (EARV) is a structure of a major order in the Earth's crust. Accompanying volcanic activity has influenced greatly the nature of the soils and the geochemistry of ground and surface waters, an influence that is reflected in water and food quality. Direct volcanic impacts result from the up-welling of volatile, potentially harmful elements (PHE), such as F, As, and Hg, that dissolve directly into groundwaters. Intense tropical weathering results in clear redistribution of all but the most refractory elements to form distinct zones of micronutrient deficiencies and PHE excesses. Of concern, too, is human exposure to volcanic materials such as dust and clay-enriched soil fractions. Further alteration of the landscape geochemistry is being brought about by pollution from human activities, with increasing health concerns in many ecosystems of the region. This review shows that the unique distribution pattern of trace elements, imprinted by the East African Rift volcanism and modified by weathering and anthropogenic factors, correlates with a number of geochemical diseases in man and animals. It is submitted that accurate diagnoses of these diseases and associated health conditions, and prescription of appropriate remedies, must be founded upon a fundamental understanding of how the elements were naturally distributed in the first place. This can only be realised through the construction of complete geochemical databases for the region.

TI  - Alien hotspot: Benthic marine species introduced in the Brazilian semiarid coast
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
AB  - In this study, we provide a baseline assessment of introduced marine species along the extensive (similar to 600 km) Brazilian semiarid coast. We reported 27 introduced and 26 cryptogenic species. Moreover, the main vectors of introduction were ballast water, shipping lines, oil and gas activities, biofouling, and rafting on plastic debris. The taxa were Ascidiacea (17 species) and Bryozoa (17), followed by Crustacea (6), Mollusca (6), Cnidaria (3), Echinodermata (3), and Porifera (1). Among these invertebrates, some species are recognized as drivers of impacts such as the invasive corals (Tubastraea tagusensis and Tubastraea coccinea), the bivalves Isognomom bicolor and Perna viridis, the crab Charybdis hellerii, the brittle star Ophiothela mirabilis, and, finally, the bryozoan Membraniporopsis tubigera. These species threaten the biodiversity of unique ecosystems such as intertidal sandstone reefs, shallow-water coral reefs, and mesophotic ecosystems. Moreover, the up-to-date results highlight that this region is a hotspot of bioinvasion in the tropical South Atlantic.

TI  - "Evolution Canyon," a potential microscale monitor of global warming across life
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
AB  - Climatic change and stress is a major driving force of evolution. The effects of climate change on living organisms have been shown primarily on regional and global scales. Here I propose the "Evolution Canyon" (EC) microscale model as a potential life monitor of global warming in Israel and the rest of the world. The EC model reveals evolution in action at a microscale involving biodiversity divergence, adaptation, and incipient sympatric speciation across life from viruses and bacteria through fungi, plants, and animals. The EC consists of two abutting slopes separated, on average, by 200 m. The tropical, xeric, savannoid, "African" south-facing slope (AS = SFS) abuts the forested "European" north-facing slope (ES = NFS). The AS receives 200-800% higher solar radiation than the ES. The ES represents the south European forested maquis. The AS and ES exhibit drought and shade stress, respectively. Major adaptations on the AS are because of solar radiation, heat, and drought, whereas those on the ES relate to light stress and photosynthesis. Preliminary evidence suggests the extinction of some European species on the ES and AS. In Drosophila, a 10-fold higher migration was recorded in 2003 from the AS to ES. I advance some predictions that could be followed in diverse species in EC. The EC microclimatic model is optimal to track global warming at a microscale across life from viruses and bacteria to mammals in Israel, and in additional ECs across the planet.

TI  - Mangrove Species Discrimination from Very High Resolution Imagery Using Gaussian Markov Random Field Model
T2  - WETLANDS
AB  - Mangrove forests are the most productive ecosystem for tropical and subtropical flora, but they are experiencing serious loss. Urgent measures should be taken for conservation and restoration, including investigation of mangrove species constitution using satellite imagery in which texture provides effective information. However, differentiation by texture for various species of mangroves is underexplored. The Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) has proved to be a common approach to describing texture in most previous studies, while other textural measurements such as the Gaussian Markov Random Field (GMRF) have seldom been tested and applied. This study aimed to provide a comprehensive assessment and comparison of textures using GLCM and GMRF to offer a better understanding of their roles in mangrove species discrimination using very high-resolution satellite data. The experiments were designed to highlight two aspects of textural features - local pattern and textured region size - to assess their effect on mangrove species discrimination based on texture definition. The results indicated that adjusting the textured region size can easily improve texture extraction, and GMRF outperformed GLCM in texture representation of mangrove forest using the same parameters, with an increase in overall accuracy (1.54%, 6.47% and 10.66% on average at three different local pattern sizes).

CP  - 1996 National Convention of the Society-of-American-Foresters
AB  - The cuachalalate tree is an important floral component of the tropical deciduous forest and one of the forestry specie with most traditional use in Mexico. His bark is utilized in several places of Mexico to cure about 30 differents diseases and Morelos is the only State supplying of bark. The traditional bark stripping is done without control, frecuently causing destruction of vitals tissues, injuring aproximately 250 trees by month, 80 percent of which die. By the other hand, the hexanic extract of the cuachalalate bark reduces level of cholesterol in blood until 34 percent(Mata et al 1991) and masticadienonic acid, to reduces stomach cancer(adenocarcinom) until 54 percent (Navarrete, 1986; Soriano et al 1987). Therefore, this research has as main objectives, to found techniques of bark stripping without destroying vitals tissues, to determine the regeneration capacity of bark, to determine if the second bark (regenerated bark) have the same concentration of active compounds, for a sostained production of bark, without destroyer this important resource.

TI  - Entomopathogenic Viruses in the Neotropics: Current Status and Recently Discovered Species
T2  - NEOTROPICAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - The market for biological control of insect pests in the world and in Brazil has grown in recent years due to the unwanted ecological and human health impacts of chemical insecticides. Therefore, research on biological control agents for pest management has also increased. For instance, insect viruses have been used to protect crops and forests around the world for decades. Among insect viruses, the baculoviruses are the most studied and used viral biocontrol agent. More than 700 species of insects have been found to be naturally infected by baculoviruses, with 90% isolated from lepidopteran insects. In this review, some basic aspects of baculovirus infection in vivo and in vitro infection, gene content, viral replication will be discussed. Furthermore, we provide examples of the use of insect viruses for biological pest control and recently characterized baculoviruses in Brazil.

TI  - GENUS ALPINIA, A POTENTIAL POWERHOUSE OF BIOACTIVE: A REVIEW
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES AND RESEARCH
AB  - Alpinia is the largest and most taxonomically complex genus in the Zingiberaceae family. This includes about 230 species and widely spread throughout forests in tropical and subtropical Asia. Many of species are herbs and rich sources of bioactive compounds that extensively used in various purposes ranging from its use in culinary, prevention of diseases and ornamental purposes. There is no reported systematic method to differentiate many of the species within the genus particularly species used in medicinal preparations except heavily used ones. Many species in this genus could have the potentials to be utilized commercially due to valuable phytochemicals but never subjected to any kind of systematic study. Therefore, a proper morphological and physicochemical identification is a must to maintain sustainable exploration of many species of the genera. This review focuses on gathering information regarding genus Alpinia including morphological characteristics, phytochemicals, and their biological activities which provide information for further advance research work.

TI  - Screening disease resistance of <i>Acacia auriculiformis</i> clones against <i>Ceratocystis manginecans</i> by artificial and natural inoculation methods
T2  - AUSTRALASIAN PLANT PATHOLOGY
AB  - Tropical species of Acacia are grown in plantations for pulpwood in many countries of South-east Asia. A vascular wilt disease caused by Ceratocystis manginecans is compromising their productivity and continued use as a commercial species and has become an issue in Vietnam. In this study, we evaluated the potential resistance of 45 three-year-old Acacia auriculiformis clones to C. manginecans using different pathogenicity tests: natural infection in the field, natural infection in the field promoted by artificial wounding, and the inoculation of excised branch segments in a controlled environment. Ten of the 45 clones expressed disease symptoms in the field under natural infection conditions; mean percentage of infection varied from 3.5 to 21.7%. Although the screening protocols of artificial wounding in the field to promote natural infection and excised branch segment inoculations led to a greater number of clones being infected, respectively 22 and 38, there were significant correlations between the percentage of infected trees, disease index and lesion length (L) following natural infection and each of these protocols. There were no significant differences in L between the top 15 most tolerant clones following excised branch segment inoculations. Seven clones (AA78, AA83, AA89, AA92, AA93, AA95 and AA103) were resistant (L = 0.0) with MAIs of >20 m(3)/ha/y. This finding suggests that there may be opportunities to employ resistant clones in breeding programs and to increase disease tolerance to C. manginecans in A. auriculiformis and Acacia hybrid (A. mangium x A. auriculiformis) through genetic gain.

AB  - The illegal timber trade has significant impact on the survival of endangered tropical hardwood species like Dalbergia spp. (rosewood), a world-wide protected genus from the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). Due to increased threat to Dalbergia spp., and lack of action to reduce threats, port of entry analysis methods are required to identify Dalbergia spp. Handheld laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) has been shown to be capable of identifying species and establishing provenance of Dalbergia spp. and other tropical hardwoods, but analysis methods for this work have yet to be investigated in detail. The present work investigates five well-known algorithms-partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), classification and regression trees (CART), k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM)-two training/test set sampling regimes, and data collection at two signal-to-noise (S/N) ratios to assess the potential for handheld LIBS analyses. Additionally, imbalanced classes are addressed. For this application, SVM and RF yield near identical results (though RF takes nearly 100 longer to compute), while the S/N ratio has a significant effect on model success assuming all else is equal. It was found that forming a training set with replicate low S/N analyses can perform as well as higher precision training sets for true prediction, even if the predicted samples have low signal to noise! This work confirms handheld LIBS analyzers can provide a viable method for classification of hardwood species, even within the same genus.

TI  - Snakebite Envenoming in French Guiana
T2  - ANNALES FRANCAISES DE MEDECINE D URGENCE
AB  - Snakebite envenoming is a globally neglected disease with significant mortality and morbidity rates. Our goal is to report data from the recent literature on the epidemiology and management of snakebites envenoming in French Guiana. French Guiana is an overseas French region almost entirely covered by a tropical forest. It shelters a very rich herpeto-fauna including in particular species of Bothrops (Viperidae) which cause the greatest number of bites and envenoming. The management of snakebites envenoming is challenging the public health system. Indeed, most envenoming occur in remote rural areas where access to healthcare is complicated with a medical staff poorly trained and the unavailability of anti-venom which constitutes a real loss of chance. Finally, in the context of global efforts to reduce the impact of snakebites envenoming, international cooperation with the commitment of local health authorities and civil society is required. In French Guiana, the implementation of a care strategy and the provision of antivenom in the most remote health structures would be real progress.

TI  - Population Genomics Reveals Incipient Speciation, Introgression, and Adaptation in the African Mona Monkey (<i>Cercopithecus mona</i>)
T2  - MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB  - Guenons (tribe Cercopithecini) are the most widely distributed nonhuman primate in the tropical forest belt of Africa and show considerable phenotypic, taxonomic, and ecological diversity. However, genomic information for most species within this group is still lacking. Here, we present a high-quality de novo genome (total 2.90 Gb, contig N50 equal to 22.7 Mb) of the mona monkey (Cercopithecus mona), together with genome resequencing data of 13 individuals sampled across Nigeria. Our results showed differentiation between populations from East and West of the Niger River similar to 84 ka and potential ancient introgression in the East population from other mona group species. The PTPRK, FRAS1, BNC2, and EDN3 genes related to pigmentation displayed signals of introgression in the East population. Genomic scans suggest that immunity genes such as AKT3 and IL13 (possibly involved in simian immunodeficiency virus defense), and G6PD, a gene involved in malaria resistance, are under positive natural selection. Our study gives insights into differentiation, natural selection, and introgression in guenons.

TI  - ANTIVIRAL ACTIVITY OF PANAMANIAN PLANT-EXTRACTS
T2  - PHYTOTHERAPY RESEARCH
AB  - Panamanian tropical forest plants are potential sources of useful medicinal compounds including some with antiviral activities.  Extracts prepared from the leaves of seven plants (Alseis blackiana Hemsl., Aspidosperma megalocarpon Muell, Arg., Hybanthus prunifolius (Humb. & Bonpl.) G. K. Schulze, Ouratea lucens Engl., Piper cordulatum C. DC., Trichilia cipo C. DC. and Tetragastris panamensis Kuntze) were screened for antiviral activity using three separate assay methods.  The more polar (aqueous and ethanol) extracts of all plants demonstrated antiviral and virucidal activities.  Good activities were found in the Ouratea lucens and Trichilia cipo ethanol and aqueous extracts which were further characterized for antiviral activity and cytotoxic effects.  These extracts had direct virucidal activity as well as intracellular antiviral activity against both DNA and RNA viruses.  Antiviral activity was achieved with extract concentrations significantly lower than those necessary to produce cytotoxic effects.  Additionally, extracts were less toxic to normal cells than to the tumour cells tested.

TI  - A Recent Outbreak of the Hawaiian Koa Moth, <i>Scotorythra paludicola</i> (Lepidoptera: Geometridae), and a Review of Outbreaks between 1892 and 2003
T2  - PACIFIC SCIENCE
AB  - The koa moth, Scotorythra paludicola, is in endemic Hawaiian moth that undergoes sporadic Outbreaks In koa forests in Hawai'i, causing vast defoliations of its host plant, Acacia koa. We studied one such Outbreak that occurred on Fast Maul in 2003, in which approximately 16 km(2) of forest were defoliated. We collected adult Moths and larvae, and recorded size-class distribution Of larvae in defoliated regions. Larvae at a given site tended to be of a similar size Class, Suggesting that Outbreaks were synchronous, and mean development tune from first instar to adulthood was 42 days under laboratory, conditions. Mortality of field-collected, laboratory-reared larvae due to disease was high (80%)), making it impossible to quantify meaningful parasitism rates, but three non-native hymenopteran primary parasitoids were reared (the braconids Meteorus laphygmae and Cotesia marginiventris, and the ichneumonid Hyposoter exiguae). One ichneumonid hyperparasitoid, Gelis sp., was also reared. No native parasitoids were reared. We found no relationship between occurrence of five koa moth Outbreaks on East Main between 1920 and 2006 and annual or monthly precipitation or temperature during that period.

TI  - Diarists, Scientists, Imperialists and the Management of the Environment in the American Pacific, 1899-1902
T2  - JOURNAL OF PACIFIC HISTORY
AB  - They say first impressions always matter. Americans acquired an empire of tropical islands in the Pacific about which they knew little and cared even less. Yet they set to almost immediately to understand and harness these new environments for their own purposes. This paper looks at the processes through which these strange new worlds in the Philippines and Guam were incorporated and subordinated into a comprehensible imperial framework through the diaries of two environmental managers, Gifford Pinchot and William Safford. Both men wrote about their first encounters with the tropics, recording its strange flora and fauna, noting its seismic convulsions and climatic extremes, and trying to manage it by making sense of what they saw, heard, smelt and touched. As diarists, scientists and, above all, imperialists, they give us rare insight into the initial attitudes of the men who managed these new imperial landscapes.

TI  - Cholera past and future in Nigeria: Are the Global Task Force on Cholera Control's 2030 targets achievable?
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Author summaryUsing a random forest model and future scenarios to project cholera risk, we assessed the achievability of the Global Task Force for Cholera Control 2030 Roadmap in Nigeria, based on sustainable development and environmental protection. The results highlighted how regional inequities within Nigeria will likely prevent the 2030 targets being reached. The northern states in Nigeria are more rural, less developed and have greater levels of insecurity and conflict. Reaching the levels of peace and development achieved in the south at a national level, along with improving urban planning and access and incentives to cholera testing, will be fundamental in reaching the Roadmap targets in Nigeria. Cholera predictions and projections are understudied and here we present the most in-depth projections currently produced for Nigeria. Projections provide a snapshot of potential future conditions and show what is needed going forward to meet and exceed health targets and reduce disease burden. We highlight how quantitative research can be used to inform policy and the relevance of doing so. Quantitative research should fundamentally aim to improve global health and by presenting our work with a strong policy focus, we highlight the relevance and importance of doing so.
   BackgroundUnderstanding and continually assessing the achievability of global health targets is key to reducing disease burden and mortality. The Global Task Force on Cholera Control (GTFCC) Roadmap aims to reduce cholera deaths by 90% and eliminate the disease in twenty countries by 2030. The Roadmap has three axes focusing on reporting, response and coordination. Here, we assess the achievability of the GTFCC targets in Nigeria and identify where the three axes could be strengthened to reach and exceed these goals. Methodology/Principal findingsUsing cholera surveillance data from Nigeria, cholera incidence was calculated and used to model time-varying reproduction number (R). A best fit random forest model was identified using R as the outcome variable and several environmental and social covariates were considered in the model, using random forest variable importance and correlation clustering. Future scenarios were created (based on varying degrees of socioeconomic development and emission reductions) and used to project future cholera transmission, nationally and sub-nationally to 2070. The projections suggest that significant reductions in cholera cases could be achieved by 2030, particularly in the more developed southern states, but increases in cases remain a possibility. Meeting the 2030 target, nationally, currently looks unlikely and we propose a new 2050 target focusing on reducing regional inequities, while still advocating for cholera elimination being achieved as soon as possible. Conclusion/SignificanceThe 2030 targets could potentially be reached by 2030 in some parts of Nigeria, but more effort is needed to reach these targets at a national level, particularly through access and incentives to cholera testing, sanitation expansion, poverty alleviation and urban planning. The results highlight the importance of and how modelling studies can be used to inform cholera policy and the potential for this to be applied in other contexts.

TI  - Comprehensive Review of Endophytic Flora from African Medicinal Plants
T2  - CURRENT MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Many people in different African countries are suffering from different diseases many of which result in serious life threat and public health problems with high risk of infection and mortality. Due to less accessibility and high cost of modern drugs, people of this continent often depend on traditional medicine using medicinal plants to manage the diseases. Africa has large tropical rain forests, which are very rich in medicinal plants. Many of them have been scientifically proven for their medicinal values. These medicinal plants which constitute a large repertoire of endophytes have not been significantly explored for the isolation of these microorganisms and their bioactive secondary metabolites. This review summarizes the research on endophytes isolated from medicinal plants of Africa, their pharmacological potential and some of their biotechnological aspects. Novel compounds reported from endophytes from Africa with their biological activities have also been reviewed. Information documented in this review might serve as starting point for future researches on endophytes in different African countries.

TI  - High-resolution benthic habitat mapping from machine learning on PlanetScope imagery and ICESat-2 data
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
AB  - This study proposed a comprehensive approach that utilized PlanetScope imagery for classifying tropical-marine benthic habitats after retrieving bathymetry from ICESat-2 data and water-column correction for areas around Lyson Islands, Vietnam. Exact bathymetry derivation and water column correction were applied to the PlanetScope imagery, making it an effective method for mapping marine benthic habitats. Water column correction was achieved by applying Depth Invariant Index (DII) and Bottom Reflectance Index (BRI). Moreover, two conventional machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest and Support Vector Machine, and a current deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was employed to classify the benthic features. The overall accuracy of these classifiers are 80.74%, 84.19%, and 89.80% with the BRI, 80.17%, 82.75%, and 87.85% with the DII compared to 37.64%, 42.5%, and 47.2% of without corrected water columns respectively. The CNN model demonstrated that the approach significantly maximizes the improvement in benthic classification results in coastal region.

TI  - How Do Rural Households Cope with Economic Shocks? Insights from Global Data using Hierarchical Analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Unanticipated events can cause considerable economic hardship for poor rural households. Some types of negative shocks, for example weather-related agricultural losses and vector-borne diseases, are expected to occur more frequently as a result of climate change. In this paper we measure the role of household- and location-specific characteristics in conditioning behavioural responses to a wide range of idiosyncratic and covariate shocks. We use data from 8,000 rural households in 25 developing countries, compiled in the global database of the Poverty Environment Network. We employ a hierarchical multinomial logit model to identify the importance of characteristics observed at different levels of aggregation on a set of strategies aimed at coping with economic shocks. Results indicate that in response to idiosyncratic shocks, households tend to deplete financial and durable assets, whereas covariate and thus often climate-related shocks predominantly result in reduced consumption. Households in sites characterised by high asset wealth tend to cope with shocks in a more proactive way than those in sites with average or below average asset wealth, but the role of asset types in conditioning shock responses varies across regions. Our findings have implications for rural development and climate change adaptation strategies.

T2  - TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - The emergence of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) in the Himalayan highlands is of significant veterinary and public health concern and may be related to climate warming and anthropogenic landscape change, or simply improved surveillance. To investigate this phenomenon, a One Health approach focusing on the phylogeography of JEV, the distribution and abundance of the mosquito vectors, and seroprevalence in humans and animal reservoirs would be useful to understand the epidemiology of Japanese encephalitis in highland areas.

TI  - Infection dynamics of Sin Nombre virus after a widespread decline in host populations
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Many researchers have speculated that infection dynamics of Sin Nombre virus are driven by density patterns of its major host, Peromyscus maniculatus. Few, if any. studies have examined this question systematically at 11 realistically large spatial scale. however. We collected data from 1,59 independent field sites within a 1 million-hectare study area in Nevada and California, from 1995-1998. In 1997. there was a widespread and substantial reduction in host density. This reduction in host density did not reduce seroprevalence of antibody to Sin Nombre virus within host populations. During this period. however. there was a significant reduction in the likelihood that antibody-positive mice had detectable virus in their blood, as determined by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Our findings suggest 2 possible causal mechanisms for this reduction: an apparent change in the age structure of host populations and landscape-scale patterns of host density. This study indicates that a relationship does exist between host density and infection dynamics and that this relationship concurrently operates at different spatial scales. It also highlights the limitations of antibody seroprevalence as a metric of infections. especially during, transient host-density fluctuations.

TI  - Ecoregional classification of malaria vectors in the neotropics
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - An ecoregional approach to the classification of malaria in the neotropics region can give health personnel a new prespective on how to manage malaria control programs. We propose an ecoregional classification based on vector distribution and important environmental determinants, including vegetation type, rainfall patterns, mean temperatures, elevation, and geomorphology: The following 5 ecoregions are described: (1) coastal, (2) piedmont, (3) savanna, (4) interior lowland forest, and (5) high valley. Subregional differences are classified when appropriate. Because human activities and extensive changes in land use usually leads to increased human-vector contact and alter local vector distribution and abundance, it is important that these changes be considered in the classification of vector ecoregions. Using this approach, risk areas can be classified as to the presence and potential abundance of particular vectors. Then, in combination with other components of malaria transmission (e.g., migration, cultural practices, living conditions), areas for surveillance and intervention can be prioritized. It is hoped that this forum will be a catalyst for discussion, future research, and the development of ecologically orientated malaria control programs.

TI  - Cat rabies in Brazil: a growing One Health concern
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - This review of human and cat rabies from 1986 to 2022 has shown mostly AgV3 variant in human cases with 29/45 (64.4%) reports including 23 from bats, four from cats, and two from unknown species, followed by 8/45 (17.8%) of AgV2 variant (all from dogs), 4/45 from marmoset variant (all from Callithrix jacchus), 2/45 samples compatible with wild canid variant (both from Cerdocyon thous), and one/45 of AgV1 variant from a domestic dog. Only one sample of human rabies was not typified, related to bat aggression. In addition, surveillance conducted in the state of Sao Paulo confirmed the presence of rabies in 7/23,839 cats (0.031%) and 3/106,637 dogs (0.003%) between 2003 and 2013, with a 10:1 overall cat-to-dog positivity ratio. This 10-fold higher infection rate for cat rabies may be explained by cats' hunting habits and predation. In addition, after 28 years of rabies-free status, a new cat rabies case was reported in the city of Sao Paulo in 2011. The rabid cat lived, along with other pets, in a household located near the largest downtown city park, whose owners presented animal hoarding behavior. Thus, animal hoarders and rescuers, public health agents, animal health professionals, and the general population with contact need to be aware of the risk of bat-borne rabies followed by spillover from cats to humans. In conclusion, cat rabies cases are becoming increasingly important in Brazil. This poses a One Health concern, given the overlapping of human, bat and cat populations within the same predisposed environment.

TI  - Diversity and recent population trends of assassin bugs (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) on Barro Colorado Island, Panama
T2  - INSECT CONSERVATION AND DIVERSITY
AB  - 1. In tropical rainforests, most assassin bugs (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) represent important predators preying on other arthropods. Apart from the hematophagous Triatominae of medical importance, Reduviidae remain poorly known.
   2. Here, we address the importance of Reduviidae for long-term monitoring of secondary consumers in tropical rainforests, using data from Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama. First, we demonstrate that light traps allow catching a wide and representative diversity of Reduviidae, and are more efficient than other collection methods tested.
   3. Second, we present one of the very first checklists of Reduviidae for a tropical locality, including 118 species. These baseline data will be necessary for interpreting any long-term changes in reduviid populations on BCI.
   4. Last, we show that the low abundance of Reduviidae collected at light remains challenging for statistical analyses of long-term population trends. During a 7-year period (2009-2015), we observed no significant changes in the short-term population dynamics of most reduviid taxa, although these results do not account for the complexity of the intra-annual population dynamics of each species. In particular, the population of the rather abundant Panstrongylus geniculatus, which is a known vector of Chagas' disease, appears to be fluctuating but so far is stable.
   5. Daily maximum temperature and rainfall were negatively correlated with the overall abundance of Reduviidae during light traps surveys. During the past 25 years, global warming has induced significant increases in annual temperature and rainfall in Panama. Therefore, we conclude that reduviid populations on BCI may be vulnerable in the future to these global effects.

TI  - Evaluation of dazomet as fumigant for the control of brown root rot disease
T2  - PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE
AB  - BACKGROUND: Brown root rot disease caused by Phellinus noxius is widespread in approximately 216 tree and plant species in tropical and subtropical countries. No direct means of protection against P. noxius infection have thus far been developed. Therefore, in this field survey, a method was developed for preventing and controlling brown root rot disease using fumigation with dazomet. RESULTS: Tracers were used to monitor the effect of dazomet fumigation. The results from field surveys and phytotoxicity tests showed that dazomet is able to kill P. noxius without any side effects on plants. CONCLUSION: The use of an environmentally friendly agent to control brown root rot disease is needed, and prevention of the disease is more important than treatment. Hence, chemical fumigation with 60 g m-2 of 98% dazomet may be a possible means of preventing P. noxius incursion in agriculture, gardening and agroforestry.

TI  - Morbidity and mortality disparities among colonist and indigenous populations in the Ecuadorian Amazon
T2  - SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE
AB  - Rural populations living in the northern Ecuadorian Amazon (NEA) experience the highest health burden of any region in the country. Two independent studies of colonist and indigenous groups living in the NEA are used to compare their morbidity and mortality experiences. Colonist data are from a probability sample of land plots in 1999, while indigenous data are from a representative sample of the five largest ethnicities (Quichua. Shuar, Huaorani, Cofan, Secoya) collected in 2001. Poisson regression was used to compare morbidity. Results indicate clear differences in health between populations. Indigenous groups had 30% higher probability of mortality and 63% higher incidence rate of all-cause morbidity compared to colonists. Vector-borne, chronic, gastrointestinal, and diseases of unknown origin were particularly high among indigenous groups. Factors associated with morbidity varied: morbidity rates were similar for the two youngest age groups (0-4 and 5-9), but indigenous people aged 15-39 and 40+ had almost double the morbidity compared to colonists; larger households, later months of data collection and less pollution were associated with less morbidity in both groups; better infrastructure access (electricity and roads) was generally associated with lower morbidity in both groups; and associations of land use were different by group with more cultivation of perennials and fewer annuals associated with less morbidity for colonists, but more for indigenous groups. These results demonstrate the health disparities that exist among indigenous and non-indigenous populations even when living in the same geographic region. Land use itself exemplifies the cultural and contextual differences that are evident in health, since land use decisions are related to broader demographic and economic factors that influence overall ecological and human health. Ongoing population-environment and/or environment-health research needs to recognize the broader factors involved when studying relationships between population health, development and deforestation.

TI  - Growth performance of <i>Falcataria moluccana</i> in the mixed cropping pattern and its severity from Gall-rust disease: A case study in Ciamis, West Java
T2  - INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON FOREST CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT (ICFCM) 2019: INNOVATIVE SOLUTION FOR MANAGING TROPICAL FORESTS AND CONSERVING BIODIVERSITY TO SUPPORT SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS
CP  - International Conference on Forest Conservation and Management (ICFCM)
AB  - Monoculture Falcataria moluccana plantation managed by local communities in Ciamis - West Java, is facing a gall-rust disease caused by fungal pathogen Uromycladium tepperianum. A mixed planting crops system is considered less vulnerable to pests and disease problems. In addition, it is possible to increase the productivity of community forest plantations. This study was aimed to evaluate the effects of mixed-crops plantation on the productivity of F. moluccana and the incidence and severity of gall-rust in the plantation. Then it will be compared to the existed monoculture F. moluccana plantation in the area, that was established two years before. The mixed-crop consisted of F. moluccana, Acacia mangium, and Gmelina arborea. These were alternately planted in three different rows with three replications. The observations of growth increments as well as incidence and severity of gallrust were carried out in 1.5 years after planting. The results showed that the annual height- and diameter- increments of F. moluccana in the mixed-crop plot were 331.2 cm and 2.77 cm, respectively. Meanwhile, the results in the monoculture plot were 325.62 cm and 2.64 cm. The survival rates of F. moluccana in both planting patterns were slightly different (85.3% and 88%). Gall-rust incidence and severity were only observed in the F. moluccana monoculture plot, i.e., 0.15% and 0.48%, respectively. The mixed-planting crops system seems possible to be applied for controlling the gall-rust disease that attacked the F. moluccana stands Further research on comparing the similar ages of mono- and mixed- cultures of F. moluccana in different locations were suggested.

TI  - The Challenge of Retarding Erosion of Island Biodiversity through Phytosanitary Measures: An Update on the Case of <i>Puccinia psidii</i> in Hawai'i
T2  - PACIFIC SCIENCE
AB  - Most rust fungi are highly host specific, but Puccina psidii has an extremely broad host range within Myrtaceae and gained notoriety with a host jump in its native Brazil from common guava (Psidium guajava) to commercial Eucalyptus plantations. When detected in Hawai'i in April 2005, the first invasion outside the neotropics/subtropics, there was immediate concern for 'ohia (Metrosideros polymorpha). 'Ohi'a composes 80% of native forest statewide, providing stable watersheds and habitat for most Hawaiian forest birds and plants. Within months, rust spores spread statewide on wind currents, but 'ohi'a was found to be only a minor host, showing very light damage. The primary host was nonnative rose apple (Syzygium jambos), severely affected at a landscape scale, but the epiphytotic subsided as rose apple was largely defoliated or killed within several years. The limited and stable host range in Hawai'i (versus elsewhere) led the local conservation community to explore possibilities for excluding new genetic strains of P. psidii. Although national/international phytosanitary standards require strong scientific justification for regulations involving an intraspecific taxonomic level, hopes were buoyed when genetic studies showed no apparent genetic variation/evolution in Hawai'i's rust strain. A sophisticated genetic study of P. psidii in its home range is near completion; genetic variation is substantial, and host species strongly influences rust population structure. To prevent introduction of new strains, the Hawai'i Department of Agriculture is moving ahead with establishing stringent measures that restrict entry of :Myrtaceae into Hawai'i. Meanwhile, P. psidii poses a major threat to Myrtaceae biodiversity worldwide.

TI  - Spatial Heterogeneity of Habitat Suitability for Rift Valley Fever Occurrence in Tanzania: An Ecological Niche Modelling Approach
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   Despite the long history of Rift Valley fever (RVF) in Tanzania, extent of its suitable habitat in the country remains unclear. In this study we investigated potential effects of temperature, precipitation, elevation, soil type, livestock density, rainfall pattern, proximity to wild animals, protected areas and forest on the habitat suitability for RVF occurrence in Tanzania.
   Materials and Methods
   Presence-only records of 193 RVF outbreak locations from 1930 to 2007 together with potential predictor variables were used to model and map the suitable habitats for RVF occurrence using ecological niche modelling. Ground-truthing of the model outputs was conducted by comparing the levels of RVF virus specific antibodies in cattle, sheep and goats sampled from locations in Tanzania that presented different predicted habitat suitability values.
   Principal Findings
   Habitat suitability values for RVF occurrence were higher in the northern and central-eastern regions of Tanzania than the rest of the regions in the country. Soil type and precipitation of the wettest quarter contributed equally to habitat suitability (32.4% each), followed by livestock density (25.9%) and rainfall pattern (9.3%). Ground-truthing of model outputs revealed that the odds of an animal being seropositive for RVFV when sampled from areas predicted to be most suitable for RVF occurrence were twice the odds of an animal sampled from areas least suitable for RVF occurrence (95% CI: 1.43, 2.76, p < 0.001).
   Conclusion/Significance
   The regions in the northernand central-eastern Tanzania were more suitable for RVF occurrence than the rest of the regions in the country. The modelled suitable habitat is characterised by impermeable soils, moderate precipitation in the wettest quarter, high livestock density and a bimodal rainfall pattern. The findings of this study should provide guidance for the design of appropriate RVF surveillance, prevention and control strategies which target areas with these characteristics.

A1  - Peru Influenza Working Grp
TI  - Changes in the Viral Distribution Pattern after the Appearance of the Novel Influenza A H1N1 (pH1N1) Virus in Influenza-Like Illness Patients in Peru
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Background: We describe the temporal variation in viral agents detected in influenza like illness (ILI) patients before and after the appearance of the ongoing pandemic influenza A (H1N1) (pH1N1) in Peru between 4-January and 13-July 2009.
   Methods: At the health centers, one oropharyngeal swab was obtained for viral isolation. From epidemiological week (EW) 1 to 18, at the US Naval Medical Research Center Detachment (NMRCD) in Lima, the specimens were inoculated into four cell lines for virus isolation. In addition, from EW 19 to 28, the specimens were also analyzed by real time-polymerase-chain-reaction (rRT-PCR).
   Results: We enrolled 2,872 patients: 1,422 cases before the appearance of the pH1N1 virus, and 1,450 during the pandemic. Non-pH1N1 influenza A virus was the predominant viral strain circulating in Peru through (EW) 18, representing 57.8% of the confirmed cases; however, this predominance shifted to pH1N1 (51.5%) from EW 19-28. During this study period, most of pH1N1 cases were diagnosed in the capital city (Lima) followed by other cities including Cusco and Trujillo. In contrast, novel influenza cases were essentially absent in the tropical rain forest (jungle) cities during our study period. The city of Iquitos (Jungle) had the highest number of influenza B cases and only one pH1N1 case.
   Conclusions: The viral distribution in Peru changed upon the introduction of the pH1N1 virus compared to previous months. Although influenza A viruses continue to be the predominant viral pathogen, the pH1N1 virus predominated over the other influenza A viruses.

TI  - Variable bites and dynamic populations; new insights in <i>Leishmania</i> transmission
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease which kills an estimated 50,000 people each year, with its deadly impact confined mainly to lower to middle income countries. Leishmania parasites are transmitted to human hosts by sand fly vectors during blood feeding. Recent experimental work shows that transmission is modulated by the patchy landscape of infection in the host's skin, and the parasite population dynamics within the vector. Here we assimilate these new findings into a simple probabilistic model for disease transmission which replicates recent experimental results, and assesses their relative importance. The results of subsequent simulations, describing random parasite uptake and dynamics across multiple blood meals, show that skin heterogeneity is important for transmission by short-lived flies, but that for longer-lived flies with multiple bites the population dynamics within the vector dominate transmission probability. Our results indicate that efforts to reduce fly lifespan beneath a threshold of around two weeks may be especially helpful in reducing disease transmission.
   Author summary
   Two recent discoveries hold particularly important ramifications for Leishmania transmission. First, parasites are heterogeneously distributed within the skin of an infected host. Second, the discovery of a new lifecycle stage known as the retroleptomonad promastigote changes the within-vector parasite dynamics. It is not yet known how these newly identified factors may interact to influence transmission. In this study, we design a tractable model for parasite population dynamics in the sand fly vector that consolidates these new results into a single system. We first demonstrate that our model can replicate established experimental results. We then interrogate this model, both analytically and numerically, to draw conclusions about Leishmania transmission in an ecological and epidemiological context. We conclude that the relative importance of the two focal factors depends critically on sand fly lifespan. In short-lived sand flies the heterogeneity in the number of parasites initially taken up by a sand fly is typically the crucial factor in Leishmania transmission, whereas for longer-lived sand flies the retroleptomonad lifecycle stage is likely to drive transmission. In a practical context these results suggest that minimising the expected sand fly lifespan could be an effective strategy to reduce Leishmania transmission.

TI  - STRUCTURE-BASED VIRTUAL SCREENING OF INDONESIAN NATURAL PRODUCT COMPOUNDS AS EBOLA VIRUS VP30 PROTEIN INHIBITORS
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOMATE
AB  - Indonesia has the second-highest biodiversity in the world. At least 9,600 out of 30,000 plant species exist in Indonesian tropical forests known to have medicinal properties. Hence lots of potentials still need to be explored including their abilities as an antiviral agent. Ebola virus (EBOV) continues as a major health threat worldwide with currently neither effective vaccine nor drug available. VP30 is one of the most important proteins for viral transcription activator of EBOV. Therefore, inhibiting this protein can be a viable choice for disturbing the life cycle of this virus. In this research, about 3,429 Indonesian natural product compounds were subjected into computational ADMET test using DataWarrior v4.7.2, while the molecular interaction and Gibbs free binding energy (Delta G(rinding)) value of the selected compounds were analyzed and calculated using MOE 2014.09 software. Finally, the oral bioavailability of the selected compounds was predicted using SwissADME software. Through this study, two compounds were selected to be potential VP30 inhibitors due to low Delta G(rinding) value. They were acrylamide C and scoulerine, which have Delta G(rinding) value of -9.7940 kcal/mol, and -7.3823 kcal/mol, respectively. Moreover, these two compounds did not possess any toxicity properties, and have high oral bioavailability, suggested it could highly be absorbed in the human body through oral administration. Thus, these compounds should be liable to be selected as the drug candidate of EBOV targeting VP30 and analyzed its antiviral activities further through molecular dynamics simulation and in vitro experiment.

CP  - 11th International Conference on Advanced Computer Science and Information Systems (ICACSIS)
AB  - Data of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are still limited. More data of PPIs are required so one can find significant proteins representing a disease more accurately. Computational approach which can predict PPIs is one of alternatives to reduce time and cost that generally required by experimental work. This research focused on predicting PPIs of Type 2 Diabetes mellitus using feedforward neural network (FNN). Impact of different activation functions, number of units per hidden layers and number of hidden layers themselves to estimation error were observed. Rectifier activation function, seven hidden layers and 36 units per hidden layers gave smallest MSE separately. The model with those configurations predicted a PPI with predicted combined score of 0.922. FNN model had better prediction accuracy than random forest and support vector regression models.

TI  - Assessing the risk of dengue severity using demographic information and laboratory test results with machine learning
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   Dengue virus causes a wide spectrum of disease, which ranges from subclinical disease to severe dengue shock syndrome. However, estimating the risk of severe outcomes using clinical presentation or laboratory test results for rapid patient triage remains a challenge. Here, we aimed to develop prognostic models for severe dengue using machine learning, according to demographic information and clinical laboratory data of patients with dengue.
   Methodology/Principal findings
   Out of 1,581 patients in the National Cheng Kung University Hospital with suspected dengue infections and subjected to NS1 antigen, IgM and IgG, and qRT-PCR tests, 798 patients including 138 severe cases were enrolled in the study. The primary target outcome was severe dengue. Machine learning models were trained and tested using the patient dataset that included demographic information and qualitative laboratory test results collected on day 1 when they sought medical advice. To develop prognostic models, we applied various machine learning methods, including logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting machine, support vector classifier, and artificial neural network, and compared the performance of the methods. The artificial neural network showed the highest average discrimination area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.8324 +/- 0.0268) and balance accuracy (0.7523 +/- 0.0273). According to the model explainer that analyzed the contributions/co-contributions of the different factors, patient age and dengue NS1 antigenemia were the two most important risk factors associated with severe dengue. Additionally, co-existence of anti-dengue IgM and IgG in patients with dengue increased the probability of severe dengue.
   Conclusions/Significance
   We developed prognostic models for the prediction of dengue severity in patients, using machine learning. The discriminative ability of the artificial neural network exhibited good performance for severe dengue prognosis. This model could help clinicians obtain a rapid prognosis during dengue outbreaks. However, the model requires further validation using external cohorts in future studies.
   Author summary
   Dengue virus infects millions of people annually and is associated with a high mortality rate. When outbreaks occur, hospitals are often overcrowded with patients. Thus, novel approaches are required to accelerate patient triage for hospitalization, or further intensive care. Machine learning is being widely applied for resolving various problems, including medical diagnosis and outcome prediction. Here, we combined information from patients, including age, sex, and rapid virus test results, to develop a machine learning model for severe outcome prediction. The developed machine learning model displayed good performance for severe dengue disease prediction, and all information required for the model could be easily obtained. We also found that patients who were over 60 years old, who had detectable nonstructural protein-1 from dengue virus, or who had both detectable anti-dengue IgM and IgG antibodies in their sera, had a greater risk of progression to severe dengue. This study established a new approach to predict dengue disease outcomes by applying machine learning and defined the risk factors for severity prediction.

TI  - Unraveling the invisible leptospirosis in mainland Southeast Asia and its fate under climate change
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Leptospirosis is a neglected waterborne zoonosis of growing concern in tropical and low-income regions. Endemic in Southeast Asia, its distribution and environmental factors such as climate controlling its dynamics remain poorly documented. In this paper, we investigate for the first time the current and future leptospirosis burden at a local scale in mainland Southeast Asia. We adjusted machine-learning models on incidence reports from the Thai surveillance system to identify environmental determinants of leptospirosis. The explanatory variables tested in ourmodels included climate, topographic, land cover and soil variables. The model performing the best in cross-validation was used to estimate the current incidence regionally in Thailand, Myanmar, Cambodia, Vietnam and Laos. It then allowed to predict the spatial distribution of leptospirosis future burden from 2021 to 2100 based on an ensemble of CMIP6 climate model projections and 4 Shared Socio-economics Pathways ranging from the most optimistic to the no-climate policy outcomes (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5). Leptospirosis incidence was best estimated by 10 environmental variables: four landscape-, four rainfall-, two temperature-related variables. Of all tested scenario, the worst-case scenario of climate change (SSP5-8.5) surprisingly appeared as the best-case scenario for the future of leptospirosis since it would induce a significant global decline in disease incidence in Southeast Asia mainly driven by the increasing temperatures. These global patterns are however contrasted regionally with some regions showing increased incidence in the future. Our work highlights climate and the environment as major drivers of leptospirosis incidence in Southeast Asia. Applying our model to regions where leptospirosis is not routinely monitored suggests an overlooked burden in the region. As our model focuses on leptospirosis responses to environmental drivers only, some other factors, such as poverty, lifestyle or behavioral changes, could further influence these estimated future patterns.

TI  - The Progressive Spread of the Vascular Wilt Like Pathogen of <i>Calophyllum</i> Detected in Ranomafana National Park, Madagascar
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
AB  - Pathogens are threatening crops worldwide, but little attention has been given to the threat to tree species in undisturbed rainforest. This communication reports the first case of a tree die off caused by a "wilt" in Madagascar. In 2016 while monitoring monthly tree phenology of Ranomafana National Park (RNP), the Centre ValBio research station observed that manyCalophyllumadult trees had brown wilted leaves. There are three species ofCalophyllumin this rainforest,C. paniculatum,C. drouhardii, andC. milvum, and all three have contracted this pathogen. Our goal was to document the spead of this suspected wilt inCalophyllumtrees and determine if site, elevation and DBH had an influence on tree mortality. In 2019 we conducted an inventory of allCalophyllumtrees in RNP and 42% of the observed trees were dead. The species with the highest mortality wasC. paniculatum, with 53% of trees dead, followed byC. milvumwith 18%, andC. drouhardiiwith only 2% of surveyed trees dead. Bark beetle traces were observed in all deadCalophyllumtrees. Tree death caused by this suspected fungal pathogen has spread across a major river in the area and has been found at mid and high elevations. Our results show thatC. paniculatumtrees with a larger DBH have a higher mortality risk. Our report highlights the importance of fighting invasive pathogens that threaten protected ecosystems.

TI  - Genotyping <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> with the <i>B1</i> Gene in Naturally Infected Sheep from an Endemic Region in the Pacific Coast of Mexico
T2  - VECTOR-BORNE AND ZOONOTIC DISEASES
AB  - Toxoplasma gondii is a protozoan parasite with a broad ecological valence, which has been detected in a wide range of hosts and landscapes. Although the genus is considered monospecific, in recent years it has been demonstrated to exhibit more genetic variability than previously known. In Mexico, there are few genotyping studies, which suggest that classical, autochthonous, and atypical strains are circulating. The goal of this study was to describe T. gondii genetic diversity in naturally infected sheep from Colima, Mexico. This is a good site to study ecological aspects of this parasite since it is located between the Nearctic and Neotropical ecozones and it includes domestic and wild risks for transmission. We analyzed 305 tissue samples of semicaptive sheep from six coastal and central zones of Colima and border zones of Michoacan. We used an 803 bp amplicon of the B1 gene to genotype T. gondii and seroprevalence was determined by ELISA. Indexes for genetic diversity and genetic differentiation were calculated and compared with reference strains from North America (NA) and South America (SA). Twenty-three tissue samples were positive for the B1 gene by PCR, which were sequenced. Crude prevalence was 24.4%. The genetic analysis showed 16 variable sites along the 803 bp region that grouped all sequences into 13 haplotypes in the phylogenetic tree. Bayesian and haplotype network analysis showed nine new B1-types, of which three were frequent and six had unique alleles. Comparisons among sequence sets revealed that the Mexican population had lower differentiation than SA and an intermediate genetic variability between South America and North America. The B1 gene analysis showed new T. gondii haplotypes in naturally infected sheep; therefore, this marker could be initially used in molecular screening studies to identify potentially virulent genotypes of this parasite using natural host samples directly.

TI  - A novel integrated molecular and serological analysis method to predict new cases of leprosy amongst household contacts
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background Early detection of Mycobacterium leprae is a key strategy for disrupting the transmission chain of leprosy and preventing the potential onset of physical disabilities. Clinical diagnosis is essential, but some of the presented symptoms may go unnoticed, even by specialists. In areas of greater endemicity, serological and molecular tests have been performed and analyzed separately for the follow-up of household contacts, who are at high risk of developing the disease. The accuracy of these tests is still debated, and it is necessary to make them more reliable, especially for the identification of cases of leprosy between contacts. We proposed an integrated analysis of molecular and serological methods using artificial intelligence by the random forest (RF) algorithm to better diagnose and predict new cases of leprosy.
   Methods The study was developed in Governador Valadares, Brazil, a hyperendemic region for leprosy. A longitudinal study was performed, including new cases diagnosed in 2011 and their respective household contacts, who were followed in 2011, 2012, and 2016. All contacts were diligently evaluated by clinicians from Reference Center for Endemic Diseases (CREDEN-PES) before being classified as asymptomatic. Samples of slit skin smears (SSS) from the earlobe of the patients and household contacts were collected for quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) of 16S rRNA, and peripheral blood samples were collected for ELISA assays to detect LID-1 and ND-O-LID.
   Results The statistical analysis of the tests revealed sensitivity for anti-LID-1 (63.2%), anti-ND-O-LID (57.9%), qPCR SSS (36.8%), and smear microscopy (30.2%). However, the use of RF allowed for an expressive increase in sensitivity in the diagnosis of multibacillary leprosy (90.5%) and especially paucibacillary leprosy (70.6%). It is important to report that the specificity was 92.5%.
   Conclusion The proposed model using RF allows for the diagnosis of leprosy with high sensitivity and specificity and the early identification of new cases among household contacts.
   Author summary Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae (M. leprae) that can infect cells in the skin and nerves. Despite efforts to eliminate leprosy, the number of M. leprae infected individuals who develop leprosy is still substantial in the world. The diagnosis relies mainly on clinical parameters. Histopathological and bacteriological analysis help to classify clinical forms of patients. Serology and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays are claimed by health professionals as auxiliary tools, but until now these tests have been used almost exclusively in research, with minor use in leprosy reference centers throughout Brazil. Here, we tested quantitative PCR (qPCR) designed to amplify specific M. leprae targets and ELISA assays to detect antibody response to recombinant antigens (LID-1, ND-O-LID). All results were analyzed by multivariate analysis based in artificial intelligence. We chose random forest as a classification algorithm to aid in the diagnosis and the monitoring of contacts. The results allowed us to diagnose cases of leprosy with high sensitivity and specificity and the early identification of new cases among household contacts.

TI  - Systematic identification and characterization of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) during <i>Aedes albopictus</i> development
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - BackgroundAedes albopictus originated in the tropical forests of Southeast Asia and can currently be found on all continents. As one of the main arboviral vectors, the control of Ae. albopictus requires novel strategies, informed by a deep knowledge of its biology. Little is known regarding mosquito long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), which are transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides that lack protein-coding potential and have roles in developmental regulation. ResultsBased on RNA-seq data from five developmental time points, eggs, early larvae, late larvae, pupae, and adults (female and male) of Ae. albopictus, 21,414 lncRNAs were characterized in this study. Differential expression analysis revealed that lncRNAs exhibited developmental stage specificity. The expression of most lncRNAs was upregulated at the onset of metamorphosis developmental stages. More differentially expressed lncRNAs were observed between eggs and early larvae. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) further confirmed that the expression patterns of lncRNAs were obviously correlated with specific developmental time points. Functional annotation using co-expression analysis revealed that lncRNAs may be involved in the regulation of metamorphic developmental transitions of Ae. albopictus. The hub lncRNAs and hub gene clusters were identified for each module that were highly associated with specific developmental time points. ConclusionsThe results of this study will facilitate future researches to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms of lncRNAs in the development of Ae. albopictus and utilize lncRNAs to assist with mosquito control.
   Author summaryAedes albopictus is an invasive vector mosquito associated with substantial public health concerns. It is a vector of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses. High levels of ecological and physiological plasticity promote rapid global invasion. In the absence of effective vaccines or specific antiviral drugs for the majority of arbovirus diseases, vector control is based mostly on chemical insecticides. However, the extensive and intensive use of chemical insecticides for mosquito control has caused several environmental and human health concerns. As holometabolous insects, mosquitoes undergo considerable structural and functional remodeling during the metamorphosis. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been reported to play roles in developmental regulation. To investigate the expression profiles of lncRNAs across the life cycle of Ae. albopictus, five developmental time points, eggs, early larvae, late larvae, pupae, and adults (female and male), covering all developmental stages were included in this study. Differences in lncRNA expression patterns and hub lncRNAs that were highly associated with specific developmental time points were identified. Hub lncRNAs could be used as targets to block the metamorphic process and facilitate the development of efficient and sustainable mosquito control strategies.

TI  - Occurrence of entomopathogenic hypocrealean fungi in mosquitoes and their larval habitats in Central Brazil, and activity against<i> Aedes</i><i> aegypti</i>
T2  - JOURNAL OF INVERTEBRATE PATHOLOGY
AB  - Collecting entomopathogenic fungi associated with mosquitoes and studies on their activity against mosquito developmental stages will improve the understanding of their potential as agents to control important mosquito vectors. Twenty-one strains of entomopathogenic fungi affecting mosquitoes in Central Brazil were studied: 7 of Beauveria bassiana, 7 of Metarhizium humberi, 3 of M. anisopliae, 2 of Cordyceps sp. and one each of Akanthomyces saksenae and Simplicillium lamellicola. These fungi were isolated from field-collected mosquito adults (3 strains) or larvae (a single strain); the other 17 strains were isolated from laboratory-reared Aedes aegypti sentinel larvae set out in partially immersed cages placed in diverse small-to middle-sized aquatic mosquito habitats in or close to areas with secondary tropical forest. The frequent recovery of normally soil-borne Metarhizium spp. and B. bassiana from aquatic habitats is notable. Our laboratory findings indicated that M. anisopliae IP 429 and IP 438 and M. humberi IP 421 and IP 478 were highly active against immature stages and, together with M. anisopliae IP 432, also against adults. These strains appear to be the most promising candidates to develop effective control strategies targeting the different developmental stages of A. aegypti, the most important vector of viral diseases in humans in the tropics.

TI  - Distribution of triatomine species in domestic and peridomestic environments in central coastal Ecuador
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   Although the central coast of the Ecuador is considered endemic for Chagas disease, few studies have focused on determining the risk of transmission in this region. In this study we describe the triatomine household infestation in Manabi province (Central Coast region), determine the rate of Trypanosoma cruzi infection and study the risk factors associated with infestation by Rhodnius ecuadoriensis.
   Methodology/Principal findings
   An entomological survey found three triatomine species (Rhodnius ecuadoriensis, Panstrongylus rufotuberculatus and P. howardi) infesting domiciles in 47.4% of the 78 communities visited (total infestation rate of 4.5%). Four percent of domiciles were infested, and nymphs were observed in 77% of those domiciles. The three species were found in altitudes below 500 masl and in all ecological zones except cloud forest. Within the domicile, we found the three species mostly in bedrooms. Rhodnius ecuadoriensis and P. rufotuberculatus were abundant in bird nests, including chicken coops and P. howardi associated with rats in piles of bricks, in the peridomicile. Triatomine infestation was characterized by high rates of colonization, especially in peridomicile. Flagelates infection was detected in only 12% of the samples by microscopy and Trypanosoma cruzi infection in 42% of the examined triatomines by PCR (n = 372). The most important risk factors for house infestation by R. ecuadoriensis were ecological zone (w = 0.99) and presence of chickens (w = 0.96). Determinants of secondary importance were reporting no insecticide applications over the last twelve months (w = 0.86) and dirt floor (w = 0.70). On the other hand, wood as wall material was a protective factor (w = 0.85).
   Conclusion/Significance
   According the results, approximately 571,000 people would be at high risk for T. cruzi infecintegrated vector management (IVM) program are essential to guarantee sustainable preventive and control strategies for Chagas disease in this region.

TI  - Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus in the guinea pig model: Evidence for epizootic virulence determinants outside the E2 envelope glycoprotein gene
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Epizootic strains of Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) cause epidemics by exploiting equines as highly efficient amplification hosts for mosquito transmission. Although phylogenetic studies indicate that epizootic VEEV strains emerge via mutation from enzootic progenitors that are incapable of efficient equine amplification, the molecular mechanism(s) involved remain enigmatic. The convergent evolution of E2 envelope glycoprotein mutations suggests that they are critical to VEEV emergence, but little is known about the role of non-envelope genes. We used the guinea pig, the small animal model that best predicts the ability to generate equine viremia, to assess the role of envelope versus other mutations in the epizootic phenotype. Using reciprocal chimeric viruses generated by swapping the envelope genes of closely related epizootic IC and enzootic ID strains, infections of guinea pigs demonstrated that envelope and non-envelope genes and sequences both contributed to virulence. However, early replication in lymphoid tissues appeared to be primarily envelope dependent.

TI  - Global warming and amphibian extinctions in eastern Australia
T2  - AUSTRAL ECOLOGY
AB  - Pounds et al. recently argued that the dramatic, fungal pathogen-linked extinctions of numerous harlequin frogs (Atelopus spp.) in upland rainforests of South America mostly occurred immediately following exceptionally warm years, implicating global warming as a likely trigger for these extinctions. I tested this hypothesis using temperature data for eastern Australia, where at least 14 upland-rainforest frog species have also experienced extinctions or striking population declines attributed to the same fungal pathogen, and where temperatures have also risen significantly in recent decades. My analyses provide little direct support for the warm-year hypothesis of Pounds et al., although my statistical power to detect effects of small (0.5 degrees C) temperature increases was limited. However, I found stronger support for a modified version of the warm-year hypothesis, whereby frog declines were likely to occur following three consecutive years of unusually warm weather. This trend was apparent only at tropical latitudes, where rising minimum temperatures were greatest. Although much remains uncertain, my findings appear consistent with the notion that global warming could predispose some upland amphibian populations to virulent pathogens.

TI  - Larvicidal efficacy screening of Anacardaciae crude extracts on the dengue hemorrhagic vector, <i>Aedes aegypti</i>
T2  - TROPICAL BIOMEDICINE
AB  - Vector-borne diseases are still rife because of the re-emergence of diseases transmitted by mosquitoes. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the larvicidal efficacy of crude leaf extract of Mangifera indica, Gluta renghas, and Melanochyla fasciculiflora against vector of dengue hemorrhagic fever, Aedes aegypti. These plant species are endemic species and widely distributed in Malaysian forests. Leaves of Ma. indica, G. renghas and M. fascculiflora were collected from Teluk Bahang National Park, Penang Malaysia. Fractions of leaves were segregated, air-dried, powdered and extracted using Soxhlet with methanol. The solvent was removed by using rotary evaporator to obtain the crude extract. Using WHO standard larval bioassay test method, third instar larvae of Aedes aegypti were exposed to concentration ranging from 200-4500ppm of methanol extract for all plant species. Larval mortality was observed after 24 hours exposure. The highest susceptibility and toxicity was recorded by Mangifera indica with the lowest concentration at 800ppm followed by M. fasciculiflora and G. renghas. This indicates that crude plant extract is very effective in killing Ae. aegypti mosquitoes. This finding may lead to new low cost alternative, environmentally friendly method for mosquito control programs. To our knowledge, this is the first report on larvicidal bioefficacy from endemic Malaysian plants.

TI  - Aqua Solaris - an optimized small scale desalination system with 40 litres output per square meter based upon solar-thermal distillation
T2  - DESALINATION
CP  - European Conference on Desalination and the Environment
AB  - Classical small scale solar distillers (flat collector solar stills) have been in use especially in remote tropical locations for more than a century, but they only utilize a fraction of the available solar energy flux per area. Our aim was to develop a system that optimizes the energy efficiency and approaches the physical limit of freshwater output as close as possible. The construction takes into consideration the general principles of thermodynamics. The evaporation and (cooled) condensation chambers were separated, the evaporation chamber and surface increasing material were expanded into the third dimension (a collector cubicle instead of flat collector), additional mirrors are applied to increase the solar energy input and for wind protection, and the necessary electronic microcontroller that controls the airflow rhythm was empirically optimized by a long series of test runs and measurements. A prototype on the Island of Bonaire currently produces 40 l of freshwater per square meter surface area at an ambient temperature of 30 degrees C for an estimated life cycle of 20 years. The applications are broad. Each unit can supply a large family with freshwater at low costs.. and the water source can be anything from sea water to water polluted with heavy metals and mineral poisons (e.g. arsenic polluted wells in Bangladesh). The concept builds upon readily available low-cost standard materials and parts and can help to alleviate numerous social and environmental problems, including local dependence on bottled water import, the related garbage build-up on islands and adjacent coral reefs, water borne diseases as well as desertification, deforestation and even unemployment. In addition to scientific and technical details various project proposals, participatory approaches with local end-users and business models are presented.

TI  - Congenital Chagas Disease in the Ecuadorian Amazon: Maternal Screening at Delivery and Evaluation of Risk Factors Associated with Vector Exposure
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Congenital infection with Trypanosoma cruzi remains a major route for Chagas disease transmission in endemic and non-endemic regions. We evaluated an intervention strategy aimed to detect congenital Chagas disease cases at a major hospital in the Ecuadorian Amazon via cord blood analysis at the time of delivery. All women giving birth at the hospital during the study period (191) were invited to participate. Among them, two (1.0%) did not adjust to the inclusion criteria and four (2.1%) declined to participate in the study, showing the intervention had good acceptability among the mothers. It was possible to obtain cord blood samples during 146 of the deliveries, and only one woman was found to be seropositive, without evidence of transmission to the newborn at delivery or 8 months later. In addition, sociodemographic and economic characterization of the study population revealed that few women had previous knowledge about Chagas disease (16.1%) whereas more than half (62.5%) recognized the vector. Recognizing the vector and having seen it indoors were associated with women from rural families, involved in agriculture, and hunting in the forest. Interestingly, most women (87.3%) reported having easy access to Ecuador's national health system, suggesting serological screening during prenatal visits would be of value in this province. With a proper prenatal screening system in place, cord blood screening would allow for timely detection of T. cruzi infection in newborns from both seropositive women and the minority (2.1%) of women who do not comply with prenatal care visits.

TI  - Predicting the impacts of land management for sustainable development on depression risk in a Ugandan case study
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Agricultural intensification and expanding protected areas are proposed sustainable development approaches. But, their consequences for mental health are poorly understood. This study aims to predict how forest conservation and contract farming may alter resource access and depression risk in rural Uganda. Residents (N = 695) in 11 communities in Masindi District were asked about their expectations under land management scenarios using scenario-based interviews, household characteristics and depression symptoms. Over 80% of respondents presented with a 'business-as-usual forest access' scenario expected reduced access to forest income and food over the next decade; this number climbed above 90% among 'restricted forest access' scenario respondents. Over 99% of those presented with two land access scenarios ('business-as-usual land access' and 'sugarcane expansion land access') expected wealthy households to gain land but poorer families to lose it, threatening to increase poverty and food insecurity among small-scale farmers. Bayesian structural equation modelling suggested that depression severity was positively associated with food insecurity (0.20, 95% CI = 0.12-0.28) and economic poverty (0.11, 95% CI 0.02-0.19). Decision-makers should evaluate the mental health impacts of conservation and agricultural approaches that restrict access to livelihood resources. Future research could explore opportunities to support mental health through sustainable use of nature.

TI  - Epidemiology of cutaneous leishmaniasis in central Amazonia: a comparison of sex-biased incidence among rural settlers and field biologists
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE & INTERNATIONAL HEALTH
AB  - OBJECTIVE Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is more frequently reported in men than in women; this may be due to male-biased exposure to CL vectors, female-biased resistance against the disease or both. We sought to determine whether gender-specific exposure to vector habitats explains male-biased CL incidence in two human populations of central Amazonia.
   METHODS We compared the CL incidence in one population of field researchers (N = 166), with similar exposure for males and females, and one population of rural settlers (N = 646), where exposure is overall male-biased. We used a combination of questionnaires and clinical data to quantify CL cases, and modelled disease incidence in a Bayesian framework.
   RESULTS There was a moderately higher incidence of CL among men than among women in both populations, but male bias decreased as exposure time increased. Disease incidence was overall higher among field researchers, suggesting that they are an important but understudied CL risk group.
   CONCLUSION Our comparison of two contrasting populations provided epidemiological evidence that CL incidence can be male-biased even when exposure is comparable in both sexes.

TI  - Potential distribution of main malaria vector species in the endemic Colombian Pacific region
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE & INTERNATIONAL HEALTH
AB  - Objective To assess the existing fundamental niche, potential distribution and degree of niche overlap for the three main Colombian malaria vectors Anopheles albimanus, Anopheles darlingi and Anopheles nuneztovari in the major malaria endemic Pacific region.
   Methods We used models based on presence records and Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data, created using the maximum entropy algorithm.
   Results The three vector species occupied heterogeneous environments, and their NDVI values differed. Anopheles albimanus had the largest niche amplitude and was distributed mainly on coastal areas. Environmentally suitable areas for An. albimanus and An. nuneztovari were the dry forest of inter-Andean Valleys in south-western Colombia, as confirmed for An. albimanus during model validation. There was a slight degree of niche overlap between An. darlingi and An. nuneztovari, and the species co-occurred in humid forests, predominantly in riparian zones of the San Juan and Atrato rivers.
   Conclusion The information obtained may be used for the implementation of vector control interventions in selected priority areas to reduce malaria risk in this region while optimising resources.

TI  - Germination and storage characteristics of <i>Prunus africana</i> seeds
T2  - NEW FORESTS
AB  - Prunus africana, from the moist highlands of sub-Saharan Africa, is subject to great exploitation because its bark is used in the treatment of prostate-related diseases. A better understanding of the biology of its seed could help the ex situ and in situ conservation of the species. Fifty per cent of fresh seeds (46.8% MC) from mature purple fruits harvested in Kenya germinated after 10 days incubation at 25degreesC. The germination rate was linearly related to constant temperature, giving a prediction for the minimum temperature for germination at ca. 0.6degreesC. All seeds germinated at 5degreesC during 4 months fully hydrated storage. P. africana seed is, thus, neither dormant nor chilling sensitive. The relationship between equilibrium moisture content and relative humidity was used to construct a sorption isotherm, against which seed desiccation and storage responses were assessed. Seventy six per cent of mature seeds survived drying to 4.5% MC (22% RH) compared to 17% of seeds from immature purple-green fruits. Although, 25-45% of mature seeds survived at 8-12% MC after 2 months, only 10% remained viable after 6-month storage at 5degreesC. This study proposes optimum conditions for the artificial regeneration of P. africana seeds and highlights the need for further experiments storing dry seeds at sub-zero temperatures.

TI  - <i>Quambalaria</i> species: increasing threat to eucalypt plantations in Australia
T2  - SOUTHERN FORESTS-A JOURNAL OF FOREST SCIENCE
AB  - Spotted gum (Corymbia citriodora subsp. variegata and C. maculata) is a valuable source of commercial timber and suitable for a wide range of different soil types in eastern Australia. The main biological constraint to further expansion of spotted gum plantations is Quambalaria shoot blight caused by the fungus Quambalaria pitereka. Surveys conducted to evaluate the impact of Quambalaria shoot blight have shown that the disease is present in all spotted gum plantations and on a range of Corymbia species and hybrids in subtropical and tropical regions surveyed in eastern Australia. More recently, Q. eucalypti has also been identified from a range of Eucalyptus species in these regions. Both pathogens have also been found associated with foliage blight and die-back of amenity trees and Q. pitereka in native stands of Corymbia species, which is the probable initial infection source for plantations. Infection by Q. pitereka commonly results in the repeated destruction of the growing tips and the subsequent formation of a bushy crown or death of trees in severe cases. In comparison, Q. eucalypti causes small, limited lesions and has in some cases been associated with insect feeding. It has not been recorded as causing severe shoot and stem blight. A better understanding of factors influencing disease development and host-pathogen interactions is essential in the development of a disease management strategy for these poorly understood but important pathogens in the rapidly expanding eucalypt ( Corymbia and Eucalyptus spp.) plantation industry in subtropical and tropical eastern Australia.

TI  - Early Events in Chikungunya Virus Infection-From Virus Cell Binding to Membrane Fusion
T2  - VIRUSES-BASEL
AB  - Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a rapidly emerging mosquito-borne alphavirus causing millions of infections in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. CHIKV infection often leads to an acute self-limited febrile illness with debilitating myalgia and arthralgia. A potential long-term complication of CHIKV infection is severe joint pain, which can last for months to years. There are no vaccines or specific therapeutics available to prevent or treat infection. This review describes the critical steps in CHIKV cell entry. We summarize the latest studies on the virus-cell tropism, virus-receptor binding, internalization, membrane fusion and review the molecules and compounds that have been described to interfere with virus cell entry. The aim of the review is to give the reader a state-of-the-art overview on CHIKV cell entry and to provide an outlook on potential new avenues in CHIKV research.

TI  - The removal of a Loa Loa worm in a West African tourist
T2  - KLINISCHE MONATSBLATTER FUR AUGENHEILKUNDE
AB  - Background Loa Loa is a chronic parasitemic disease which is endemic in the tropical rain forests of western africa. Vector of this disease is a mancrove fly with the name Chrysops. Besides the eye worm and skin affections a systemic infection with microfilariae is common.
   Patient A Westafrican tourist from Bangibe showed up at the university eye clinic. His complaints were a red eye and a mobile subconjunctival tumor (Fig. 1) that showed vermiform movements. The worm was transparent and 4-5 cm in length. After topical anaesthesia and the attempt to paralyse the worm (1) with Pilocarpine 2% it vanished. Two days later the patient showed up in the morning for the planned blood test. No worm was visible at that time but at noontime the blood test was carried out and at that time the worm was visible in the nasal conjunctiva. This time the worm was removed without delay under topical anaesthesia. The worm was fixed with a forceps through the conjunctiva which was opened for 0.5 cm. The worm was grasped with a second forceps and drawn out under massive vermiform movement. Systemic therapy was recommended with Hetrazan (Diethylcarbamazine) using Corticosteroides and Antihistamine to minimize allergic side effects by the therapy due to the systemic microfilariae blood load. Eosinophilia was 8%.
   Conclusions A subconjuctival Loa Loa worm can be removed under topical anaesthesia by fixing it with a forceps through the conjunctiva and opening it and grasping the worm with a second forceps. According to our experience the paralysation with Pilocarpine cannot be realized. Careful systemic therapy avoiding reported allergic side effects with Hetrazan which is not available in Germany is necessary.

TI  - Avian research in the Caribbean: past contributions and current priorities
T2  - JOURNAL OF FIELD ORNITHOLOGY
AB  - The islands of the Caribbean contain habitat of critical importance to a large number of endemic and resident birds, as well as many overwintering Neotropical migrants, and they rank as a globally outstanding conservation priority ecoregion and biodiversity hotspot. Considerable research from the region has focused on the ecology of permanent resident species, and these studies have had particular significance for threatened species management, especially parrot biology and conservation, but also for tropical community ecology in general. Work by ornithologists in the Caribbean has been instrumental in improving our understanding of the ecology of overwintering Neotropical migrants and in developing long-term monitoring programs. Although Caribbean-based studies of birds have resulted in significant contributions in many important areas of ecological research, there is a great need for additional research. Especially needed are studies with application to the management of resident species, and studies of how bird populations may be affected by pathogens, parasites, plants, and other types of biotic interactions. Studies focusing on how bird species and populations are affected by global climate change, and cumulative, landscape-level changes in land use are also needed. Along with additional research, scientists have an important role to play in building capacity to prepare the next generation of biologists in the region who will need to address mounting challenges related to biodiversity protection. As with many conservation efforts, funding is a critical need for almost all organizations and agencies involved in research, conservation action, and capacity building in the West Indies.

TI  - Ecoepidemiology of tularemia in the southcentral United States
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - We combined county-based data for tularemia incidence from 1990 to 2003 for a nine-state region (Arkansas. Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma, and Tennessee) in the southcentral United States with Geographic Information System (GIS)-based environmental data to determine associations between coverage by different habitats (especially dry forest representing suitable tick habitat) and tularemia incidence. High-risk counties (> 1 case per 100,000 person-years) clustered in Arkansas-Missouri and far eastern Oklahoma and Kansas. County tularemia incidence was positively associated with coverage by dry forested habitat suitable for vector ticks for Oklahoma-Kansas-Nebraska and Arkansas-Missouri but not for Illinois-Indiana-Kentucky-Tennessee. A multivariate logistic regression model predicting presence of areas with risk of tularemia based on GIS-derived environmental data was developed for the Arkansas-Missouri tularemia focus. The study shows the potential for research on tularemia ecoepidemiology and highlights the need for further modeling efforts based on acarologic data and more fine-scale point or zip code/census tract epidemiologic data.

TI  - Sloth Hair as a Novel Source of Fungi with Potent Anti-Parasitic, Anti-Cancer and Anti-Bacterial Bioactivity
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - The extraordinary biological diversity of tropical forests harbors a rich chemical diversity with enormous potential as a source of novel bioactive compounds. Of particular interest are new environments for microbial discovery. Sloths - arboreal mammals commonly found in the lowland forests of Panama - carry a wide variety of micro-and macro-organisms on their coarse outer hair. Here we report for the first time the isolation of diverse and bioactive strains of fungi from sloth hair, and their taxonomic placement. Eighty-four isolates of fungi were obtained in culture from the surface of hair that was collected from living three-toed sloths (Bradypus variegatus, Bradypodidae) in Soberania National Park, Republic of Panama. Phylogenetic analyses revealed a diverse group of Ascomycota belonging to 28 distinct operational taxonomic units (OTUs), several of which are divergent from previously known taxa. Seventy-four isolates were cultivated in liquid broth and crude extracts were tested for bioactivity in vitro. We found a broad range of activities against strains of the parasites that cause malaria (Plasmodium falciparum) and Chagas disease (Trypanosoma cruzi), and against the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7. Fifty fungal extracts were tested for antibacterial activity in a new antibiotic profile screen called BioMAP; of these, 20 were active against at least one bacterial strain, and one had an unusual pattern of bioactivity against Gram-negative bacteria that suggests a potentially new mode of action. Together our results reveal the importance of exploring novel environments for bioactive fungi, and demonstrate for the first time the taxonomic composition and bioactivity of fungi from sloth hair.

TI  - Epidemiological aspects of autochthonous malaria in the Atlantic forest area of the northern coast of the State of Sao Paulo, 1985-2006
T2  - REVISTA DA SOCIEDADE BRASILEIRA DE MEDICINA TROPICAL
AB  - This study had the aim of analyzing the spatial and temporal distribution of autochthonous malaria cases according to parasite density, symptoms and activity at the time of infection. A retrospective descriptive study was undertaken in the municipalities of Ubatuba, Caraguatatuba, Sao Sebastiao and Ilhabela, covering 1985 to 2006. The data were obtained from the epidemiological investigation files of the Superintendency of Endemic Disease Control and the Information System for Health Threat Notification. Out of the 83 cases notified, 77% were male. Sao Sebastiao and Caraguatatuba presented the largest numbers of cases. The individuals most affected with Plasmodium vivax were at productive ages, with a parasite density of one parasite for every two or more microscope fields. At the time of becoming infected, these patients were mostly doing leisure activities. The main symptoms were fever, headache, sweating and myalgia. Four asymptomatic cases were detected. These data are expected to contribute towards improving the decentralized malaria control actions in the region, through considering malaria among the clinical and/or epidemiological suspicions, with a reference laboratory and trained personnel for adequate diagnosis and treatment.

TI  - Spatial-temporal characteristics of severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome and the relationship with meteorological factors from 2011 to 2018 in Zhejiang Province, China
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   Zhejiang Province has the fifth-highest incidence of severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) in China. While the top four provinces are all located in northern and central China, only Zhejiang Province is located in the Yangtze River Delta region of southeast China. This study was undertaken to identify the epidemiological characteristics of SFTS in Zhejiang from 2011 to 2018.
   Methods
   The epidemic data from SFTS cases in Zhejiang Province from January 2011 to December 2018 were obtained from the China Information Network System of Disease Prevention and Control. Meteorological data were collected from the China Meteorological Data Sharing Service System. A multivariate time series model was used to analyze the heterogeneity of spatial-temporal transmission of the disease. Random forest analysis was performed to detect the importance of meteorological factors and the dose-response association of the incidence of SFTS with these factors.
   Results
   In total, 412 SFTS cases (49 fatal) were reported from January 2011 to December 2018 in Zhejiang Province, China. The number of SFTS cases and the number of affected counties increased year by year. The case fatality rate in Zhejiang Province was 11.89%, which was the highest in China. Elderly patients and farmers were the most affected. The total effect values of the autoregressive component, spatiotemporal component and endemic component of the model in all ranges were 0.4580, 0.0377 and 0.0137, respectively. There was obvious heterogeneity across counties for the mean values of the spatiotemporal component and the autoregressive component. The autoregressive component was obviously the main factor driving the occurrence of SFTS, followed by the spatiotemporal component. The importance scores of the monthly mean pressure, mean temperature, mean relative humidity, mean two-minute wind speed, duration of sunshine and precipitation were 10.64, 8.34, 8.16, 6.37, 5.35 and 2.81, respectively. The relationship between these factors and the incidence of SFTS is complicated and nonlinear. A suitable range of meteorological factors for this disease was also detected.
   Conclusions
   The autoregressive and spatiotemporal components played an important role in driving the transmission of SFTS. Targeted preventive efforts should be made in different areas based on the main component contributing to the epidemic. For most areas, early measures several months ahead of the suitable season for the occurrence of SFTS should be implemented. The level of reporting and diagnosis of this disease should be further improved.
   Author summary
   SFTS is listed as one of the nine most infectious diseases on the WHO priority list. The transmission route and the factors driving the epidemic were complex. Ninety percent of worldwide cases have been reported from China, and Zhejiang Province in China has a high case fatality rate and a high incidence of SFTS. In our study, we found that the numbers of affected counties increased year by year, and the interval from illness onset to confirmation in SFTS was still too long. Furthermore, spatial heterogeneity in the risk factors driving the transmission of SFTS was detected. In addition, the range of suitable weather values for the transmission of SFTS was identified. This suggests that targeted preventive efforts should be made in different areas based on the main factor contributing to the epidemic. In particular, early measures several months ahead of the suitable season for the occurrence of SFTS should be implemented. Enhancement of the level of reporting and diagnosis of this disease should strengthen ongoing research with the incorporation of more risk factors.

TI  - A painful journey to antivenom: The therapeutic itinerary of snakebite patients in the Brazilian Amazon (The QUALISnake Study)
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Author summary
   In the Amazon Region, when individuals are bitten by a venomous snake, they are obliged to seek care in hospitals located in the urban area in order to receive adequate treatment, i.e., the use of antivenom. Despite the fact that snakebites occur mostly in rural areas and riverine and indigenous communities, antivenom is not available in the health units located in these areas. Thus, this individual may take a long time to arrive at the hospital, because in addition to the great distance he/she must travel, there may be difficulties in obtaining transportation. In addition, individuals often use home treatments, believing that they will be effective in reversing the effects of the envenomation. This study was carried out through the application of questionnaires and interviews conducted with patients victims of snakebites treated at the Fundacao de Medicina Tropical Doutor Heitor Vieira Dourado, which is a reference center for the treatment of tropical diseases, including snakebites, and is located in Manaus, capital of the state of Amazonas, Brazil. The patients came from 11 municipalities, and many came from very distant municipalities. The routes, in addition to being long ones, are very fragmented, and require different forms of transport in order to reach the reference hospital. In the places where they perform their daily activities, patients feel safe and do not use protective clothing. Many home treatment practices are used, including some that can be harmful, such as tourniquets. It is common for patients to seek help only when the clinical signs worsen, i.e., when severe pain, extensive edema and bleeding occurs. It is believed that if antivenoms were made available in health units closer to the patients' place of residence, there would be a decrease in cases of delay in treatment, and thus reduce the possibility of complications.
   Access to antivenoms is not guarranteed for vulnerable populations that inhabit remote areas in the Amazon. The study of therapeutic itineraries (TI) for treatment of snakebites would support strategies to provide timely access to users. A TI is the set of processes by which individuals adhere to certain forms of treatment, and includes the path traveled in the search for healthcare, and practices to solve their health problems. This study aims to describe TIs of snakebite patients in the Brazilian Amazon. This study was carried out at the Fundacao de Medicina Tropical Doutor Heitor Vieira Dourado, in Manaus, state of Amazonas, Brazil. The itinerary from the moment of the bite to the patient's admission to the reference unit was analyzed. Sample size was defined by saturation. After an exploratory survey to collect epidemiological variables, in-depth interviews were conducted following a semi-structured guide. Patients originated from rural areas of 11 different municipalities, including ones located >500 kilometers from Manaus. A great fragmentation was observed in the itineraries, marked by several changes of means of transport along the route. Four themes emerged from the analysis: exposure to snakebite during day-to-day activities, use of traditional therapeutic practices, and personal perception of the severity, as well as the route taken and its contingencies. Access to healthcare requires considerable effort on the part of snakebite patients. Major barriers were identified, such as the low number of hospitals that offer antivenom treatment, poor access to healthcare due to long distances and geographic barriers, low acceptability of healthcare offered in countryside, lack of use of personal protective equipment, common use of ineffective or deleterious self-care practices, late recognition of serious clinical signs and resistance to seeking medical assistance. Health education, promotion of immediate transport to health centers and decentralization of antivenom from reference hospitals to community healthcare centers in the Brazilian Amazon are more effective strategies that would to maximize access to antivenom treatment.

TI  - Seasonality of <i>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</i> infection in direct-developing frogs suggests a mechanism for persistence
T2  - DISEASES OF AQUATIC ORGANISMS
AB  - Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), a disease-causing amphibian-specific fungus, is widely distributed in Puerto Rico, but is restricted to elevations above 600 m. The effect of this pathogen in the wild was studied by monitoring Eleutherodactylus coqui and E. portoricensis in 2 upland forests at El Yunque, a site characterized by historic population declines in the presence of chytridiomycosis. We tested a potential synergistic interaction between climate and Bd by measuring prevalence of infection and level of infection per individual sampled (number of zoospores), across the dry and wet seasons for 2 yr (between 2005 and 2007). Infection levels in adult frogs were significantly higher during the dry season in both species studied, suggesting a cyclic pattern of dry/cool-wet/warm climate-driven synergistic interaction. These results are consistent with ex situ experiments in which E. coqui infected with Bd were more susceptible to chytridiomycosis when subjected to limited water treatments resembling drought. Long-term data on the prevalence of Bd in the populations studied versus intensity of infection in individual frogs provided contradictory information. However, the conflicting nature of these data was essential to understand the status of Bd in the species and geographical area studied. We conclude that in Puerto Rico, Bd is enzootic, and vulnerability of eleutherodactylid frogs to this pathogen is related to seasonal climatic variables. Our data suggest a mechanism by which this disease can persist in tropical frog communities without decimation of its hosts, but that complex interactions during severe droughts may lead to population crashes.

TI  - The natural history of Chromoblastomycosis in Madagascar and the Indian ocean.
T2  - BULLETIN DE LA SOCIETE DE PATHOLOGIE EXOTIQUE
AB  - The natural history of chromoblastomycosis was studied in Madagascar by analysing the characteristics of 1323 confirmed cases observed since 1955, including 45 patients receiving a new antifungic drug (terbinafine) during a multicentric study organized in 1995. The surveys data, conserved by he histopathology laboratory in the Institut Pasteur of Madagascar during 40 years, permit this retrospective analysis. The description of two ecosystems, one in the North with Fonsecaea pedrosoi evolving in the tropical rainforest and one in the South with Cladophialophora carrionii (41 % of the whole sample) isolated in the spiny desert, demonstrates that the deforestation, in order to product charcoal and to build houses, is the primary factor associated with this disease. The epidemiologic (87 % of patients are male and 96 % are more than 16 years old, with more than 74 % of the lesions located on feet and legs), mycologic (62 % of the isolated strains belong to the F. pedrosoi species) and therapeutic (low efficiency of thiabendazole in long-term lesions, high efficiency of terbinafine especially on recent lesions and on Cladophialophora-infected patients) aspects of the natural history of chromomycosis confirmed that Madagascar is the most important focus in the world (global prevalence of about 1 for 8500 inhabitants), with few sporadic cases in the other islands of the Indian Ocean (La Reunion, Comoro islands and Mayotte). In the difficult context of Madagascar, the need for a non-specialized laboratory-applicable diagnostic technique that provides infection and species identification led the Institut Pasteur de Madagascar to develop an ELISA-based technique. A large-scale control throughout the country, with the assessment of effective oral chemotherapy with terbinafine, is seen as possible by the authors with the help of the manufacturer.

TI  - A3K2A3-induced apoptotic cell death of <i>Leishmania amazonensis</i> occurs through caspase- and ATP-dependent mitochondrial dysfunction
T2  - APOPTOSIS
AB  - Leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Current therapies mainly rely on antimonial drugs that are inadequate because of their high toxicity and increased drug resistance. An urgent need exists to discover new, more effective, more affordable, and more target-specific drugs. Pathways that are associated with apoptosis-like cell death have been identified in unicellular eukaryotes, including protozoan parasites. In the present study, we studied the mechanism of cell death that is induced by A3K2A3 against L. amazonensis. A3K2A3 is a dibenzylideneacetone that has an acyclic dienone that is attached to aryl groups in both beta-positions, which is similar to curcuminoids and chalcone structures. This compound was previously shown to be safe with regard to cytotoxicity and active against the parasite. Biochemical and morphological approaches were used in the present study. The results suggested that A3K2A3 caused mitochondrial dysfunction in L. amazonensis promastigotes, leading to mechanisms of cell death that share some common phenotypic features with metazoan apoptosis, such as an increase in reactive oxygen species production, a decrease in the adenosine triphosphate ratio, phosphatidylserine exposure, a decrease in cell volume, caspase production, and DNA fragmentation. Altogether, these findings indicate that apoptosis can indeed be triggered by chemotherapeutic agents.

TI  - Effect of Two or Six Doses 800 mg of Albendazole Every Two Months on <i>Loa loa</i> Microfilaraemia: A Double Blind, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Trial
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   Loiasis is a parasitic infection endemic in the African rain forest caused by the filarial nematode Loa loa. Loiasis can be co-endemic with onchocerciasis and/or lymphatic filariasis. Ivermectin, the drug used in the control of these diseases, can induce serious adverse reactions in patients with high L loa microfilaraemia (LLM). A drug is needed which can lower LLM below the level that represents a risk so that ivermectin mass treatment to support onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis elimination can be implemented safely.
   Methodology
   Sixty men and women from a loiasis endemic area in Cameroon were randomized after stratification by screening LLM (<= 30000, 30001-50000, > 50000) to three treatment arms: two doses albendazole followed by 4 doses matching placebo (n = 20), six doses albendazole (n = 20) albendazole or 6 doses matching placebo (n = 20) administered every two months. LLM was measured before each treatment and 14, 18, 21 and 24 months after the first treatment. Monitoring for adverse events occurred three and seven days as well as 2 months after each treatment.
   Principal Findings
   None of the adverse events recorded were considered treatment related. The percentages of participants with >= 50% decrease in LLM from pre-treatment for >= 4 months were 53%, 17% and 11% in the 6-dose, 2-dose and placebo treatment arms, respectively. The difference between the 6-dose and the placebo arm was significant (p = 0.01). The percentages of participants with LLM < 8100 mf/ml for >= 4 months were 21%, 11% and 0% in the 6-dose, 2- dose and placebo treatment arms, respectively.
   Conclusions/Significance
   The 6-dose regimen reduced LLM significantly, but the reduction was insufficient to eliminate the risk of severe and/or serious adverse reactions during ivermectin mass drug administration in loiasis co-endemic areas.

TI  - Enrichment in selected genotypes, basal core and precore mutations of hepatitis B virus in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma in Cameroon
T2  - JOURNAL OF VIRAL HEPATITIS
AB  - Worldwide, the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is known to be influenced by several hepatitis B viral factors. However, the effect of hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotypes and a landscape of nucleotide changes affecting the precore (PC) and basal core promoter (BCP) during infection leading to HCC remain largely unknown in the Central Africa region. Thus, we performed a case-control study on patients with HBV-related HCC and matched controls without HCC but with chronic HBV infection. Genotypes and mutation spectrums were evaluated using a hemi-nested amplification and sequencing analysis focused on the BCP and PC regions. We identified the co-circulation of HBV quasi-subgenotype A3 (QS-A3) and genotype E in both groups. Interestingly, HBV-QS-A3 was significantly more prevalent in patients with HCC (80.0%) than in controls (31.9%, P = 4.5 E-7, OR = 11.5, 95% CI: 3.8-38.5). HBV mutation spectra and nucleotide changes were significantly more polymorphic in patients with HCC. Remarkably, HCC patients infected with HBV-QS-A3 were significantly more mutated compared to patients infected with genotype E (P < 0.0001). In addition, G:C>T:A transversions, generally associated with aflatoxin B1 exposure in tropical regions, were significantly more prevalent in HCC patients infected either with HBV-QS-A3 or HBV genotype E (P = 2.2 E-05) when compared to controls. In conclusion, our results indicate that patients infected with HBV-QS-A3 are at increased risk to develop HCC. In addition, viral genomes isolated for patients with tumour are more heavily altered than those found in controls. Preferential targeting of these patients for antiviral treatment is of paramount importance to reduce future HCC incidence in Cameroon.

TI  - Climatic water balance forecasting with machine learning and deep learning models over Bangladesh
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
AB  - Understanding the impact of input variables on black-box machine learning and deep learning models is necessary. Therefore, this study proposed SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values to address the problem of the interpretability of the output of the support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), convolutional neural network (CNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM) models to forecast climatic water balance (CWB) within 1-3 months lead-time. The current study uses two Koppen-Geiger climate zones over Bangladesh: the humid subtropical climate with dry winter and hot summer (Cwa) and the tropical climate (Af-Am). Monthly antecedent CWB, potential evapotranspiration (PET), convective available potential energy (CAPE), relative humidity (RH), air temperature (TEM), El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), and North Atlantic oscillation (NAO) are used as the inputs to the proposed model. SHAP values show that CWB (current month) for both climate zones has the maximum impact on the prediction. The effects of atmospheric variables and ocean-atmospheric teleconnections on CWB forecasts over Bangladesh are low. Forecasting results show that the SVM model shows the best performance for CWB forecasts in the Cwa and Af-Am climate zones in terms of antecedent CWB as input. And this model effectively decreases the negative effect of increasing forecast lead-time. Since the proposed model can predict CWB in 3-months lead-time, it would help policy-makers and practitioners to reduce the drought and flood impacts in the future by adopting better preparedness plans.

TI  - Ticks and rickettsiae from wildlife in Belize, Central America
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
AB  - Background: The agents of spotted fevers in Latin America are Rickettsia rickettsii, R. parkeri, Rickettsia sp. strain Atlantic rainforest, and R. massiliae. In Continental Central America, R. rickettsii remains the only known pathogenic tick-borne rickettsia. In the present study, ticks were collected from wild mammals in natural areas of Belize. Besides providing new data of ticks from Belize, we investigated rickettsial infection in some of these ticks. Our results provide ticks harboring rickettsial agents for the first time in Central America.
   Methods: Between 2010 and 2015, wild mammals were lived-trapped in the tropical broadleaf moist forests of central and southern Belize. Ticks were collected from the animals and identified to species by morphological and molecular analysis (DNA sequence of the tick mitochondrial 16S RNA gene). Some of the ticks were tested for rickettsial infection by molecular methods (DNA sequences of the rickettsial gltA and ompA genes).
   Results: A total of 84 ticks were collected from 8 individual hosts, as follows: Amblyomma pacae from 3 Cuniculus paca; Amblyomma ovale and Amblyomma coelebs from a Nasua narica; A. ovale from an Eira Barbara; A. ovale, Amblyomma cf. oblongoguttatum, and Ixodes affinis from a Puma concolor; and A. ovale, A. coelebs, A. cf. oblongoguttatum, and I. affinis from two Panthera onca. Three rickettsial agents were detected: Rickettsia amblyommii in A. pacae, Rickettsia sp. strain Atlantic rainforest in A. ovale, and Rickettsia sp. endosymbiont in Ixodes affinis.
   Conclusions: The present study provides unprecedented records of ticks harboring rickettsial agents in the New World. An emerging rickettsial pathogen of South America, Rickettsia sp. strain Atlantic rainforest, is reported for the first time in Central America. Besides expanding the distribution of 3 rickettsial agents in Central America, our results highlight the possible occurrence of Rickettsia sp. strain Atlantic rainforest-caused spotted fever human cases in Belize, since its possible vector, A. ovale, is recognized as one of the most important human-biting ticks in the Neotropical region.

TI  - Conspecific Plant-Soil Feedbacks of Temperate Tree Species in the Southern Appalachians, USA
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Many tree species have seedling recruitment patterns suggesting that they are affected by non-competitive distance-dependent sources of mortality. We conducted an experiment, with landscape-level replication, to identify cases of negative distance-dependent effects and whether variation in these effects corresponded with tree recruitment patterns in the southern Appalachian Mountains region. Specifically, soil was collected from 14 sites and used as inocula in a 62 day growth chamber experiment determining whether tree seedling growth was less when interacting with soil from conspecific (like) than heterospecific (other) tree species. Tests were performed on six tree species. Three of the tree species had been previously described as having greater recruitment around conspecifics (i.e. facilitator species group) compared to the other half (i.e. inhibitor species group). We were then able to determine whether variation in negative distance-dependent effects corresponded with recruitment patterns in the field. Across the six species, none were negatively affected by soil inocula from conspecific relative to heterospecific sources. Most species (four of six) were unaffected by soil source. Two species (Prunus serotina and Tsuga canadensis) had enhanced growth in pots inoculated with soil from conspecific trees vs. heterospecifics. Species varied in their susceptibility to soil pathogens, but trends across all species revealed that species classified as inhibitors were not more negatively affected by conspecific than heterospecific soil inocula or more susceptible to pathogenic effects than facilitators. Although plant-soil biota interactions may be important for individual species and sites, it may be difficult to scale these interactions over space or levels of ecological organization. Generalizing the importance of plant-soil feedbacks or other factors across regional scales may be especially problematic for hyperdiverse temperate forests where interactions may be spatially variable.

TI  - Evaluation of a long-term amphibian monitoring protocol in Central America
T2  - JOURNAL OF HERPETOLOGY
AB  - The Maya Forest Monitoring Project (Mayamon) was established in 1997 as an outgrowth of the Belize working group of the Declining Amphibian Populations Task Force. For nine years, Mayamon volunteers censused anuran populations using a protocol that estimates numbers of individuals on the basis of male vocalization. To date, the protocol has been evaluated only through a series of post hoc power analyses; I performed the first field test to assess the effect of species-specific mating system characteristics, survey length, survey frequency, and pond selection on census results for anuran communities within a tropical moist forest in Belize. Under the current protocol, it would take, on average, 359 months of sampling to detect the 11 species I detected at this site using vocalization surveys. In addition, I introduce a method using ANCOVA to determine ideal survey length. Arbitrarily setting the ideal detection to 90% yields a required sampling protocol of 21 minutes; the current minimum of 15 min yields only an 80% detection rate. This method could be adapted for use with other monitoring programs, allowing both the assessment of current efficacy and the extrapolation of required sampling length to reach a given efficacy. The results of these approaches indicate that the Mayamon protocol methodology should be extended if it is to allow investigators to adequately understand the community dynamics of amphibians.

TI  - Selection of p53 pathway in adaptive evolution and reproductive isolation in incipient sympatric speciation of Drosophila at Evolution Canyon
T2  - BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY
AB  - Sympatric speciation (SS) refers to the origin of new species within a freely breeding population. The 'Evolution Canyon' (EC) in Israel is a natural microsite model for SS of species across phylogenies from viruses and bacteria to mammals, adapting to, and speciating in, interslope microclimates. The cosmopolitan Drosophila melanogaster at EC I, Mount Carmel, is undergoing incipient SS in response to sharply divergent interslope microclimate stresses, including solar radiation, temperature, humidity and pathogenicity. We demonstrated here a selective interslope divergence of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) distribution in the Drosophila p53 pathway. This involves a total of 71 genes, which are associated with DNA repair, heat response, and fungal and bacterial resistant pathways. This distribution pattern links the previously observed thermotolerance and ageing divergence of D. melanogaster between the opposite canyon slopes: the south-facing slope (SFS, or African slope: tropical, savannoid and dry) and the abutting north-facing slope (NFS, or European slope; temperate, forested, cool and humid). The genes with interslope-significant differential SNPs link the p53 pathway with pathways related to the responses to microclimates through protein-protein interaction. Moreover, for the first time we provide evidence that the p53 pathway is linked to reproductive isolation, and is thus actively participating in incipient SS of D. melanogaster. This is the first demonstration of a link between the p53 pathway and reproductive isolation, thereby contributing to adaptive incipient sympatric speciation.

TI  - Identifying Nontraditional Epidemic Disease Risk Factors Associated with Major Health Events from World Health Organization and World Bank Open Data
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Health events emerge from host, community, environment, and pathogen factors-forecasting epidemics is a complex task. We describe an exploratory analysis to identify economic risk factors that could aid epidemic risk assessment. A line list was constructed using the World Health Organization Disease Outbreak News (2016-2018) and economic indicators from the World Bank. Poisson regression employing forward imputations was used to establish relationships with the frequency with which countries reported public health events. Economic indicators demonstrated strong performance appropriate for further assessment in surveillance programming. In our analysis, three economic indicators were significantly associated to event reporting: how much the country's urban population changed, its average forest area, and a novel economic indicator we developed that assessed how much the gross domestic product changed per capita. Other economic indicators performed less well: changes in total, female, urban, and rural population sizes; population density; net migration; change in per cent forest area; total forest area; and another novel indicator, change in percent of trade as a fraction of the total economy. We then undertook a further analysis of the start of the current COVID-19 pandemic that revealed similar associations, but confounding by global disease burden is likely. Continued development of forecasting approaches capturing information relevant to whole-of-society factors (e.g., economic factors as assessed in our study) could improve the risk management process through earlier hazard identification and inform strategic decision processes in multisectoral strategies to preventing, detecting, and responding to pandemic threat events.

TI  - Does Local Adaptation Impact on the Distribution of Competing <i>Aedes</i> Disease Vectors?
T2  - CLIMATE
AB  - Ae. (Stegomyia) aegypti L. and Aedes (Stegomyia) albopictus Skuse mosquitoes are major arboviral disease vectors in human populations. Interspecific competition between these species shapes their distribution and hence the incidence of disease. While Ae. albopictus is considered a superior competitor for ecological resources and displaces its contender Ae. aegypti from most environments, the latter is able to persist with Ae. albopictus under particular environmental conditions, suggesting species occurrence cannot be explained by resource competition alone. The environment is an important determinant of species displacement or coexistence, although the factors underpinning its role remain little understood. In addition, it has been found that Ae. aegypti can be adapted to the environment across a local scale. Based on data from the Neotropical country of Panama, we present the hypothesis that local adaptation to the environment is critical in determining the persistence of Ae. aegypti in the face of its direct competitor Ae. albopictus. We show that although Ae. albopictus has displaced Ae. aegypti in some areas of Panama, both species coexist across many areas, including regions where Ae. aegypti appear to be locally adapted to dry climate conditions and less vegetated environments. Based on these findings, we describe a reciprocal transplant experiment to test our hypothesis, with findings expected to provide fundamental insights into the role of environmental variation in shaping the landscape of emerging arboviral disease.

TI  - Residence-linked human plague in New Mexico: A habitat-suitability model
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of plague, has been detected in fleas and mammals throughout the western United States. This highly virulent infection is rare in humans, surveillance of the disease is expensive, and it often was assumed that risk of exposure to Y. pestis is high in most of the western United States. For these reasons. some local health departments in these plague-affected regions have hesitated to undertake surveillance and other prevention activities. To aid in targeting limited public health resources, we created a fine-resolution human plague risk map for New Mexico, the state reporting more than half the human cases in the United States. Our GIS-based model included three landscape features-a nonlinear relationship with elevation, distance to water, and distance to the ecotone between Rocky Mountain/Great Basin open and closed coniferous woodlands-and yielded an overall accuracy of approximate to 80%. The model classified 17.25% of the state as posing significant risk of exposure to humans on privately or tribally owned land, which suggests that resource requirements for regular surveillance and control of plague could be effectively focused on < 20% of the state.

TI  - Mapping potential <i>Anopheles gambiae s.l</i>. larval distribution using remotely sensed climatic and environmental variables in Baringo, Kenya
T2  - MEDICAL AND VETERINARY ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - Anopheles gambiae s.l. (Diptera: Culicidae) is responsible for the transmission of the devastating Plasmodium falciparum (Haemosporida: Plasmodiidae) strain of malaria in Africa. This study investigated the relationship between climate and environmental conditions and An. gambiae s.l. larvae abundance and modelled the larval distribution of this species in Baringo County, Kenya. Mosquito larvae were collected using a 350-mL dipper and a pipette once per month from December 2015 to December 2016. A random forest algorithm was used to generate vegetation cover classes. A negative binomial regression was used to model the association between remotely sensed climate (rainfall and temperature) and environmental (vegetation cover, vegetation health, topographic wetness and slope) factors and An. gambiae s.l. for December 2015. Anopheles gambiae s.l. was significantly more frequent in the riverine zone (P < 0.05, r = 0.59) compared with the lowland zone. Rainfall (b = 6.22, P < 0.001), slope (b = - 4.81, P = 0.012) and vegetation health (b = - 5.60, P = 0.038) significantly influenced the distribution of An. gambiae s.l. larvae. High An. gambiae s.l. abundance was associated with cropland and wetland environments. Effective malaria control will require zone-specific interventions such as a focused dry season vector control strategy in the riverine zone.

TI  - A Population Study of the <i>Culicoides</i> Biting Midges (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) in Urban, Rural, and Forested Sites in a Cerrado Area of Northeastern Brazil
T2  - ANNALS OF THE ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA
AB  - Culicoides biting midges are medically important haematophagous flies that transmit diseases to animals and humans. This work deals with the basic ecology of Culicoides populations in northeastern Brazil. Adult biting midge populations in and around urban and rural communities were sampled monthly from September 2007 to October 2008 with light traps. In total, 10,803 Culicoides midges representing 17 species were collected. The most frequently collected species were Culicoides paucienfuscatus (83%), Culicoides leopoldoi (12%), Culicoides insignis (2%), and Culicoides paraensis (1%). Trap catches and species diversity were highest in chicken shelters at both urban and rural sites, followed by pigsties. The Culicoides fauna is composed chiefly of species broadly distributed in the Neotropics. Domestic animals are important factors for attracting and maintaining biting midge populations in peridomiciliary areas, especially C. paucienfuscatus. Further work is needed to better understand abiotic and biotic factors affecting Culicoides populations of northeastern Brazil.

TI  - Estimating Mangrove Above-Ground Biomass Using Extreme Gradient Boosting Decision Trees Algorithm with Fused Sentinel-2 and ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 Data in Can Gio Biosphere Reserve, Vietnam
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - This study investigates the effectiveness of gradient boosting decision trees techniques in estimating mangrove above-ground biomass (AGB) at the Can Gio biosphere reserve (Vietnam). For this purpose, we employed a novel gradient-boosting regression technique called the extreme gradient boosting regression (XGBR) algorithm implemented and verified a mangrove AGB model using data from a field survey of 121 sampling plots conducted during the dry season. The dataset fuses the data of the Sentinel-2 multispectral instrument (MSI) and the dual polarimetric (HH, HV) data of ALOS-2 PALSAR-2. The performance standards of the proposed model (root-mean-square error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R-2)) were compared with those of other machine learning techniques, namely gradient boosting regression (GBR), support vector regression (SVR), Gaussian process regression (GPR), and random forests regression (RFR). The XGBR model obtained a promising result with R-2 = 0.805, RMSE = 28.13 Mg ha(-1), and the model yielded the highest predictive performance among the five machine learning models. In the XGBR model, the estimated mangrove AGB ranged from 11 to 293 Mg ha(-1) (average = 106.93 Mg ha(-1)). This work demonstrates that XGBR with the combined Sentinel-2 and ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 data can accurately estimate the mangrove AGB in the Can Gio biosphere reserve. The general applicability of the XGBR model combined with multiple sourced optical and SAR data should be further tested and compared in a large-scale study of forest AGBs in different geographical and climatic ecosystems.

TI  - A FIELD TEST OF INVERSE MODELING OF SEED DISPERSAL
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
AB  - Premise of the study: Seed dispersal distance-a key process in plant population dynamics-remains poorly understood because of the difficulty of finding a source plant so well isolated from conspecifics that seeds or seedlings can be unambiguously attributed to it. Inverse modeling (IM) of seed dispersal, a simple statistical technique for parameterizing dispersal kernels, has been widely used since 1992; surprisingly, however, this approach has never been verified in the field.
   Methods: We released from 20 nearby trees the winged seeds of a liana species, Entada polystachya, near the coast in a tropical, dry forest in Jalisco, Mexico.
   Key results: With a two-parameter log-normal function, we found that IM predicted both the shape and scale parameters well as long as we used the entire data set. When, however, we subsampled (thus simulating the use of transects for seedlings or an array of seed traps), the estimates of the scale and shape parameters were often more than double the real values. The problem was due to the marked anisotropy (directional bias; in this case, in the direction of the diurnal sea breeze) of the individual dispersal curves. When we randomized the direction of dispersal of individual seeds from the trees (keeping dispersal distances unchanged), predictions of parameter values were excellent.
   Conclusions: Inverse modeling must include directional parameters when dealing with areas where strong anisotropy is to be expected, e.g., for wind dispersal of seeds near coasts or pollination by any vector where a plant species is limited to a strongly linear habitat such as river banks.

TI  - Antiplasmodial potential of traditional phytotherapy of some remedies used in treatment of malaria in Meru-Tharaka Nithi County of Kenya
T2  - JOURNAL OF ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY
AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Medicinal plants play a major role in many communities across the world, in the treatment and prevention of disease and the promotion of general health. The aim of the study was to escalate documentation from an earlier study of medicinal plants, traditionally used to combat malaria by the Ameru community of Imenti Forest area and Gatunga in Eastern Region of Kenya, and validate their ethnopharmacological claims by evaluating their antiplasmodial efficacies. Materials and methods: The study was carried out in Meru County at Imenti Forest Game Reserve and in Tharaka Nithi County at Gatunga. Traditional health practitioners (THP) were interviewed with a standard questionnaire to obtain information on medicinal plants traditionally used for management of malaria. Group interviews were also held among THPs and members of the community. The antiplasmodial activities of the crude extracts against chloroquine sensitive (D6) and resistant (W2) Plasmodium falciparum were determined using the semi-automated micro-dilution technique that measures the ability of the extracts to inhibit the incorporation of (G-3H) hypoxanthine into the malaria parasite. Results: Ninety nine (99) species in eighty one (81) genera and forty five (45) families were documented and evaluated for in vitro antiplasmodial activity. Compositae, Fabaceae, Meliceae, Rubiaceae, Rutaceae and Verbenaceae had the highest number of species mentioned in treatment of malaria in Meru/Tharaka Nithi study area. Twenty four (24.2%) species showed antiplasmodial efficacy of IC50 <= 5 mu g/ml and were considered to have potential for isolation of antimalarial compounds. Eight plant (8) species with moderate antiplasmodial activity namely; Cordia africana, Commiphora africana, Elaeodendron buchananii, Gomphocarpus semilunatus, Tarena graveolens, Plectranthus igniarius, Acacia senegal and Ziziphus abyssinica were documented from this region for the first time for the treatment of malaria. The antiplasmodial activity of MeOH root bark extract of Maytenus obtusifolia was very promising (IC50 < 1.9 mu g/ml) and this is the first report on traditional use of M. obtusifolia for treatment of malaria and antimalarial activity. Conclusions: The results seem to indicate that ethnopharmacological inquiry used in search for new herbal remedies as predictive and could be used as the basis for search of new active principles. Eight plant (8) species are documented from this region for the first time for the treatment of malaria. This is the first report on traditional use of M. obtusifolia for treatment of malaria and evaluation of its antiplasmodial activity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Trypanocidal constituents in plants.: 7.: Mammea-type coumarins
T2  - MEMORIAS DO INSTITUTO OSWALDO CRUZ
AB  - Calophyllum brasiliense and Mammea americana (Clusiaceae) are two trees from the tropical rain forests of the American continent. A previous screening showed high trypanocidal activity in the extracts of these species. Several mammea-type coumarins, triterpenoids and biflavonoids were isolated from the leaves of C. brasiliense. Mammea A/AA was obtained from the fruit peels of M. americana. These compounds were tested in vitro against epimastigotes and trypomastigotes of Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiologic agent of Chagas disease. The most potent compounds were mammea A/BA, A/BB, A/AA, A/BD and B/BA, with MC100 values in the range of 15 to 90 mu g/ml. Coumarins with a cyclized gamma,gamma-dimethylallyl substituent on C-6, such as mammea B/BA, cyclo F + B/BB cyclo F, and isomammeigin, showed MC100 values > 200 mu g/ml. Several active coumarins were also tested against normal human lymphocytes in vitro, which showed that mammea A/AA and A/BA were not toxic. Other compounds from C. brasiliense, such as the triterpenoids, friedelin, canophyllol, the biflavonoid amentoflavone, and protocatechuic and shikimic acids, were inactive against the epimastigotes. The isopropylidenedioxy derivative of shikimic acid was inactive, and its structure was confirmed by X-ray diffraction. Our results suggest that mammea-type coumarins could be a valuable source of trypanocidal compounds.

TI  - Pests and diseases regulation in coffee agroecosystems by management systems and resistance in changing climate conditions: a review
T2  - JOURNAL OF PLANT DISEASES AND PROTECTION
AB  - Coffea (Gentianales: Rubiaceae) is an economic plant considering its production income and the number of people that depend on it for their daily livelihoods. Tropical regions predicted to face severe challenges related to climate change impacts often grow coffee. Like other crops, coffee benefits from many ecosystem services, mainly regulating and supporting ecosystem services that play a role in production. Since the emergence of coffee pests and diseases, there have been two primary control techniques: pesticide application and crops management techniques. In most cases, chemical control is nearly ineffective and associated with pesticide resistance, environmental pollution, chemical hazards, and resurgence. This paper reviews management systems and coffee resistance. Studies show that management systems and plant resistance can maintain functional pest and disease regulatory ecosystem services within coffee plantations. We also evaluate how pest and disease regulation services can behave in climate change. The literature shows that managing coffee farms and plant resistance can mitigate the adverse effects of climate change on pest and disease regulation services. Therefore, they can maintain functional ecosystem services and help farmers in tropical areas adapt and be resilient to changing environmental conditions. It is crucial to update these ecological and environmentally friendly control techniques and understand how they will perform under future climate change. Based on the reviewed literature, we identify knowledge gaps and suggest three priority studies in this substantial area of future research. Finding solutions could enhance farmers' perception of interactions between regulation services and climate change and could support ensuring food security.

TI  - A Spatio-temporal Model of African Animal Trypanosomosis Risk
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   African animal trypanosomosis (AAT) is a major constraint to sustainable development of cattle farming in sub-Saharan Africa. The habitat of the tsetse fly vector is increasingly fragmented owing to demographic pressure and shifts in climate, which leads to heterogeneous risk of cyclical transmission both in space and time. In Burkina Faso and Ghana, the most important vectors are riverine species, namely Glossina palpalis gambiensis and G. tachinoides, which are more resilient to human-induced changes than the savannah and forest species. Although many authors studied the distribution of AAT risk both in space and time, spatio-temporal models allowing predictions of it are lacking.
   Methodology/Principal Findings
   We used datasets generated by various projects, including two baseline surveys conducted in Burkina Faso and Ghana within PATTEC (Pan African Tsetse and Trypanosomosis Eradication Campaign) national initiatives. We computed the entomological inoculation rate (EIR) or tsetse challenge using a range of environmental data. The tsetse apparent density and their infection rate were separately estimated and subsequently combined to derive the EIR using a "one layer-one model" approach. The estimated EIR was then projected into suitable habitat. This risk index was finally validated against data on bovine trypanosomosis. It allowed a good prediction of the parasitological status (r(2) = 67%), showed a positive correlation but less predictive power with serological status (r(2) = 22%) aggregated at the village level but was not related to the illness status (r(2) = 2%).
   Conclusions/Significance
   The presented spatio-temporal model provides a fine-scale picture of the dynamics of AAT risk in sub-humid areas of West Africa. The estimated EIR was high in the proximity of rivers during the dry season and more widespread during the rainy season. The present analysis is a first step in a broader framework for an efficient risk management of climate-sensitive vector-borne diseases.

TI  - Molecular characterization of two badnavirus genomes associated with <i>Canna yellow mottle</i> disease
T2  - VIRUS RESEARCH
AB  - Members of the genus Badnavirus have a single non-covalently closed circular double-stranded DNA genome of 7.2-9.2 kb. The genome encodes three open reading frames (ORFs) on the positive DNA strand. Canna yellow mottle virus (CaYMV) is a badnavirus that has been described as the etiological cause of yellow mottle disease in canna, although only a 565 bp fragment of the genome has been previously reported from cannas. In this report, concentrated virions were recovered from infected canna plants and nucleic acids were extracted. Two full-length sequences represent two badnavirus genomes were recovered and were determined to be 6966 bp and 7385 bp in length. These DNAs represent a virus strain belonging to Canna yellow mottle virus and a novel species tentatively termed Canna yellow mottle associated virus. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that these two viruses are closely related to sugarcane bacilliform GD virus, pineapple bacilliform comosus virus, banana streak MY virus, and cycad leaf necrosis virus. We also showed naturally grown canna plants to be frequently co-infected by these two badnaviruses along with a potyvirus, Canna yellow streak virus.

TI  - High-quality <i>Schistosoma haematobium</i> genome achieved by single-molecule and long-range sequencing
T2  - GIGASCIENCE
AB  - Background: Schistosoma haematobium causes urogenital schistosomiasis, a neglected tropical disease affecting >100 million people worldwide. Chronic infection with this parasitic trematode can lead to urogenital conditions including female genital schistosomiasis and bladder cancer. At the molecular level, little is known about this blood fluke and the pathogenesis of the disease that it causes. To support molecular studies of this carcinogenic worm, we reported a draft genome for S. haematobium in 2012. Although a useful resource, its utility has been somewhat limited by its fragmentation. Findings: Here, we systematically enhanced the draft genome of S. haematobium using a single-molecule and long-range DNA-sequencing approach. We achieved a major improvement in the accuracy and contiguity of the genome assembly, making it superior or comparable to assemblies for other schistosome species. We transferred curated gene models to this assembly and, using enhanced gene annotation pipelines, inferred a gene set with as many or more complete gene models as those of other well-studied schistosomes. Using conserved, single-copy orthologs, we assessed the phylogenetic position of S. haematobium in relation to other parasitic flatworms for which draft genomes were available. Conclusions: We report a substantially enhanced genomic resource that represents a solid foundation for molecular research on S. haematobium and is poised to better underpin population and functional genomic investigations and to accelerate the search for new disease interventions.

TI  - Spatial and temporal variations relevant to tsetse control in the Bipindi focus of southern Cameroon
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
AB  - Background: Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) remains a public health problem in many poor countries. Due to lack of financial resources in these countries, cost-effective strategies are needed for efficient control of this scourge, especially the tsetse vector. It was shown that perennial water sources maintain a favourable biotope for tsetse flies and thus the transmission dynamics of sleeping sickness. The present paper aimed at assessing the transmission dynamics of HAT in a forest environment where the hydrographic network is important.
   Methods: Two entomological surveys were carried out in July 2009 and March 2010 in the Bipindi sleeping sickness focus of the South Region of Cameroon. Entomological and parasitological data were collected during both trapping periods (including the climate variations throughout a year) and compared to each other. The level of risk for transmission of the disease during each trapping period was also evaluated at the trap level and materialised on the map of the Bipindi focus.
   Results: Glossina palpalis palpalis was the most prevalent tsetse fly species captured in this focus. The overall densities of tsetse flies as well as the risk for transmission of HAT in the Bipindi focus were significantly higher in July than in March. At the trap level, we observed that these parameters were almost constant, whatever the trapping period, when the biotope included perennial water sources.
   Conclusions: This study shows that the spatial distribution of traps, as well as the temporal climatic variations might influence entomological and parasitological parameters of HAT and that the presence of perennial water sources in biotopes would favour the development of tsetse flies and thus the transmission of sleeping sickness. These factors should, therefore, be taken into account in order to provide more efficient vector control.

TI  - Warming intensifies soil pathogen negative feedback on a temperate tree
T2  - NEW PHYTOLOGIST
AB  - The soil pathogen-induced Janzen-Connell (JC) effect is considered as a primary mechanism regulating plant biodiversity worldwide. As predicted by the framework of the classic plant disease triangle, severity of plant diseases is often influenced by temperature, yet insufficient understanding of how increasing temperatures affect the JC effect contributes uncertainty in predictions about how global warming affects biodiversity. We conducted a 3-yr field warming experiment, combining open-top chambers with pesticide treatment, to test the effect of elevated temperatures on seedling mortality of a temperate tree species, Prunus padus, from a genus with known susceptibility to soil-borne pathogens. Elevated temperature significantly increased the mortality of P. padus seedlings in the immediate vicinity of parent trees, concurrent with increased relative abundance of pathogenic fungi identified to be virulent to Prunus species. Our study offers experimental evidence suggesting that global warming significantly intensifies the JC effect on a temperate tree species due to increased relative abundance of pathogenic fungi. This work advances our understanding about changes in the JC effect linked to ongoing global warming, which has important implications for predicting tree diversity in a warmer future.

TI  - Knowledge and Attitudes about Zika Virus Infection and Vaccine Intent among Medical Students in Costa Rica
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) infection is a public health problem in the Americas. We assessed ZIKV knowledge, attitudes, and future ZIKV vaccine intent among medical students. In this cross-sectional study, a convenience sample of medical students in San Jose, Costa Rica, were surveyed to assess knowledge, attitudes, vaccine intent, and sources of information about ZIKV. Knowledge and attitude scores were calculated. Factors associated with vaccine intent were determined by bivariate analysis using a chi-square test. Of 468 participants surveyed, majority were females (299, 63.8%) and lived in urban areas (411, 87%). The participant mean knowledge score was 12.2 (SD: 3.65) out of a possible 20. Students residing in suburban or rural areas (odds ratio [OR]: 0.432; CI: 0.24-0.78), first- or second-year students (OR: 0.423; CI: 0.27-0.67), and aged < 20 years (OR: 0.586; CI: 0.36-0.97) had significantly lower knowledge scores. The participant mean attitude score was 30.2 (SD: 4.76) on a scale of 13-65, with lower numbers indicating a concern for ZIKV severity. A majority of the participants indicated they would be likely or extremely likely to receive a ZIKV vaccine (420, 89.7%) and recommend the vaccine to their patients (439, 93.8%). Vaccine intent was not influenced by demographics, total knowledge, and attitude scores. Students (388, 83%) identified the Internet as their primary source of ZIKV information. A majority of students demonstrated a positive attitude toward ZIKV and willingness to accept and recommend a vaccine. Low knowledge scores underscore the need for ZIKV education, especially in the early years of medical school. Use of the Internet should be considered in dissemination of ZIKV education.

TI  - <i>Anopheles plumbeus</i> (Diptera: Culicidae) in Germany: updated geographic distribution and public health impact of a nuisance and vector mosquito
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE & INTERNATIONAL HEALTH
AB  - ObjectivesThe aim of this study was to map the current spatial distribution of Anopheles plumbeus in Germany, a potential vector of malaria parasites and West Nile virus. Reports of mass occurrence and nuisance connected with artificial breeding site usage by this species were analysed.
   MethodsDistribution data were collected from 2011 to 2014 mainly through trapping and submissions of adult mosquito specimens to a citizen science project. In the framework of the latter, additional information was gathered on recent nuisance incidents caused by An. plumbeus, including a longitudinal analysis of mosquito occurrence and the impact of management measures at a nuisance site in south-western Germany.
   ResultsBased on the most comprehensive set of collection data obtained during the last decades, An. plumbeus is shown to be widely distributed over Germany. The data also indicate a continuing extension of the breeding site repertoire of the species from natural to artificial habitats that facilitate mass development. Increasing incidents of persistent nuisance suggest that this mosquito species is rarely diagnosed correctly and managed adequately.
   ConclusionsAs An. plumbeus is both a serious nuisance pest and a potential vector species, awareness of this species and the public health problems linked to it should be raised among pest managers and public health personnel.
   ObjectifsLe but de la presente etude etait de cartographier la distribution spatiale actuelle d'Anopheles plumbeus en Allemagne, un vecteur potentiel de parasites du paludisme et du virus du Nil occidental. Les rapports d'occurrence en masse et de nuisances liees a l'utilisation de sites artificiels de reproduction par cette espece ont ete analyses.
   MethodesLes donnees de repartition ont ete collectees de 2011 a 2014, principalement a travers le piegeage et la soumission des specimens de moustiques adultes a un projet scientifique citoyen. Dans le cadre de ce dernier, des informations supplementaires ont ete recueillies sur les incidents de nuisance recents causes par An. Plumbeus, y compris une analyse longitudinale de l'occurrence des moustiques et de l'impact des mesures de gestion sur un site de nuisance dans le sud-ouest de l'Allemagne.
   ResultatsSur base de l'ensemble le plus complet des donnees collectees au cours des dernieres decennies, An. Plumbeus a ete vu comme largement repandu en Allemagne. Les donnees indiquent egalement une extension continue du repertoire des sites de reproduction de l'espece, allant des habitats naturels aux habitats artificiels qui facilitent le developpement de masse. De plus en plus d'incidents de nuisance persistante suggerent que cette espece de moustique est rarement identifiee correctement et geree adequatement.
   ConclusionsComme An. Plumbeus est a la fois un insecte nuisible serieux et une espece vectrice potentielle, la sensibilisation a cette espece et aux problemes de sante publique associes devrait etre effectuee chez les responsables des insectes nuisibles et chez le personnel de sante publique.
   ObjetivosEl objetivo del estudio era realizar el mapa de la distribucion espacial que actualmente tiene el Anopheles plumbeus en Alemania, un vector potencial de parasitos de malaria y del virus del Nilo Occidental. Se analizaron los informes sobre su ocurrencia masiva y las molestias relacionadas con criaderos artificiales.
   MetodosSe recogieron datos de distribucion entre el 2011 y 2014, principalmente mediante un proyecto de ciencia ciudadana en el que atrapaban y entregaban mosquitos adultos. En el marco del proyecto, se recogio informacion adicional sobre incidentes molestos recientes causados por An. plumbeus, incluyendo un analisis longitudinal de presencia de mosquitos y el impacto de las medidas de gestion en un lugar con problemas de infestacion en el sudoeste de Alemania.
   ResultadosBasandonos en los datos mas completos obtenidos en las ultimas decadas, se observa que An. plumbeus esta ampliamente distribuido en Alemania. Los datos tambien indican una continua extension de los criaderos de la especie, desde habitats naturales a artificiales, lo cual facilita su desarrollo masivo. El incremento en incidentes de molestias persistentes sugiere que esta especie de mosquito no suele diagnosticarse y manejarse adecuadamente.
   ConclusionesPuesto que An. plumbeus es al mismo tiempo una peste importante y una especie con potencial vectorial, deberia generarse mayor consciencia sobre su presencia y los problemas de salud publica que podria acarrear entre los especialistas en control de plagas y el personal de salud publica.

TI  - Controlled hypobaric hypoxia increases immunological tolerance by modifying HLA-G expression, a potential therapy to inflammatory diseases
T2  - MEDICAL HYPOTHESES
AB  - One of the most striking characteristics of human beings is the incredible capacity to adapt to different environments. This capacity allowed humans to spread all over our planet, occupying habitats as diverse as deserts, tropical forests or tundra regions. Interactions with the environment, climate, food and water availability shaped our evolution and define our survival. Essential to human life, oxygen availability also controls human dispersion and adaptation. For example, low oxygen availability can lead to physiological adaptations in populations living in highlands. Moreover, the consequences of differential oxygen availability (or even exposure to hypoxia) are evident in process as fine-tuned controlled as gene regulation. Physiological responses to fluctuations in oxygen availability are crucial already from the early days of life, since the human fetal environment is characterized by hypoxia. Hypoxia-Inducible Factors (HIFs) act as major regulators of pathways involved in glycolysis, erythropoiesis, angiogenesis, cell proliferation and stem cells function. Here we explore the physiological consequences of hypoxia in the human organism. In this sense, and considering the existence of HIF sequences in promoter regions of genes important to immune regulation, we hypothesize that exposure to induced hypoxia through the use of hypobaric chambers can be used as a complementary therapy to control chronic inflammation in several diseases characterized by systemic inflammatory conditions. Among these inflammatory conditions we highlight autoimmune diseases and chronic inflammation in HIV infected individuals under antiretroviral treatment. Several experiments, including arthritis animal models, the evaluation of athletes that already use hypobaric chambers to induce erythropoiesis, and the potential consequences of hypoxia as an immunotolerogenic inducer in the HIV infection context are approached and discussed here.

TI  - Migratory birds as vehicles for parasite dispersal? Infection by avian haemosporidians over the year and throughout the range of a long-distance migrant
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY
AB  - Aim 6The role of migratory birds in the spread of parasites is poorly known, in part because migratory strategies and behaviours potentially affecting transmission are not easy to study. We investigated the dynamics of infection by blood parasites through the annual cycle of a long-distance Nearctic-Neotropical migratory songbird to examine the role of this species in dispersing parasites between continents. Location The Americas. Taxon Grey-cheeked Thrush (Catharus minimus, Aves, Passeriformes, Turdidae), Birds. Methods We used molecular and microscopy screening of haemosporidian parasites (Plasmodium, Haemoproteus, and Leucocytozoon) to examine the prevalence, distribution, and diversity of lineages through the annual cycle (breeding, migration, and wintering) of the grey-cheeked thrush in North and Central America, Santa Marta mountains, the Andes, and the Amazon. We aimed to identify transmission areas, to examine the degree of sharing of haemosporidian lineages with resident birds in various areas and to assess the potential role of immunologically naive juvenile individuals in parasite transmission. Results Prevalence and lineage diversity of haemosporidians varied significantly over time, being higher during breeding and fall and spring migration, and declining during wintering. Grey-cheeked thrush shared few parasite lineages with tropical resident birds and slightly more lineages with other migratory and resident boreal species. We detected gametocytes in blood during spring migration stopover, but these were of lineages not found in resident tropical birds, indicating relapses of parasites transmitted elsewhere. Transmission likely occurs mostly on the breeding grounds, where juveniles and adults carried lineages restricted to closely related species of thrushes and other species of boreal birds. Main conclusions Long-distance migratory songbirds are likely not important dispersers of blood parasites because there are ecological and evolutionary barriers to the interchange of parasites across vastly separated areas. Further work with thorough spatial and temporal sampling across other species, and considering the role of vectors, is necessary to understand the ecological and evolutionary factors explaining the distribution of parasites over broad scales.

TI  - Genitalic Differentiations in <i>Neoleucinodes elegantalis</i> (Guenee) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) Associated with <i>Solanaceae</i> Crops in Ecuador
T2  - INSECTS
AB  - Neoleucinodes elegantalis (Guenee) is an oligophagous species of plants in the Solanaceae family that has a broad geographical distribution in the tropical zones of South America. It is the most important insect pest of naranjilla (Solanum quitoense Lamarck), a crop grown in threatened areas of the tropical old-growth forest in Ecuador. In this study, two host-specific populations of N. elegantalis were collected from infested fruit of naranjilla and tree tomato (Solanum betaceum Cavanilles) in different locations. Sexually virgin adult insects (93 females and 103 males) were dissected to extract their genitalia to measure 12 morphological variables in females and six in males, resulting in six and four informative variables respectively. Using univariate and multivariate analysis of variance, it was found that the Solanaceous host was the main factor differentiating the area measurements of the seventh abdominal segment and ostium bursae in female genitalia, and cornuti length in male genitalia. Principal components generated with these measurements were employed in a logistic regression model for the classification of the Solanaceous host. Female genitalia of individuals from S. betaceum showed significantly larger ostium bursae relative to female genitalia from S. quitoense. For males, individuals collected from S. betaceum showed longer cornuti length than samples collected from S. quitoense. The results suggest genotypic differentiation according to the Solanaceous host or phenotypic plasticity in N. elegantalis. Further molecular and bio-geographical studies are needed to properly differentiate N. elegantalis populations that would help in the control of this pest.

AB  - Hibiscus (Hibiscus spp.) are popular ornamental and landscape plants in Hawaii which are susceptible to foliar diseases caused by viruses belonging to the genera Cilevirus and Higrevirus (family Kitaviridae). In this study, a virus infecting H. rosa-sinensis plants displaying foliar symptoms consistent with infection by a kitavirus, including yellow chlorotic blotches with a green perimeter, was characterized. The genome consisted of two RNAs 8.4 and 4.4 kb in length, and was organized most similarly to cileviruses, but with important distinctions. These included the location of the p29 homolog as the 3 '-terminal open reading frame (ORF) of RNA2 instead of its typical locus at the 3 '-end of RNA1; the absence of a p15 homolog on RNA2 and the adjacent intergenic region which also harbors small putative ORFs of unknown function; and the presence of an ORF encoding a 10 kDa protein at the 3 '-terminal end of RNA1 that was also found to be present in the hibiscus green spot virus 2 genome. Spherical particles approximately 55-65 nm in diameter were observed in infected leaf tissue, and viral RNA was detected by reverse-transcription PCR in individual mites collected from symptomatic plants tentatively identified as Brevipalpus yothersi. Although phylogenetic analyses placed this virus between the higrevirus and cilevirus clades, we propose the tentative taxonomic placement of this virus, designated hibiscus yellow blotch virus (HYBV), within the genus Cilevirus.

TI  - Development and validation of short-amplicon length PCR assay for macaques meat detection under complex matrices
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FOOD PROPERTIES
AB  - The macaque (Macaca fascicularis) monkeys are the third largest primate population in tropical forests. Being the potential carrier of Simian Immunodeficiency and Ebola and Corona viruses, as well as being a reli-giously-protected and wildlife-protected species could not save the macaques from being over-hunted and consumed. Despite having needs, methods to detect monkey species in foods are rarely documented. To fill this gap, this article describes a monkey-specific polymerase chain reaction assay targeting a short-site (120 bp) of mitochondrial d-loop gene because the short-length targets are thermodynamically more stable than the longer ones under degrading states. Specificity was tested against 17 terrestrial and aquatic meat and fish species and no cross-species amplification was detected under raw, processed, and admixed states. The sensitivity of the assay was 0.0001 ng DNA under pure states and 0.1% monkey meats in binary meat mixtures. Finally, the assay was validated by digesting the polymerase chain reaction products with AluI and CViKI-1 and distinctive restriction fingerprints for macaque species were demonstrated.

TI  - PCR Amplification-Independent Methods for Detection of Microbial Communities by the High-Density Microarray PhyloChip
T2  - APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Environmental microbial community analysis typically involves amplification by PCR, despite well-documented biases. We have developed two methods of PCR-independent microbial community analysis using the high-density microarray PhyloChip: direct hybridization of 16S rRNA (dirRNA) or rRNA converted to double-stranded cDNA (dscDNA). We compared dirRNA and dscDNA communities to PCR-amplified DNA communities using a mock community of eight taxa, as well as experiments derived from three environmental sample types: chromium-contaminated aquifer groundwater, tropical forest soil, and secondary sewage in seawater. Community profiles by both direct hybridization methods showed differences that were expected based on accompanying data but that were missing in PCR-amplified communities. Taxon richness decreased in RNA compared to that in DNA communities, suggesting a subset of 20% in soil and 60% in groundwater that is active; secondary sewage showed no difference between active and inactive populations. Direct hybridization of dscDNA and RNA is thus a viable alternative to PCR-amplified microbial community analysis, providing identification of the active populations within microbial communities that attenuate pollutants, drive global biogeochemical cycles, or proliferate disease states.

TI  - Detecting and tracking mesoscale precipitating objects using machine learning algorithms
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Accurate identification of precipitating clouds is a challenging task. In the present work, Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Decision Trees (DT), and Random Forests (RD) algorithms were applied to extract and track mesoscale convective precipitating clouds from a series of 22 Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-13 meteorological image sub-scenes over the continental territory of Colombia. This study's aims are twofold: (i) to establish whether the use of five meteorological spectral channels, rather than a single infrared (IR) channel, improves rainfall objects detection and (ii) to evaluate the potential of machine learning algorithms to locate precipitation clouds. Results show that while the SVM algorithm provides more accurate classification of rainfall cloud objects than the traditional IR brightness temperature threshold method, such improvement is not statistically significant. Accuracy assessment was performed using STEP (shape (S), theme (T), edge (E), and position (P)) object-based similarity matrix method, taking as reference precipitation satellite images from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission. Best thematic and geometric accuracies were obtained applying the SVM algorithm.

TI  - The Current and Future Potential Geographic Range of <i>Corynespora</i> Leaf Fall Disease in China
T2  - SENSOR LETTERS
AB  - Corynespora Leaf Fall Disease (CLFD), caused by Corynespora cassiicola (Berk. & Curt.) Wei, is considered a destructive disease of Hevea brasiliensis (Mull. Arg.), and it has posed a serious threat to the healthy development of the natural rubber industry. CLIMEX and ArcGIS were used to determine the potential geographic range of CLFD in the areas of H. brasiliensis cultivation in China under the current environmental conditions. They were also used to assess the distribution sensitivity of C. cassiicola in China based on future climate scenarios. Under current climatic conditions, the area suitable for CLFD encompassed 72% of the total area of H. brasiliensis cultivation, of which 48.6% was projected to have optimal conditions, including areas of H. brasiliensis cultivation in Hainan, Guangxi, most of Guangdong, Hekou in Yunnan, the southern part of Taiwan and Yunxiao in Fujian. As a result of climate change, the distribution of C. cassiicola in China is projected to extend northwards, and areas with optimal conditions will expand. We therefore suggest that monitoring and early warning should be enhanced in the areas suitable for CLFD.

TI  - Heterogeneity in the prevalence and intensity of loiasis in five contrasting bioecological zones in Cameroon
T2  - TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
CP  - Meeting of the Royal-Society-of-Tropical-Medicine-and-Hygiene
AB  - The prevalence and intensity of loiasis were studied in 4532 individuals selected from 42 villages from 5 contrasting bioecological zones in Cameroon from February to July 2001. The individuals were examined for Loa loa microfilaraemia using the thick blood film method. Loiasis was heterogeneously distributed from one bioecological zone to another. The occurrence of the infection was largely related to environmental factors favouring the breeding of Chrysops vectors. The mean prevalence of infection varied from 0% in the grassland savannah, 6.6% in the deciduous equatorial rainforest, 9.7% in the dense-humid equatorial rainforest, to 33.3% in the forested savannah. Loiasis was totally absent in the grassland savannah. The intensity of loiasis infection (L. loa microfilariae per millilitre [mf/mL] of blood) increased with an increase in prevalence, varying from 0 mf/mL in the grassland savannah, 325 mf/mL in the deciduous equatorial rainforest, 433 mf/mL in the dense-humid equatorial rainforest, to 3125 mf/mL in the forested savannah. The proportion of individuals with high (>8000 mf/mL) and very high (>30 000 mf/mL). loa microfilaraemia was greater in bioecological zones with a higher prevalence of L. loa. These results will be valuable for the prediction of loiasis endemicity in different ecological zones of Central Africa and for the refinement of the existing geographical model for the mapping of loiasis.

TI  - A systematic review of dengue outbreak prediction models: Current scenario and future directions
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Dengue is among the fastest-spreading vector-borne infectious disease, with outbreaks often overwhelm the health system and result in huge morbidity and mortality in its endemic populations in the absence of an efficient warning system. A large number of prediction models are currently in use globally. As such, this study aimed to systematically review the published literature that used quantitative models to predict dengue outbreaks and provide insights about the current practices. A systematic search was undertaken, using the Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus and Web of Science databases for published citations, without time or geographical restrictions. Study selection, data extraction and management process were devised in accordance with the 'Checklist for Critical Appraisal and Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews of Prediction Modelling Studies' ('CHARMS') framework. A total of 99 models were included in the review from 64 studies. Most models sourced climate (94.7%) and climate change (77.8%) data from agency reports and only 59.6% of the models adjusted for reporting time lag. All included models used climate predictors; 70.7% of them were built with only climate factors. Climate factors were used in combination with climate change factors (10.3%), both climate change and demographic factors (10.3%), vector factors (5.1%), and demographic factors (5.1%). Machine learning techniques were used for 39.4% of the models. Of these, random forest (15.4%), neural networks (23.1%) and ensemble models (10.3%) were notable. Among the statistical (60.6%) models, linear regression (18.3%), Poisson regression (18.3%), generalized additive models (16.7%) and time series/autoregressive models (26.7%) were notable. Around 20.2% of the models reported no validation at all and only 5.2% reported external validation. The reporting of methodology and model performance measures were inadequate in many of the existing prediction models. This review collates plausible predictors and methodological approaches, which will contribute to robust modelling in diverse settings and populations.
   Author summaryDengue is considered as a major public health challenge and a life-threatening disease affecting people worldwide. Over the past decades, numerous forecast models have been developed to predict dengue incidence using various factors based on different geographical locations. Dengue transmission appears to be highly sensitive to climate variability and change, however quantitative models used to assess the relationship between climate change and dengue often differ due to their distribution assumptions, the nature of the relationship and the spatial and/or temporal dynamics of the response. We performed a systematic review to examine current literature surrounding existing quantitative models based on development methodology, predictor variable used and model performance. Our analysis demonstrates several shortcomings in current modelling practice, and advocates for the use of real time primary predictor data, the incorporation of non-climatic parameters as predictors and more comprehensive reporting of model development techniques and validation.This review collates methodological approaches adopted in the modelling practices in the field across current literature. This will provide an evidence-based framework for upgrading future modelling practice to develop more accurate predictive models with robust techniques. In turn, this also provided an opportunity for the effective distribution of limited public health resources to prepare for demand.

TI  - Regulation of macrophage and monocyte immune responses by water extract from the inner bark of <i>Tabebuia avellanedae</i>
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL PLANTS RESEARCH
AB  - Tabebuia sp. (Bignoniaceae) is representative traditional herbal plants, found in tropical rain forest areas throughout Central and South America. These plants have been mostly used as a folk medicine to treat bacterial infection, blood coagulation, cancer and inflammatory diseases. In this study, we aimed to demonstrate the modulatory role of Tabebuia avellanedae in various macrophage-or monocyte-mediated immune responses using its water extract (Ta-WE). Ta-WE was able to up-regulate cell-cell interaction by decreasing the migration of cells and by enhancing CD29-mediated cell-cell adhesion, and the surface levels of adhesion molecules (CD18, CD29, and CD82) and costimulatory molecules (CD80 and CD86) linked to macrophage stimulation as seen in up-regulation of ROS release. In addition, this fraction also suppressed an alteration in the membrane levels of macrophages such as phagocytic uptake and morphological changes. Therefore, these results suggest that the water extract of T. avellanedae can strongly modulate an ability of macrophages and monocytes to manage immune cell-cell interaction in host defence system.

TI  - China's innovation and research contribution to combating neglected diseases: a secondary analysis of China's public research data
T2  - GLOBAL HEALTH RESEARCH AND POLICY
AB  - BackgroundMany emerging and developing economies, such as China, have played the important roles in combating global neglected diseases (NDs). This study aims to explore China's public landscape of research projects and funding of NDs and to provide empirical evidence on promoting China's participation in addressing global health priorities that disproportionately affect developing countries.MethodsWe systematically sourced China's public funding information from the National Natural Science Foundation of China and provincial science and technology agency websites up to August 16, 2019. Following the G-FINDER R&D scope, we screened projects of NDs for analysis. National-funded projects were reviewed on an annual basis for exploring the trends and distribution of funding flows. Information on provincial-funded projects was compared with national projects by disease, research type, and geographical distribution.ResultsA total of 1266 projects were included for analysis and categorized by year, funding source, recipient, disease, research type, region, and province. China's national public funding for ND research reached a historical peak of USD 16.22 million in 2018. But the proportion of ND research to all public-funded projects was less than 0.5%, and over half of the ND projects were allocated to "the big three," i.e., tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, and malaria. About 58% of national and provincial ND projects focus on basic research. Economically developed regions and municipalities play dominant roles in leading national ND research, such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangdong. Provincial ND projects are primarily driven by endemic regions.ConclusionsAs a new emerging high-tech innovator, China has gradually increased public input to ND-related innovation and research. But there is still a large funding gap among NDs that requires China's increased support and participation. National development plans and cooperative health needs should be taken into account for China's participation in promoting global research and development (R&D) for combating NDs.

TI  - BANANA (<i>MUSA</i>. SPP.) STRAIN 'HD-1' APPRAISAL
T2  - PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
AB  - Being one of the important tropical and subtropical fruit trees, banana (Musa. spp.) belongs to the family Musaceae and the order Scitaminae with two genera, Musa and Ensete. In a field survey, research team has discovered a potential banana mutant strain 'HD-1' with a sound economic value. The results of the finding are as follows: based on Simmonds' classification, the pseudostem of banana strain 'HD-1' is relatively short and purplish red; its upright outward petiole groove has red edges and wraps its pseudostem loosely. Its ploidy is 3x, AAA type. Karyotype analysis shows that the number of chromosomes is 33, the karyotype formula is 2n=3x=33=2L + 3 M2 + 4 M1 + 2 S, 'HD-1' is classified as '1B' type. With the help of ISSR molecular markers, we find thatbanana 'HD-1' has the closest relationship with Pubei and Tianbao dwarf banana; the similarity coefficient is 0.81. In an artificial simulation tests of cold, drought and salt resistance environment changes of physiological and biochemical indexes indicate that 'HD-1' exhibits stronger defense capability than Brazil banana. By way of inoculation with injury of root dipping method, we respectively treat two kinds of banana seedlings inoculated Banana Fusarium wilt race 4 small species. The results show that their resistance evaluation scores are 3 and 4, disease levels are 'susceptible' and 'high sensitivity' respectively. We conclude that 'HD-1' has stronger resistance ability toFusarium wilt than Brazil banana.

TI  - Phytonutrient deficiency: the place of palm fruit
T2  - ASIA PACIFIC JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NUTRITION
CP  - Symposium on North and West African Foods and Health
AB  - The oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) is native to many West African countries, where local populations have used its oil for culinary and other purposes. Large-scale plantations, established principally in tropical regions (Asia, Africa and Latin America), are mostly aimed at the production of oil, which is extracted from the fleshy mesocarp of the palm fruit, and endosperm or kernel oil. Palm oil is different from other plant and animal oils in that it contains 50% saturated fatty acids, 40% unsaturated fatty acids, and 10% polyunsaturated fatty acids. The fruit also contains components that can endow the oil with nutritional and health beneficial properties. These phytonutrients include carotenoids (alpha-, beta- and gamma-carotenes), vitamin E (tocopherols and tocotrienols), sterols (sitosterol, stigmasterol and campesterol), phospholipids, glycolipids and squalene. In addition, it is recently reported that certain water-soluble powerful antioxidants, phenolic acids and flavonoids, can be recovered from palm oil mill effluent. Owing to its high content of phytonutrients with antioxidant properties, the possibility exists that palm fruit offers some health advantages by reducing lipid oxidation, oxidative stress and free radical damage. Accordingly, use of palm fruit or its phytonutrient-rich fractions, particularly water-soluble antioxidants, may confer some protection against a number of disorders or diseases including cardiovascular disease, cancers, cataracts and macular degeneration, cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. However, whilst prevention of disease through use of these phytonutrients as in either food ingredients or nutraceuticals may be a worthwhile objective, dose response data are required to evaluate their pharmacologic and toxicologic effects. In addition, one area of concern about use of antioxidant phytonutrients is how much suppression of oxidation may be compatible with good health, as toxic free radicals are required for defence mechanisms. These food-health concepts would probably spur the large-scale oil palm (and monoculture) plantations, which are already seen to be a major cause of deforestation and replacement of diverse ecosystems in many countries. However, the environmental advantages of palm phytonutrients are that they are prepared from the readily available raw material from palm oil milling processes. Palm fruit, one of only a few fatty fruits, is likely to have an increasingly substantiated place in human health, not only through the provision of acceptable dietary fats, but also its characteristic protective phytonutrients.

TI  - Mammal and Bird Species Distribution at the Woodland-Pasture Interface in Relation to the Circulation of Ticks and Pathogens
T2  - Animal Biodiversity and Emerging Diseases: Prediction and Prevention
CP  - 9th Biennial Conference on Animal Biodiversity and Emerging Diseases - Prediction and Prevention
AB  - The tick vector Ixodes ricinus can be found in pastures in landscapes where pasture and woodland intermix, such as in the bocage. To identify which mammal or bird species could potentially transport ticks between woodland and pasture, we did a species inventory on four French bocage sites in 2005. Fifty-eight species were observed, 21 of which were found in three different habitats: the middle of the pasture, the hedgerow ecotone, and the woodland. Because the bocage is a meeting point for wildlife, domestic animals, and humans, species using the three habitats could potentially be epidemiologic agents for circulation of tick vectors as well as of pathogens. Thus, the bocage could be used as a model landscape for the study of epidemiologic cycles and potential emergence of multiple-host pathogens.

TI  - Temporal and spatial expression of terpene synthase genes associated with agarwood formation in <i>Aquilaria malaccensis</i> Lam
T2  - NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF FORESTRY SCIENCE
AB  - Background: The diseased wood, agarwood, from the tropical tree taxa Aquilaria, is famed for its unique fragrance and medicinal values, mainly due to its richness in secondary metabolites such as the sesquiterpenes. The presence of sesquiterpenes in high numbers and amounts correlates with agarwood of high quality.
   Methods: To understand the synthesis of this important compound, we cloned two candidate genes in the terpenoid synthesis pathway from Aquilaria malaccensis Lam., a major agarwood tree species. The genes encoding sesquiterpene synthase (AmSesTPS1) and delta-guaiene synthase (AmGuaiS1) were successfully cloned from callus RNA, using specific primers derived from transcriptomic data, in a reverse transcription PCR reaction.
   Results: The full-length complementary DNA (cDNA) sequence of AmSesTPS1 was 1632 bp encoding for 544 amino acids, and AmGuaiS1 was 1644 bp encoding for 547 amino acids. Sequence alignment analysis showed that AmSesTPS1 shared between 99 to 100 % identity with sesquiterpene synthase from Aquilaria sinensis (Lour.) Spreng. while AmGuaiS1 shared between 95 to 99 % identity with delta-guaiene synthases from Aquilaria crassna Pierre ex Lecomte and A. sinensis. The genes were functionally characterised in a time course wounding experiment using 3-year-old living trees. Two types of wood samples were collected: (1) from wounded area (S1) and (2) from 5 cm below the wounded area (S2). AmSesTPS1 was highly expressed after 6 h post wounding for both S1 and S2, at a level three-to six-fold higher than that of the unwounded control (0 h), while AmGuaiS1 was induced after just 2 h of wounding (18- and 5.5-fold at S1 and S2, respectively), after which the expression of both genes was lowered. The average normalised expression of both genes at S1 and S2 indicates the genes were also upregulated in the distal area from the wounding site.
   Conclusions: It can be deduced that wounding triggers these two genes in the sesquiterpene synthesis pathway, which ultimately leads to agarwood formation.

TI  - Interactions Between Carnivores in Madagascar and the Risk of Disease Transmission
T2  - ECOHEALTH
AB  - Introduced carnivores exert considerable pressure on native predators through predation, competition and disease transmission. Recent research shows that exotic carnivores negatively affect the distribution and abundance of the native and endangered carnivores of Madagascar. In this study, we provide information about the frequency and distribution of interactions between exotic (dogs and cats) and native carnivores (Eupleridae) in the Betampona Natural Reserve (BNR), Madagascar, using noninvasive camera trap surveys. Domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) were the most frequently detected carnivore species within the BNR, and we found that indirect interactions between exotic and native carnivores were frequent (n = 236). Indirect interactions were more likely to occur near the research station (incidence rate ratio = 0.91), which may constitute a disease transmission hot spot for carnivores at BNR. The intervals between capture of native and exotic carnivores suggest that there is potential for pathogen transmission between species in BNR. These capture intervals were significantly shorter near the edge of the reserve (P = 0.04). These data could be used to implement biosecurity measures to monitor interactions and prevent disease transmission between species at the domestic animal and wildlife interface.

AB  - Background From 2019 to 2021, Rwandan residents of the border with the Democratic Republic of the Congo were offered the Ad26.ZEBOV (adenovirus type 26 vector vaccine encoding Ebola virus glycoprotein) and MVA-BN-Filo (modified vaccinia virus Ankara vector vaccine, encoding glycoproteins from Ebola, Sudan, Marburg, and nucleoprotein from Tai Forest viruses) Ebola vaccine regimen. Methods Nonpregnant persons aged >= 2 years were eligible. Unsolicited adverse events (UAEs) were reported through phone calls or visits, and serious adverse events (SAEs) were recorded per International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use guidelines. Results Following Ad26.ZEBOV, UAEs were reported by 0.68% of 216 113 vaccinees and were more common in younger children (aged 2-8 years, 1.2%) compared with older children (aged 9-17 years, 0.4%) and adults (aged >= 18 years, 0.7%). Fever and headache were the most reported symptoms. All 17 SAEs related to vaccine were in children aged 2-8 years (10 postvaccination febrile convulsions +/- gastroenteritis and 7 fever and/or gastroenteritis). The incidence of febrile seizures was 8 of 26 062 (0.031%) prior to initiation of routine acetaminophen in December 2020 and 2 of 15 897 (0.013%) thereafter. Nonobstetric SAEs were similar in males and females. All 20 deaths were unrelated to vaccination. Young girls and adult women with UAEs were less likely to receive the second dose than those without UAEs. Seven unrelated SAEs occurred in 203 267 MVA-BN-Filo recipients. Conclusions Postvaccination febrile convulsions in young children were rare but not previously described after Ad26.ZEBOV and were reduced with routine acetaminophen. The regimen was otherwise safe and well-tolerated.
   UMURINZI, the largest campaign of the Ad26.ZEBOV/MVA-BN-Filo Ebola vaccination, confirmed previous trials' safety conclusions. Notable findings were rare febrile seizures in young children, reduced second-dose retention in women with incident pregnancy, and more obstetric vs nonobstetric serious adverse events.

TI  - Variations of five eIF4E genes across cassava accessions exhibiting tolerant and susceptible responses to cassava brown streak disease
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Cassava (Manihot esculenta) is an important tropical subsistence crop that is severely affected by cassava brown streak disease (CBSD) in East Africa. The disease is caused by Cassava brown streak virus (CBSV) and Ugandan cassava brown streak virus (UCBSV). Both have a (+)-sense single-stranded RNA genome with a 5' covalently-linked viral protein, which functionally resembles the cap structure of mRNA, binds to eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) or its analogues, and then enable the translation of viral genomic RNA in host cells. To characterize cassava eIF4Es and their potential role in CBSD tolerance and susceptibility, we cloned five eIF4E transcripts from cassava (accession TMS60444). Sequence analysis indicated that the cassava eIF4E family of proteins consisted of one eIF4E, two eIF(iso) 4E, and two divergent copies of novel cap-binding proteins (nCBPs). Our data demonstrated experimentally the coding of these five genes as annotated in the published cassava genome and provided additional evidence for refined annotations. Illumina resequencing data of the five eIF4E genes were analyzed from 14 cassava lines tolerant or susceptible to CBSD. Abundant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and biallelic variations were observed in the eIF4E genes; however, most of the SNPs were located in the introns and non-coding regions of the exons. Association studies of non-synonymous SNPs revealed no significant association between any SNP of the five eIF4E genes and the tolerance or susceptibility to CBSD. However, two SNPs in two genes were weakly associated with the CBSD responses but had no direct causal-effect relationship. SNPs in an intergenic region upstream of eIF4E_me showed a surprising strong association with CBSD responses. Digital expression profile analysis showed differential expression of different eIF4E genes but no significant difference in gene expression was found between susceptible and tolerant cassava accessions despite the association of the intergenic SNPs with CBSD responses.

TI  - Variation of the Phlebotominae (Diptera: Psychodidae: Phlebotominae) Assemblage in Response to Land Use Changes in an Endemic Area of <i>Leishmania</i> Transmission in Northeast Argentina
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - Leishmaniases are a global health problem and in Argentina are considered emerging diseases.The new transmission scenarios of tegumentary leishmaniasis are especially important given that large areas of forest are being transformed into rural and urban systems. The aim of this study was to analyze the impact of the construction of a large public building and a neighborhood on the assemblage of Phlebotominae in a rural area with forest remnants and to correlate the changes observed in the species assemblage with characteristics of the environment. Entomological surveys with light traps were conducted on the construction campus in the northeastern region of Argentina at six sites representing different environmental situations. Structural environmental characteristics and meteorological conditions were recorded and analyzed. At least 16 species of Phlebotominae sand flies were collected, the most prevalent being Nyssomyia whitmani (Antunes & Coutinho), followed by the genus Brumptomyia (Franca & Parrot) and Migonemyia migonei(Franca). Our study provides evidence of how the structure of the assemblages and prevalent species respond to anthropogenic disturbances. As the construction progressed, both Ny. whitmani and the genus Brumptomyia were favored. The genus Brumptomyia was favored at sites surrounded by high proportions of forest, within patches of remnant vegetation, and relatively far from anthropogenic disturbances, while Ny. whitmani, the main vector of tegumentary leishmaniasis in the region, increases their abundant at short and intermediate distances from vegetation margins and areas close to anthropogenic disturbances, therefore increasing the risk of human exposure to vectors.

TI  - Improving spatial prediction of <i>Schistosoma haematobium</i> prevalence in southern Ghana through new remote sensors and local water access profiles
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   Schistosomiasis is a water-related neglected tropical disease. In many endemic low-and middle-income countries, insufficient surveillance and reporting lead to poor characterization of the demographic and geographic distribution of schistosomiasis cases. Hence, modeling is relied upon to predict areas of high transmission and to inform control strategies. We hypothesized that utilizing remotely sensed (RS) environmental data in combination with water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) variables could improve on the current predictive modeling approaches.
   Methodology
   Schistosoma haematobium prevalence data, collected from 73 rural Ghanaian schools, were used in a random forest model to investigate the predictive capacity of 15 environmental variables derived from RS data (Landsat 8, Sentinel-2, and Global Digital Elevation Model) with fine spatial resolution (10 +/- 30 m). Five methods of variable extraction were tested to determine the spatial linkage between school-based prevalence and the environmental conditions of potential transmission sites, including applying the models to known human water contact locations. Lastly, measures of local water access and groundwater quality were incorporated into RS-based models to assess the relative importance of environmental and WASH variables.
   Principal findings
   Predictive models based on environmental characterization of specific locations where people contact surface water bodies offered some improvement as compared to the traditional approach based on environmental characterization of locations where prevalence is measured. A water index (MNDWI) and topographic variables (elevation and slope) were important environmental risk factors, while overall, groundwater iron concentration predominated in the combined model that included WASH variables.
   Conclusions/Significance
   The study helps to understand localized drivers of schistosomiasis transmission. Specifically, unsatisfactory water quality in boreholes perpetuates reliance on surface water bodies, indirectly increasing schistosomiasis risk and resulting in rapid reinfection (up to 40% prevalence six months following preventive chemotherapy). Considering WASH-related risk factors in schistosomiasis prediction can help shift the focus of control strategies from treating symptoms to reducing exposure.

TI  - Bomb-cratered coral reefs in Puerto Rico, the untold story about a novel habitat: from reef destruction to community-based ecological rehabilitation
T2  - REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL
AB  - Ecological impacts of military bombing activities in Puerto Rico have often been described as minimal, with recurrent allegations of confounding effects by hurricanes, coral diseases and local anthropogenic stressors. Reef craters, though isolated, are associated with major colony fragmentation and framework pulverization, with a net permanent loss of reef bio-construction. In contrast, adjacent non-bombarded reef sections have significantly higher benthic spatial relief and biodiversity. We compared benthic communities on 35-50 year-old bomb-cratered coral reefs at Culebra and Vieques Islands, with adjacent non-impacted sites; 2) coral recruit density and fish community structure within and outside craters; and 3) early effects of a rehabilitation effort using low-tech Staghorn coral Acropora cervicornis farming. Reef craters ranged in size from approximately 50 to 400m(2) and were largely dominated by heavily fragmented, flattened benthos, with coral cover usually below 2% and dominance by non-reef building taxa (i.e., filamentous algal turfs, macroalgae). Benthic spatial heterogeneity was lower within craters which also resulted in a lowered functional value as fish nursery ground. Fish species richness, abundance and biomass, and coral recruit density were lower within craters. Low-tech, community-based approaches to culture, harvest and transplant A. cervicornis into formerly bombarded grounds have proved successful in increasing percent coral cover, benthic spatial heterogeneity, and helping rehabilitate nursery ground functions.

TI  - Towards an international plant collection to maintain and characterize the endangered genetic resources of vanilla
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE SECOND INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON PLANT GENETIC RESOURCES OF HORTICULTURAL CROPS, VOLS 1 AND 2
CP  - 2nd International Symposium on Plant Genetic Resources of Horticultural Crops
AB  - The primary gene pool of Vanilla planifolia Jackson, the main source for commercial vanilla, is heavily threatened in its area of origin (Central America) by habitat fragmentation and destruction. In addition, ex situ conserved material is often endangered by viruses such as Cymbidium mosaic virus that easily spread by contact in plant collections. Therefore, there is an urgent need to protect the genetic resources that could be a supply of desirable traits for vanilla production. These resources should include the local varieties cultivated around the centre of origin and in the areas of dispersion, as well as the vanilla relatives estimated to 110 species distributed worldwide. In this respect, a germplasm collection of vanilla species and varieties has been set up by CIRAD in Reunion Island since 2003. It is structured according to three key rules: 1) a strict phytosanitary control of the planting material that is certified free of the viruses known to infect vanilla, 2) a clear specification of the origin and property rights attached to the material in fulfilment with international conventions on biodiversity, and 3) an accurate characterization of the accessions using molecular, morphological and aromatic markers. This collection presently gathers 250 accessions tentatively classified into 22 species. Most of the material belongs to the V planifolia species and originates from the South-Western Indian Ocean area. The tropical and contrasted climatic conditions of Reunion Island should enable blooming and fruiting of most accessions, thus facilitating taxonomic identification and agronomic evaluation. Preliminary results and perspectives regarding the management and characterization of this collection are presented and the standpoint of networking with similar initiatives in favour of vanilla preservation is advocated.

TI  - American cutaneous leishmaniasis in municipalities in the northwestern region of Parana State: use of remote sensing for analysis of vegetation types and places with disease occurrence
T2  - REVISTA DA SOCIEDADE BRASILEIRA DE MEDICINA TROPICAL
AB  - American cutaneous leishmaniasis, an endemic disease in the northwestern region of Parana, Brazil, is transmitted by phlebotomines to man and animals like dogs, armadillos, opossums and wild rodents. This disease has been occurring in places where forests have been felled and on the banks of rivers and lakes with arboreal vegetation, where man comes into contact with infected insects. This disease is a public health problem because of the occurrence of epidemic outbreaks throughout Parana. Because of the importance of finding out about endemic areas, this study used epidemiological file data on patients attended between 1999 and 2004. These data were correlated with areas of forest felling that were identified by means of satellite remote sensing techniques and products. The results showed that the occurrences of cases in the municipalities of this region coincided with the presumed likely areas for patient infection.

TI  - Antibiotics and the Biopolitics of Sex Work in Zimbabwe
T2  - MEDICAL ANTHROPOLOGY
AB  - The advent of antibiotics transformed the global public health landscape, dramatically improving health outcomes. Drawing on historical and ethnographic research on sex work in Zimbabwe, we examine the role of antibiotics in the management of sexually transmitted infections among sex workers, from punitive colonial approaches to "empowerment"-based discourses. We illustrate how programs for sex workers, while valued by these women, are narrow, exclusionary, and enact a pharmaceuticalized form of governance that hangs on the efficacy of antibiotics. With antibiotics' efficacy under threat, we consider how latent colonial logics are in danger of being reactivated to control both infections and women.

TI  - Wetlands and Malaria in the Amazon: Guidelines for the Use of Synthetic Aperture Radar Remote-Sensing
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - The prevention and control of mosquito-borne diseases, such as malaria, are important health issues in tropical areas. Malaria transmission is a multi-scale process strongly controlled by environmental factors, and the use of remote-sensing data is suitable for the characterization of its spatial and temporal dynamics. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is well-adapted to tropical areas, since it is capable of imaging independent of light and weather conditions. In this study, we highlight the contribution of SAR sensors in the assessment of the relationship between vectors, malaria and the environment in the Amazon region. More specifically, we focus on the SAR-based characterization of potential breeding sites of mosquito larvae, such as man-made water collections and natural wetlands, providing guidelines for the use of SAR capabilities and techniques in order to optimize vector control and malaria surveillance. In light of these guidelines, we propose a framework for the production of spatialized indicators and malaria risk maps based on the combination of SAR, entomological and epidemiological data to support malaria risk prevention and control actions in the field.

TI  - Behavioral and structural barriers to accessing human post-exposure prophylaxis and other preventive practices in Arequipa, Peru, during a canine rabies epidemic
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Author summary The city of Arequipa, Peru has been experiencing an outbreak of dog rabies since 2015. The Peruvian Ministry of Health has implemented measures to prevent human infection, including no-cost rabies vaccinations for people bitten by dogs, but health posts report that many people do not utilize the service or complete treatment. We conduct focus groups in urban and peri-urban areas of Arequipa to examine community perceptions and attitudes towards PEP, and organizational and behavioral barriers to initiate and complete the PEP regimen. We observe low awareness of rabies severity, and different practices following a dog bite depending on the community type. Misconceptions about rabies vaccines and mistreatment at health centers also commonly prevent participants from initiating or completing PEP. We identify important behavioral and structural barriers and knowledge gaps that limit preventive strategies against rabies and may threaten successful prevention of dog-mediated human rabies in this setting. Finally, disparate landscapes and topography seem to have different effects on urban and peri-urban participants' use of healthcare resources. Thus, strategies should target the specific needs of each population.
   A canine rabies epidemic started in early 2015 in Arequipa, Peru and the rabies virus continues to circulate in the dog population. Some city residents who suffer dog bites do not seek care or do not complete indicated post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) regimens, increasing the risk of human rabies. The objectives of our study are to qualitatively assess knowledge about rabies, and preventive practices, such as rabies vaccine administration, following a dog bite. We conduct eight focus group discussions in peri-urban and urban communities with 70 total participants. In our results, we observe low awareness of rabies severity and fatality, and different practices following a dog bite, depending on the community type: for example, whereas participants in the urban communities report cleaning the wound with hydrogen peroxide rather than soap and water, participants in peri-urban areas cover the wound with herbs and hair from the dog that bit them. Misconceptions about rabies vaccines and mistreatment at health centers also commonly prevent initiating or completing PEP. We identify important behavioral and structural barriers and knowledge gaps that limit evidence-based preventive strategies against rabies and may threaten successful prevention of dog-mediated human rabies in this setting.

TI  - Spatial predictors of bovine tuberculosis infection and <i>Brucella</i> spp. exposure in pastoralist and agropastoralist livestock herds in the Ruaha ecosystem of Tanzania
T2  - TROPICAL ANIMAL HEALTH AND PRODUCTION
AB  - While many studies investigate animal-related risk factors for disease, few have considered environmental or spatial risk factors in the dynamics of bovine tuberculosis (bTB) and brucellosis. In the Ruaha ecosystem of Tanzania, we investigated the role of household location as a predictor for infection with Mycobacterium bovis and exposure to Brucella in pastoralist and agropastoralist cattle herds in a typical African wildlife-livestock-human interface. ArcGIS was utilized to calculate Euclidian distances between households and the nearest river, village center, protected area, and other infected households, followed by multivariate logistic regression to assess the association between risk factors and herd-level bTB and Brucella outcomes. Global and local spatial clustering of bTB-infected and Brucella-exposed herds was explored using the Cuzick-Edward's test and SaTScan spatial scan statistics. Households located farther from rivers and closer to village centers and herds belonging to agropastoralists were more likely to have bTB-positive cattle. Risk of Brucella exposure increased with proximity to protected areas. One spatial cluster of households with Brucella spp. seropositive cattle was identified. Spatial factors may be useful for assessing disease risk and for formulating intervention and control strategies for households that manage cattle in ecosystems characterized by seasonally limited resources and intense wildlife-livestock interfaces.

TI  - Demographic characteristics, clinical symptoms, biochemical markers and probability of occurrence of severe dengue: A multicenter hospital-based study in Bangladesh
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Establishing reliable early warning models for severe dengue cases is a high priority to facilitate triage in dengue-endemic areas and optimal use of limited resources. However, few studies have identified the complex interactive relationship between potential risk factors and severe dengue. This research aimed to assess the potential risk factors and detect their high-order combinative effects on severe dengue. A structured questionnaire was used to collect detailed dengue outbreak data from eight representative hospitals in Dhaka, Bangladesh, in 2019. Logistic regression and machine learning models were used to examine the complex effects of demographic characteristics, clinical symptoms, and biochemical markers on severe dengue. A total of 1,090 dengue cases (158 severe and 932 non-severe) were included in this study. Dyspnoea (Odds Ratio [OR] = 2.87, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.72 to 4.77), plasma leakage (OR = 3.61, 95% CI: 2.12 to 6.15), and hemorrhage (OR = 2.33, 95% CI: 1.46 to 3.73) were positively and significantly associated with the occurrence of severe dengue. Classification and regression tree models showed that the probability of occurrence of severe dengue cases ranged from 7% (age >12.5 years without plasma leakage) to 92.9% (age <= 12.5 years with dyspnoea and plasma leakage). The random forest model indicated that age was the most important factor in predicting severe dengue, followed by education, plasma leakage, platelet, and dyspnoea. The research provides new evidence to identify key risk factors contributing to severe dengue cases, which could be beneficial to clinical doctors to identify and predict the severity of dengue early.
   Author summaryDengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection mostly in warm and tropical regions, which has been listed as one of the top ten global health threats by the WHO. Among neglected tropical diseases, the mortality of dengue is on the rise. Severe dengue (typically manifested by bleeding, organ dysfunction, and plasma leakage) has become a leading cause of hospitalization for children and adults. There is a higher risk of death if severe dengue cases are not appropriately managed. Therefore, finding biomarkers that can reliably predict the development of severe dengue in symptomatic individuals is one of the main focuses of current research efforts. We found that dyspnoea, plasma leakage, and hemorrhage were the independent risk factors of severe dengue. The predictive probability of occurrence of severe dengue achieved 92.9% among people aged <= 12.5 years with dyspnoea and plasma leakage. Establishing an early warning system for severe dengue based on these factors is essential for triaging in endemic areas. The findings of this study identified possible combinations of severe dengue, which would provide enhanced insight into clinical management and inform prevention programming for severe dengue.

TI  - Sero-prevalence of yellow fever and related Flavi viruses in Ethiopia: a public health perspective
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Background: Yellow fever (YF) is a viral hemorrhagic fever, endemic in the tropical forests of Africa and Central and South America. The disease is transmitted by mosquitoes infected with the yellow fever virus (YFV). Ethiopia was affected by the largest YF outbreak since the vaccination era during 1960-1962. The recent YF outbreak occurred in 2013 in Southern part of the country. The current survey of was carried out to determine the YF seroprevalence so as to make recommendations from YF prevention and control in Ethiopia.
   Methodology: A multistage cluster design was utilized. Consequently, the country was divided into 5 ecological zones and two sampling towns were picked per zone randomly. A total of 1643 serum samples were collected from human participants. The serum samples were tested for IgG antibody against YFV using ELISA. Any serum sample testing positive by ELISA was confirmed by plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). In addition, differential testing was performed for other flaviviruses, namely dengue, Zika and West Nile viruses.
   Result: Of the total samples tested, 10 (0.61%) were confirmed to be IgG positive against YFV and confirmed with PRNT. Nine (0.5%) samples were antibody positive for dengue virus, 15(0.9%) forWest Nile virus and 7 (0.4%) for Zika virus by PRNT. Three out of the five ecological zones namely zones 1, 3 and 5 showed low levels (< 2%) of IgG positivity against YFV. A total of 41(2.5%) cases were confirmed to be positive for one of flaviviruses tested.
   Conclusion: Based on the seroprevalence data, the level of YFV activity and the risk of a YF epidemic in Ethiopia are low. However additional factors that could impact the likelihood of such an epidemic occurring should be considered before making final recommendations for YF prevention and control in Ethiopia. Based on the results of the serosurvey and other YF epidemic risk factors considered, a preventive mass vaccination campaign is not recommended, however the introduction of YF vaccine in routine EPI is proposed nationwide, along with strong laboratory based YF surveillance.

TI  - Comparative Venom Proteomics of Iranian, <i>Macrovipera lebetina cernovi</i>, and Cypriot, <i>Macrovipera lebetina lebetina</i>, Giant Vipers
T2  - TOXINS
AB  - Envenoming by Macrovipera lebetina subspecies causes severe life-threatening difficulties for people living in North Africa and the Middle East. To better understand the pathophysiology of envenoming and improve patient management, knowledge about the venom components of the subspecies is essential. Here, the venom proteomes of Macrovipera lebetina lebetina from Cyprus and Macrovipera lebetina cernovi from Iran were characterized using RP-HPLC separation of the crude venom proteins, SDS-PAGE of fractionated proteins, and LC-MS/MS of peptides obtained from in-gel tryptic digestion of protein bands. Moreover, we also used high-resolution shot-gun proteomics to gain more reliable identification, where the whole venom proteomes were subjected directly to in-solution digestion before LC-HR-MS/MS. The data revealed that both venoms consisted of at least 18 protein families, of which snake venom Zn2+-dependent metalloprotease (SVMP), serine protease, disintegrin, phospholipase A2, C-type lectin-like, and L-amino acid oxidase, together accounted for more than 80% of the venoms' protein contents. Although the two viper venoms shared mostly similar protein classes, the relative occurrences of these toxins were different in each snake subspecies. For instance, P-I class of SVMP toxins were found to be more abundant than P-III class in the venoms of M. l. cernovi compared to M. l. lebetina, which gives hints at a more potent myonecrotic effect and minor systemic hemorrhage following envenoming by M. l. cernovi than M. l. lebetina. Moreover, single-shot proteomics also revealed many proteins with low abundance (<1%) within the venoms, such as aminopeptidase, hyaluronidase, glutaminyl-peptide cyclotransferase, cystatin, phospholipase B, and vascular endothelial growth factor. Our study extends the in-depth understanding of the venom complexity of M. lebetina subspecies, particularly regarding toxin families associated with envenoming pathogenesis and those hard-detected protein classes expressed in trace amounts.

TI  - An autochthonous case of paracoccidioidomycosis in a new area of Ceara State, Northeastern Brazil
T2  - REVISTA DO INSTITUTO DE MEDICINA TROPICAL DE SAO PAULO
AB  - The largest endemic areas of paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) in Brazil comprise the humid agricultural regions of the Southeast, South. and, recently, the Midwest and North regions. The Ceara State, located in the Brazilian Northeast region, presents semi-arid climate in most of its territory, characterized by high temperatures, scarce vegetation and low humidity. The objective of the present study was to describe a new autochthonous case of paracoccidioidomycosis from a distinct area of Ceara and review the characteristics of PCM occurrence in Northeastern Brazil. The patient was a 65-year-old male farmer who denied traveling outside the Ceara State or living in other locations. He was born and lived in the rural area known as Camara, bordering the municipalities of Itapaje and Itapipoca. Camara is one of the highest areas (around 720 m of altitude) of the Uruburetama mountains that exhibits tropical forests and is located in Northern Ceara, distant 139 km from the capital, Fortaleza. The patient sought for care, complaining of an oral lesion that appeared over the past three years. The hard palate lesion biopsy revealed multinucleated cells with cytoplasmic inclusions, compatible with PCM. After culture. P brasiliensis was identified by polymerase chain reaction. Serological testing for PCM was reagent. The patient was treated with itraconazole for approximately 17 months, persisting free of symptoms after 15 months of follow-up. Regarding this new autochthonous case in the Ceara State. PCM should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with suggestive clinical manifestations. proceeding from the mountainous areas of Ceara.

TI  - The biogeography and population genetics of neotropical vector species
T2  - HEREDITY
AB  - Phylogenetic and population genetic data support the Pliocene or Pleistocene divergences of the co-distributed hematophagous insect vectors, the sand fly Lutzomyia longipalpis s. l., the mosquitoes Anopheles darlingi and A. albitarsis s. l., and the triatomines Rhodnius prolixus and R. robustus. We examined patterns of divergence and distribution in relation to three hypotheses of neotropical diversification: Miocene/Pliocene marine incursion, Pliocene/Pleistocene riverine barriers and Pleistocene refugia. Only R. prolixus has a pattern concordant with the refugia hypothesis, and R. robustus conforms to the marine incursion predictions. A. darlingi partially fits the refugia hypothesis. For L. longipalpis s. l. and A. albitarsis s. l., elements of both incursion and refugia hypotheses seem to fit, suggesting perhaps an interaction of factors determining their distribution patterns.

TI  - Chikungunya Virus: An Emergent Arbovirus to the South American Continent and a Continuous Threat to the World
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an arthropod-borne virus (arbovirus) of epidemic concern, transmitted byAedesssp. mosquitoes, and is the etiologic agent of a febrile and incapacitating arthritogenic illness responsible for millions of human cases worldwide. After major outbreaks starting in 2004, CHIKV spread to subtropical areas and western hemisphere coming from sub-Saharan Africa, South East Asia, and the Indian subcontinent. Even though CHIKV disease is self-limiting and non-lethal, more than 30% of the infected individuals will develop chronic disease with persistent severe joint pain, tenosynovitis, and incapacitating polyarthralgia that can last for months to years, negatively impacting an individual's quality of life and socioeconomic productivity. The lack of specific drugs or licensed vaccines to treat or prevent CHIKV disease associated with the global presence of the mosquito vector in tropical and temperate areas, representing a possibility for CHIKV to continually spread to different territories, make this virus an agent of public health burden. In South America, where Dengue virus is endemic and Zika virus was recently introduced, the impact of the expansion of CHIKV infections, and co-infection with other arboviruses, still needs to be estimated. In Brazil, the recent spread of the East/Central/South Africa (ECSA) and Asian genotypes of CHIKV was accompanied by a high morbidity rate and acute cases of abnormal disease presentation and severe neuropathies, which is an atypical outcome for this infection. In this review, we will discuss what is currently known about CHIKV epidemics, clinical manifestations of the human disease, the basic concepts and recent findings in the mechanisms underlying virus-host interaction, and CHIKV-induced chronic disease for bothin vitroandin vivomodels of infection. We aim to stimulate scientific debate on how the characterization of replication, host-cell interactions, and the pathogenic potential of the new epidemic viral strains can contribute as potential developments in the virology field and shed light on strategies for disease control.

TI  - Snakebite Envenomation, Attitudes, and Behavior toward Snakes in Banten, Indonesia
T2  - ANIMALS
AB  - Simple Summary Globally, snake populations are in decline, with conservation efforts hindered by negative attitudes. Meanwhile, snakebite envenomation has been recognized as a serious public health issue, particularly in rural areas where humans and snakes coexist. This study reports the results of a survey conducted in Banten, Indonesia, with the aim of exploring relationships between respondents' experiences, attitudes towards snakes, and behaviors towards snake populations. Our results indicate that snakebite envenomation presents a real threat in our study area, and that venomous snakes are regarded as highly dangerous. Individuals who had heard of others experiencing venomous snake bites were more likely to want populations of venomous snakes to decrease, and those with negative attitudes towards snakes were also more likely to engage in anti-conservation ("try to kill") behavior. Women were more fearful than men, and women and those with lower education levels were more negative toward non-venomous pythons, suggesting that tailoring snake conservation efforts to specific groups based on experiences, education level, and attitudes may increase effectiveness. We propose that greater community knowledge of snakes and increases in local resources and preparedness can also contribute to accomplishing both snake conservation and improved public safety through prevention of snakebite envenomation. Snakes are commonly associated with feelings of anxiety or disgust, and snake conservation is often hindered by negative attitudes and perceptions. Although global snake populations are generally in decline, snakebite envenomation (SBE) continues to be recognized as a serious public health issue, particularly in rural areas of tropical and subtropical countries. Data on SBE, a neglected tropical disease, are lacking, and Indonesia, a hotspot of venomous snake diversity, has no snake bite reporting system. We analyzed 127 survey results in Banten, Indonesia with the aim of documenting SBE and exploring the relationships between respondents' experiences, attitudes, and behaviors toward snakes. Nine percent of respondents had experienced SBE, and knowledge of SBE incidents was associated with negative attitudes toward snake populations, with negative attitudes toward snakes associated with a higher likelihood of anti-conservation behavior. Women were more fearful than men, and women and those with lower education levels were more negative toward pythons (Malayopython reticulatus), suggesting that increased knowledge may aid in snake conservation efforts. Universally negative risk beliefs and attitudes toward venomous snakes indicate a need to reduce the threat of SBE in our study area.

TI  - DISEASE RESISTANCE OF EUCALYPT CLONES TO<i> CERATOCYSTIS</i> MANGINECANS
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL FOREST SCIENCE
AB  - Ceratocystis manginecans is causing serious damage to Eucalyptus plantations in Vietnam. When the stems of 8-month-old ramets of two widely-planted Eucalyptus clones were inoculated with nine C. manginecans isolates in a nursery trial, all caused disease. Using the same methodology, the two most pathogenic isolates were used to rank the resistance of 18 Eucalyptus clones. Significant (p < 0.001) differences among clones were observed for both lesion length and percentage mortality, 90 days after inoculation. Three Eucalyptus hybrid clones and seven E. urophylla clones were highly resistant, with mean lesion length from 0.99 to 2.75 cm and mortality ranging from 0 to 5.0%. The remaining eight clones, including the two clones used to screen the C. manginecans isolates, displayed low to moderate resistance with mean lesion length exceeding 5 cm and mortality ranging from 15.0 to 41.7%. This suggests that there are opportunities to deploy Eucalyptus hybrid and E. urophylla clones, resistant to C. manginecans, to enhance disease resistance through crossing among resistant genotypes.

T2  - FOREST PATHOLOGY
AB  - Sterculia nobilis is an important tropical woody plant with high ornamental and economic value. At present, there are few reports of diseases on this plant. In August 2018, an unknown leaf spot disease was observed on S. nobilis in Nanning, China, affecting the inner leaves of the canopy and causing considerable defoliation. The pathogen was isolated, and pathogenicity tests carried out on detached leaves to verify Koch's postulates. Based on morphological observations and polygenic analyses, the pathogen causing leaf spots on S. nobilis was identified as Colletotrichum siamense.

TI  - From the High Arctic to the Equator: Do Soil Metagenomes Differ According to Our Expectations?
T2  - MICROBIAL ECOLOGY
AB  - Comparing the functional gene composition of soils at opposite extremes of environmental gradients may allow testing of hypotheses about community and ecosystem function. Here, we were interested in comparing how tropical microbial ecosystems differ from those of polar climates. We sampled several sites in the equatorial rainforest of Malaysia and Brunei, and the high Arctic of Svalbard, Canada, and Greenland, comparing the composition and the functional attributes of soil biota between the two extremes of latitude, using shotgun metagenomic Illumina HiSeq2000 sequencing. Based upon classical views of how tropical and higher latitude ecosystems differ, we made a series of predictions as to how various gene function categories would differ in relative abundance between tropical and polar environments. Results showed that in some respects our predictions were correct: the polar samples had higher relative abundance of dormancy related genes, and lower relative abundance of genes associated with respiration, and with metabolism of aromatic compounds. The network complexity of the Arctic was also lower than the tropics. However, in various other respects, the pattern was not as predicted; there were no differences in relative abundance of stress response genes or in genes associated with secondary metabolism. Conversely, CRISPR genes, phage-related genes, and virulence disease and defense genes, were unexpectedly more abundant in the Arctic, suggesting more intense biotic interaction. Also, eukaryote diversity and bacterial diversity were higher in the Arctic of Svalbard compared to tropical Brunei, which is consistent with what may expected from amplicon studies in terms of the higher pH of the Svalbard soil. Our results in some respects confirm expectations of how tropical versus polar nature may differ, and in other respects challenge them.

TI  - Conventional breeding for resistance to <i>Bemisia tabaci</i>-transmitted geminiviruses
T2  - CROP PROTECTION
CP  - 21st International Congress of Entomology
AB  - The whitefly Bemisia tabaci Genn. is a pervasive pest and vector of plant viruses. The existence of B. tabaci biotypes and numerous whitefly-transmitted geminiviruses (begomoviruses) affecting food and industrial crops has become a major constraint to agricultural development in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. The predominant whitefly and begomovirus method of control has been the application of insecticides. The excessive use of agrochemicals over the past decades. has contributed to an exponential increase in B. tabaci populations and incidence of begomoviruses transmitted by this whitefly vector. Under these conditions, biological and integrated whitefly/geminivirus control practices have not met expectations. Incorporating begomovirus resistance in a relatively small number of crops improved by conventional plant breeding methods has been a sustainable and efficient disease control strategy. This review discusses some of the conventional intra- and interspecific hybridization strategies followed to incorporate genetic resistance to begomoviruses in three major crops: cassava, common bean and tomato.

T2  - REVISTA CIENTIFICA-FACULTAD DE CIENCIAS VETERINARIAS
AB  - Cutaneous pythiosis (CP) is a chronic, granulomatous, pruritic and rapidly progressive disease that occurs in regions with temperatures ranging from temperate to hot climates, such as tropical and subtropical forests. Caused by Pythium insidiosum, a microorganism classified in the Phylum Pseudokingi, Class Oomycetes, Order Pythiales, Family Pythiaceae and Genus Pythium. It is known in Colombia as "equine espundia", in Brazil as "ferida brava, mal de los marshos and ferida de moda" and in other parts of the world as "granular dermatitis, leeches of Florida, fungus of the gulf coast, bursatee and pythiosis has been reported in several tropical and subtropical cuntries around the world, mainly in southern Brazil, Venezuela, Colombia, the United States of NorthAmerican, etc. Disabling injuries are located particularly in the limbs, mouth and chest, because they are the areas of greatest exposure to the microorganism, macroscopically, it is characterized by the presence of inflammatory ulcerated and granulomatous lesions, with irregular and crater-shaped edges, of different sizes, wet in most cases, may present pathways fistulous with occasional discharge of serosanguineous or purulent white-yellow material There are reports in the literature of various therapies with the aim of imine the etiological agent of the disease (P. insidiosum), improve tissue quality and promote tissue repair. The aim of the present study was to clinically characterize CP in a donkey (Equus asinus africanus) treated with triamcinolone. A descriptive, non-probabilistic study was conducted in convenience animals with presence of pyogranulomatous skin lesions compatible with Pythiosis, diagnosed with clinical examination and histopathological evaluations. After the definitive diagnosis, a treatment with intramuscular way of triamcinolone acetonide was established at a dose of 50 mg total for two applications with an interval of 15 days. The definitive diagnosis was based on the results of the histopathological tests, where it was found in the coloration with haematoxilin and eosine lesions compatible with pythiosis.

TI  - Association of HTLV-1 infection prevalence with TLR7 single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs179008 & rs179009) in asymptomatic blood donors in Khorasan Province of Iran
T2  - GENE REPORTS
AB  - Background: Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) cause two diseases in humans such as adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) and HTLV-1 associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). About, 15-20 million persons are infected with HTLV-1 in worldwide. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are a genetic variation that occurs in >1% of the general population; they can alter promoter activities, gene expression, mRNA stability, and protein structure and function. Our aim in this study was to investigate the association between SNPs within Toll like receptor 7 (TLR7) (rs179008 and rs179009) and susceptibility to HTLV-1 infection among asymptomatic blood donors in Iran. Methods: A total of 100 asymptomatic HTLV-1 carriers and 118 healthy blood donors were studied. After extracting genomic DNA from all samples, amplification was performed using specific primers. Then, the restriction fragmentation length polymorphism (RFLP) method was used to evaluate the SNPs within TLR7. Data analysis was administered using SPSS version 22. Results: The frequency of the AA, AT, TT genotypes of TLR7 (rs178008) was 73%, 22%, and 5% in the patient group; while for those in the control group the values were 50%, 40.7%, and 9.3%, respectively. Moreover, the frequency of the TLR7 rs179008 A allele was 84% in the HTLV-1 patients group and 69.6 % in the control group. Also, the two groups were significantly different concerning the frequency distribution of the TLR7 (rs178008) genotypes and alleles (p = 0.001). Conclusion: There was a significant association between TLR7 (rs178008) SNP and HTLV-1 infection and the T allele of TLR7 (rs178008) SNP might be considered as a protective factor against HTLV-1 virus infection although additional evidence is needed.

TI  - What Constitutes Protective Immunity Following Yellow Fever Vaccination?
T2  - VACCINES
AB  - Yellow fever (YF) remains a threat to global health, with an increasing number of major outbreaks in the tropical areas of the world over the recent past. In light of this, the Eliminate Yellow Fever Epidemics Strategy was established with the aim of protecting one billion people at risk of YF through vaccination by the year 2026. The current YF vaccine gives excellent protection, but its use is limited by shortages in supply due to the difficulties in producing the vaccine. There are good grounds for believing that alternative fractional dosing regimens can produce strong protection and overcome the problem of supply shortages as less vaccine is required per person. However, immune responses to these vaccination approaches are yet to be fully understood. In addition, published data on immune responses following YF vaccination have mostly quantified neutralising antibody titers. However, vaccine-induced antibodies can confer immunity through other antibody effector functions beyond neutralisation, and an effective vaccine is also likely to induce strong and persistent memory T cell responses. This review highlights the gaps in knowledge in the characterisation of YF vaccine-induced protective immunity in the absence or presence of neutralising antibodies. The assessment of biophysical antibody characteristics and cell-mediated immunity following YF vaccination could help provide a comprehensive landscape of YF vaccine-induced immunity and a better understanding of correlates of protective immunity.

TI  - Genetic diversity of adenovirus in neotropical bats from Brazil
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Bats can harbor a diversity of viruses, such as adenovirus. Ten different species of bat adenoviruses (BtAdV A to J) have been previous described worlwide. In Brazil, BtAdV was described in three species of phyllostomid species: Artibeus lituratus, Desmodus rotundus, and Sturnira lilium. There are around 180 bat species in Brazil, with 67% inhabiting the Atlantic Forest, with few information about the circulation of BtAdV in this biome. We aimed to describe the molecular detection and the phylogenetic characterization and suggest a classification of BtAdVs circulating in bats from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We collected 382 oral and rectal swabs from 208 bats between 2014-2015 and 2020-2021 from Sao Paulo, Pernambuco, and Santa Catarina Brazilian states. The adenovirus detection was done by a nested PCR targeting the DNA polymerase gene, and all positive samples were sequenced by the Sanger method. The phylogenetic analyses were based on the amino acid sequences using the MEGA 7 and BEAST software. We obtained 16 positive animals (detection rate 7.7%) belonging to seven bat species: Artibeus lituratus, Carollia perspicillata, Sturnira lilium, Molossus molossus, and the first record of Phyllostomus discolor, Eptesicus diminutus, and Myotis riparius. The phylogenetic analysis based on partial amino acid sequences showed that all obtained AdV sequences belong to the Mastadenovirus genus. We observed a high genetic diversity of BtAdV and identified eleven potential BtAdV species circulating in Brazil (BtAdV K to U). Our results contribute to the epidemiological surveillance of adenovirus, increasing the knowledge about the viral diversity and the distribution of AdV in bats from the Atlantic Forest.

T2  - TROPICAL BIOMEDICINE
AB  - Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a highly contagious viral disease that predominantly affects children younger than 5 years old. HFMD is primarily caused by enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) and coxsackievirus A16 (CV-A16). However, coxsackievirus A10 (CV-A10) and coxsackievirus A6 (CV-A6) are being increasingly reported as the predominant causative of HFMD outbreaks worldwide since the past decade. To date, there are still no licensed multivalent vaccines or antiviral drugs targeting enteroviruses that cause HFMD, despite HFMD outbreaks are still being frequently reported, especially in Asia-Pacific countries. The high rate of transmission, morbidity and potential neurological complications of HFMD is indeed making the development of broad-spectrum antiviral drugs/agents against these enteroviruses a compelling need. In this study, we have investigated the in vitro antiviral effect of 4 Ganoderma neo-japonicum Imazeki (GNJI) crude extracts (S1-S4) against EV-A71, CV-A16, CV-A10 and CV-A6. GNJI is a medicinal mushroom that can be found growing saprophytically on decaying bamboo clumps in Malaysian forests. The antiviral effects of this medicinal mushroom were determined using cytopathic inhibition and virus titration assays. The S2 (1.25 mg/ml) hot aqueous extract demonstrated the highest broad-spectrum antiviral activity against all tested enteroviruses in human primary oral fibroblast cells. Replication of EV-A71, CV-A16 and CV-A10 were effectively inhibited at 2 hours post-infection (hpi) to 72 hpi, except for CV-A6 which was only at 2 hpi. S2 also has virucidal activity against EV-A71. Polysaccharides isolated and purified from crude hot aqueous extract demonstrated similar antiviral activity as S2, suggesting that polysaccharides could be one of the active compounds responsible for the antiviral activity shown by S2. To our knowledge, this study demonstrates for the first time the ability of GNJI to inhibit enterovirus infection and replication. Thus, GNJI is potential to be further developed as an antiviral agent against enteroviruses that caused HFMD.

TI  - Environmental influences on <i>Aedes aegypti</i> catches in Biogents Sentinel traps during a Californian "rear and release" program: Implications for designing surveillance programs
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - As Aedes aegypti continues to expand its global distribution, the diseases it vectors (dengue, Zika, chikungunya and yellow fever) are of increasing concern. Modern efforts to control this species include "rear and release" strategies where lab-reared mosquitoes are distributed throughout the landscape to replace or suppress invasive populations. These programs require intensive surveillance efforts to monitor their success, and the Biogents Sentinel (BGS) trap is one of the most effective tools for sampling adult Ae. aegypti. BGS trap catches can be highly variable throughout landscapes, so we investigated the potential impacts of environmental factors on adult Ae. aegypti capture rates during a "rear and release" program in California to better understand the relative contributions of true variability in population density across a landscape and trap context. We recorded male and female Ae. aegypti catches from BGS traps, with and without CO2, throughout control sites where no mosquitoes were released and in treatment sites where males infected with Wolbachia were released. BGS trap catches were positively influenced by higher proportions of shade or bushes in the front yard of the premises as well as the presence of potential larval habitats such as subterranean vaults. In contrast, an increase in residential habitat within a 100 m radius of trap locations negatively influenced BGS trap catches. For male Ae. aegypti, increased visual complexity of the trap location positively influenced capture rates, and the presence of yard drains negatively affected catch rates in control sites. Lastly, for BGS traps using CO2, higher catch rates were noted from traps placed greater than one meter from walls or fences for both male and female mosquitoes. These results have important implications for surveillance programs of Ae. aegypti throughout the Californian urban environment including adult monitoring during "rear and release" programs.

TI  - Predicting power outages caused by extratropical storms
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
AB  - Strong winds induced by extratropical storms cause a large number of power outages, especially in highly forested countries such as Finland. Thus, predicting the impact of the storms is one of the key challenges for power grid operators. This article introduces a novel method to predict the storm severity for the power grid employing ERA5 reanalysis data combined with forest inventory. We start by identifying storm objects from wind gust and pressure fields by using contour lines of 15 m s(-1) and 1000 hPa, respectively. The storm objects are then tracked and characterized with features derived from surface weather parameters and forest vegetation information. Finally, objects are classified with a supervised machine-learning method based on how much damage to the power grid they are expected to cause. Random forest classifiers, support vector classifiers, naive Bayes processes, Gaussian processes, and multilayer perceptrons were evaluated for the classification task, with support vector classifiers providing the best results.

TI  - <i>Lutzomyia longipalpis</i> (Diptera: Psychodidae) Argentina-Bolivia border: new report and genetic diversity
T2  - MEMORIAS DO INSTITUTO OSWALDO CRUZ
AB  - American visceral leishmaniasis (AVL) has two main scenarios of transmission as follows: scattered cases in rural areas and urban outbreaks. Urban AVL is in active dispersion from the northeastern border of Argentina-Paraguay-Brazil to the South. The presence of Lutzomyia longipalpis was initially reported in urban environments in the northwestern border of the country. The presence of Lu. longipalpis, environmental variables associated with its distribution, and its genetic diversity were assessed in Salvador Mazza, Argentina, on the border with Bolivia. The genetic analysis showed high haplotype diversity, low nucleotide diversity, and low nucleotide polymorphism index. We discuss the hypothesis of an expanding urban population with introgressive hybridisation of older haplogroups found in their path in natural forest or rural environments, acquiring a new adaptability to urban environments, and the possibility of changes in vector capacity.

TI  - Geographic patterns and environmental factors associated with human yellow fever presence in the Americas
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   In the Americas, yellow fever virus transmission is a latent threat due to the proximity between urban and wild environments. Although yellow fever has nearly vanished from North and Central America, there are still 13 countries in the Americas considered endemic by the World Health Organization. Human cases usually occur as a result of the exposure to sylvatic yellow fever in tropical forested environments; but urban outbreaks reported during the last decade demonstrate that the risk in this environment still exists. The objective of this study was to identify spatial patterns and the relationship between key geographic and environmental factors with the distribution of yellow fever human cases in the Americas.
   Methodology/Principal findings
   An ecological study was carried out to analyze yellow fever human cases reported to the Pan American Health Organization from 2000 to 2014, aggregated by second administrative level subdivisions (counties). Presence of yellow fever by county was used as the outcome variable and eight geo-environmental factors were used as independent variables. Spatial analysis was performed to identify and examine natural settings per county. Subsequently, a multivariable logistic regression model was built. During the study period, 1,164 cases were reported in eight out of the 13 endemic countries. Nearly 83.8% of these cases were concentrated in three countries: Peru (37.4%), Brazil (28.1%) and Colombia (18.4%); and distributed in 57 states/provinces, specifically in 286 counties (3.4% of total counties). Yellow fever presence was significantly associated with altitude, rain, diversity of non-human primate hosts and temperature. A positive spatial autocorrelation revealed a clustered geographic pattern in 138/286 yellow fever positive counties (48.3%).
   Conclusions/Significance
   A clustered geographic pattern of yellow fever was identified mostly along the Andes eastern foothills. This risk map could support health policies in endemic countries. Geo-environmental factors associated with presence of yellow fever could help predict and adjust the limits of other risk areas of epidemiological concern.

TI  - Infection rates in <i>Dipetalogaster maximus</i> (Reduviidae: Triatominae) by <i>Trypanosoma cruzi</i> in the Cape region, Baja California Sur, Mexico
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - Infection rates of Trypanosoma cruzi Chagas (in the blood-sucking bug Dipetalogaster maximus [Uhler]) were determined from specimens collected at 12 localities in the Cape Region of Baja California Sur, Mexico. Eight collection sites were located in the tropical dry forest, two in desert shrub, and two in the ecotone between these two communities. Of the 245 D. maximus collected, 65% were first and second instar nymphs; 32.6% were third, fourth, and fifth instar nymphs; and 2.4% were adults. The highest proportion of specimens came from El Fandango (30%) and San Bartolo (23%) canyons and La Cruz hill (12%) in the mountain slopes facing the Gulf of California. in feces from individual bugs analyzed for T. cruzi, we found an overall infection rate of 7.0%. Infection rates increased from 4.1% in second instars to 42.% in fifth instars. High infection rates were found in bugs collected from La Poza (38.4%), El Gato (27.2%), and El Pedregoso (25%) hills; low infection rates were found in specimens from La Cruz hill and San Bartolo canyon. Specimens from some collection sites were not infected with T. cruzi.

TI  - Human infection with <i>Plasmodium knowlesi </i>on the Laos-Vietnam border
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HEALTH
AB  - Background: Border malaria in the Greater Mekong region of Southeast Asia poses a serious threat to the health of the ethnic minority populations of the region. Traditionally thought to be caused primarily by the malaria parasites Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax, recently a zoonotic parasite, Plasmodium knowlesi, has been identified in some countries of the region. The presence of this parasite poses a challenge to malaria control programmes, as it is maintained in a zoonotic reservoir of forest-dwelling macaque monkeys.
   Methods: A cross-sectional malaria parasite species prevalence survey was conducted along the Laos-Vietnam border in the central part of the two countries. Human blood samples were collected from Savannakhet in Laos and Quang Tri in Vietnam between August and October 2010 and assayed for the presence of human malaria parasite species and P. knowlesi. A PCR targeting the 18S small subunit ribosomal RNA gene and circumsporozoite protein gene was used for Plasmodium species identification.
   Results: Nine cases of P. knowlesi were detected by PCR in blood samples from the Laos side and three from the Vietnam side. All P. knowlesi infections were found in co-infection with P. vivax, with some triple infections of P. knowlesi, P. vivax and P. falciparum detected in Laos. Phylogenetic analysis of these parasites suggests that P. knowlesi is circulating in the Laos-Vietnam border region.
   Conclusion: This report shows that P. knowlesi is transmited on both sides of the Vietnam-Laos border. Continued monitoring of the range and prevalence of P. knowlesi on both the sides of Laos-Vietnam border is of importance to the National Malaria Control Programmes of both countries.

TI  - Prediction of hookworm prevalence in southern India using environmental parameters derived from Landsat 8 remotely sensed data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY
AB  - Soil-transmitted helminth infections propagate poverty and slow economic growth in low-income countries. As with many other neglected tropical diseases, environmental conditions are important determinants of soil-transmitted helminth transmission. Hence, remotely sensed data are commonly utilised in spatial risk models intended to inform control strategies. In the present study, we build upon the existing modelling approaches by utilising fine spatial resolution Landsat 8 remotely sensed data in combination with topographic variables to predict hookworm prevalence in a hilly tribal area in southern India. Hookworm prevalence data collected from two field surveys were used in a random forest model to investigate the predictive capacity of 15 environmental variables derived from two remotely sensed images acquired during dry and rainy seasons. A variable buffer radius (100-1000 m) was applied to the point-prevalence locations in order to integrate environmental conditions around the village centroids into the modelling approach and understand where transmission is more likely. Elevation and slope were the most important variables in the models, with lower elevation and higher slope correlating with higher transmission risk. A modified normalised difference water index was among other recurring important variables, likely responsible for some seasonal differences in model performance. The 300 m buffer distance produced the best model performance in this setting, with another spike at 700 m, and a marked drop-off in R-2 values at 1000 m. In addition to assessing a large number of environmental correlates with hookworm transmission, the study contributes to the development of standardised methods of spatial linkage of continuous environmental data with point-based disease prevalence measures for the purpose of spatially explicit risk profiling.

TI  - Impact of green space connectivity on urban tick presence, density and<i> Borrelia</i> infected ticks in different habitats and seasons in three cities in southern England
T2  - TICKS AND TICK-BORNE DISEASES
AB  - Understanding the effects of local habitat and wider landscape connectivity factors on tick presence, nymph density and Borrelia species (spp.) prevalence in the tick population is important for identifying the public health risk from Lyme borreliosis. This multi-city study collected data in three southern England cities (Bath, Bristol, and Southampton) during spring, summer, and autumn in 2017. Focusing specifically on urban green space used for recreation which were clearly in urbanised areas, 72 locations were sampled. Additionally, geospatial datasets on urban green space coverage within 250 m and 1 km of sampling points, as well as distance to woodland were incorporated into statistical models. Distance to woodland was negatively associated with tick presence and nymph density, particularly during spring and summer. Furthermore, we observed an interaction effect between habitat and season for tick presence and nymph density, with woodland habitat having greater tick presence and nymph density during spring. Borrelia spp. infected Ixodes ricinus were found in woodland, woodland edge and under canopy habitats in Bath and Southampton. Overall Borrelia spp. prevalence in nymphs was 2.8%, similar to wider UK studies assessing prevalence in Ixodes ricinus in rural areas. Bird-related Borrelia genospecies dominated across sites, suggesting bird reservoir hosts may be important in urban green space settings for feeding and infecting ticks. Whilst overall density of infected nymphs across the three cities was low (0.03 per 100 m2), risk should be further investigated by incorporating data on tick bites acquired in urban settings, and subsequent Lyme borreliosis transmission.

TI  - Sexual dimorphism and the effect of wild introgressions on recombination in cassava (<i>Manihot esculenta</i> Crantz) breeding germplasm
T2  - G3-GENES GENOMES GENETICS
AB  - Recombination has essential functions in meiosis, evolution, and breeding. The frequency and distribution of crossovers dictate the generation of new allele combinations and can vary across species and between sexes. Here, we examine recombination landscapes across the 18 chromosomes of cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) with respect to male and female meioses and known introgressions from the wild relative Manihot glaziovii. We used SHAPEIT2 and duoHMM to infer crossovers from genotyping-by-sequencing data and a validated multigenerational pedigree from the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture cassava breeding germplasm consisting of 7020 informative meioses. We then constructed new genetic maps and compared them to an existing map previously constructed by the International Cassava Genetic Map Consortium. We observed higher recombination rates in females compared to males, and lower recombination rates in M. glaziovii introgression segments on chromosomes 1 and 4, with suppressed recombination along the entire length of the chromosome in the case of the chromosome 4 introgression. Finally, we discuss hypothesized mechanisms underlying our observations of heterochiasmy and crossover suppression and discuss the broader implications for plant breeding.

TI  - Apparent Mortality as a Result of an Elevated Parasite Infection in <i>Presbytis rubicunda</i>
T2  - FOLIA PRIMATOLOGICA
AB  - We provide the first parasite assessment of wild red langurs (Presbytis rubicunda). Seven helminth taxa and 4 protozoa were recovered from faecal samples. We report the details of the death of an adult female red langur with potential association of an elevated parasite infection. There is a paucity of published literature on red langurs and nothing is known of the factors affecting interspecific parasite transmission and disease spread between other primate species. Parasites may be substantial determinants of host health and may present a significant influence on the survival and reproduction of individuals and the subsequent fecundity of populations. Further research into the connection of parasite burden with individual deaths and potential population declines is recommended for monitoring population health. (C) 2014 S. Karger AG, Basel

TI  - Nile Tilapia, <i>Oreochromis niloticus</i> (Teleostei: Cichlidae): a threat to native fishes of Lake Malawi?
T2  - BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS
AB  - The Nile Tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus, is a freshwater cichlid indigenous to the tropical and subtropical parts of the eastern and western Africa and is being cultured in the Lake Malawi catchment on the Tanzanian side. Historically, the Nile Tilapia has been successful in dispersing once it has been introduced into a catchment area. The probability of the Nile Tilapia successfully colonizing Lake Malawi is enhanced by many of its life history attributes including its fast growth rate, large size relative to native Oreochromis spp., and its diverse repertoire of feeding options. Where introduced, Nile Tilapia has had devastating impacts through competition or hybridization with native congenerics. We contend that the Nile Tilapia is a significant threat to the native fishes of Lake Malawi. With Lake Malawi harboring more species of fishes than any other freshwater lake in the world, a loss of species diversity due to the introduction of Nile Tilapia would be catastrophic for this unique system. Native fishes that in recent years provided 70% of the animal protein consumed in the country would be threatened by the colonization of the Nile Tilapia. We are convinced that should the Nile Tilapia become established in Lake Malawi it would (1) Cause the extirpation/extinction of native fishes, (2) Hybridize with endemic Oreochromis spp., and (3) Damage the livelihoods of existing artisanal fishermen.

TI  - Could a rabies incursion spread in the northern Australian dingo population? Development of a spatial stochastic simulation model
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Australia, home to the iconic dingo, is currently free from canine rabies. However northern Australia, including Indigenous communities with large free-roaming domestic dog populations, is at increased risk of rabies incursion from nearby Indonesia. We developed a novel agent-based stochastic spatial rabies spread model to evaluate the potential spread of rabies within the dingo population of the Northern Peninsula Area (NPA) region of northern Australia. The model incorporated spatio-temporal features specific to this host-environment system, including landscape heterogeneity, demographic fluctuations, dispersal movements and dingo ecological parameters-such as home range size and density-derived from NPA field studies. Rabies spread between dingo packs in nearly 60% of simulations. In such situations rabies would affect a median of 22 dingoes (approximately 14% of the population; 2.5-97.5 percentiles: 2-101 dingoes) within the study area which covered 1,131 km(2), and spread 0.52 km/week for 191 days. Larger outbreaks occurred in scenarios in which an incursion was introduced during the dry season (vs. wet season), and close to communities (vs. areas with high risk of interaction between dingoes and hunting community dogs). Sensitivity analyses revealed that home range size and duration of infectious clinical period contributed most to the variance of outputs. Although conditions in the NPA would most likely not support a sustained propagation of the disease in the dingo population, due to the predicted number of infected dingoes following a rabies incursion and the proximity of Indigenous communities to dingo habitat, we conclude that the risk for human transmission could be substantial.
   Author summary
   Although Australia is free from canine rabies, an incursion from nearby rabies-infected Indonesian islands is a realistic threat. The ubiquitous presence of dingoes in the wild, in association with large populations of free-roaming domestic dogs from northern Australian Indigenous communities, increases the risk of a rabies outbreak. Using a newly developed simulation model, we investigated the potential spread of rabies in a northern Australian dingo population. Nearly 60% of model simulations resulted in more than one pack infected. When spread did occur, outbreaks affected a median of 22 dingoes (an estimated 14% of the population in this area). The duration of infection, proportion of the population infected and spatial spread of the outbreak was greatest when rabies was introduced during the dry season and close to communities. Our results demonstrate that an incursion of rabies into the northern Australian dingo population would likely lead to a rabies outbreak, which would in turn pose a substantial threat to Indigenous communities in northern Australia.

TI  - A new species of <i>Trichuris</i> Roederer, 1761 (Nematoda: Trichuridae) from <i>Heteromys gaumeri</i> Allen & Chapman (Rodentia: Heteromyidae) in Yucatan, Mexico
T2  - SYSTEMATIC PARASITOLOGY
AB  - In Mexico, four species of Trichuris Roederer, 1761 have been recorded in wild rodents belonging to the family Heteromyidae. In the present paper, we describe a new species based on specimens collected from Heteromys gaumeri Allen & Chapman (Heteromyidae: Heteromyinae) in the tropical forests of the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico. Trichuris silviae n. sp. can be differentiated from the congeners described in North and South American rodents by morphological and morphometric features, such as the possession of a wide spicular tube, a thicker proximal cloacal tube, a shorter distal cloacal tube and a cylindrical spicular sheath. This is the first description of a Trichuris spp. from heteromyid rodents in Mexico and the fourth in North America. Despite the broad distribution of Heteromys spp., few cases of Trichuris infection have been reported. Further studies are necessary to verify if the new species is present in other heteromyid rodents in order to increase our knowledge about its geographical and host distribution.

TI  - Initiation and spread of traveling waves of plague, <i>Yersinia pestis</i>, in the western United States
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Yersinia pestis invaded the continental United States in 1900 and subsequently became established in wild rodent populations in several western states, traversing 2,250 km ill approximately 40 years. However, the specific path of the eastward expansion of plague into the United States is poorly understood. We directly calculated velocities of disease spread and performed trend-surface analyses on spatio-temporally unique plague cases to clarify the route and speed of the initial spread of plague eastward. Velocities of disease spread were then analyzed using multiple linear regression models to identify environmental features that significantly impacted the rate of spread. Between one and three introductions of plague along the Pacific coast were observed, after which plague traveled from 45 to 87 km/year. In all regression models, the coast ranges of California were associated with slower spread, and the Southern Rockies were associated with a significant increase in the rate of disease spread. Additional climatic and environmental factors affecting the velocity of plague's spread varied among the models. Maps were developed to graphically represent the traveling waves of plague over the United States landscape. These analyses identify important large-scale trends regarding the eastward invasion of plague into the continental United States that can be used to better understand the historical spread of plague, as well as how to manage threats from new or re-emerging diseases that might operate under similar spatio-temporal dynamics.

TI  - Plant Dispersal, Introduced Species, and Vegetation Change in the South Pacific Kingdom of Tonga
T2  - PACIFIC SCIENCE
AB  - Dispersal guilds hold key ecological implications for the vegetation history of islands. This study considers dispersal vectors in conjunction with species origin and growth form to characterize vegetation dynamics on the islands of Tonga in the South Pacific. Data for over 700 species compiled from published literature on the plants of Tonga support a comparative study of dispersal mechanisms and growth forms for native flora, species brought by Polynesian settlers, and taxa introduced since European contact. The indigenous flora, predominantly trees, is characterized primarily by endozoochorous (internal) dispersal through birds and bats. European introductions, primarily herbs, disperse commonly through epizoochorous (external) animal dispersal. Bat dispersal is most important for overstory indigenous and Polynesian trees and vines. In addition, rodents commonly eat seeds of native rain forest trees. The understory, which is overwhelmingly introduced, consists of wind-dispersed and externally animal-dispersed species, which are often early successional. Rain forest thinning encourages establishment of wind-dispersed species and nonnatives. Thus, the prospect of sustained native flora in Tonga would be enhanced by the preservation of bats, a particularly important dispersal vector for indigenous and endemic species, and by the eradication of introduced rats.

TI  - Electrospray mass-spectrometry guided target isolation of neolignans from <i>Nectandra leucantha</i> (Lauraceae) by high performance- and spiral-coil countercurrent chromatography
T2  - JOURNAL OF CHROMATOGRAPHY A
AB  - Nectandra leucantha (Lauraceae) is a tree indigenous to the tropical Atlantic forests of Brazil, one of the most biodiverse flora hotspots worldwide. This plant species contains high concentrations of neolignan and dehydrodieugenol derivatives that express significant in-vitro activities against various parasite strains. These activities are however responsible for severe tropical human infections, such as Leishmaniasis (Leishmania spp.) and Chagas disease (Trypanosoma cruzi), which have been classified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs). In order to optimize the isolation process for these target metabolites, n-hexane extract of the leaves was separated by means of semi-preparative high performance countercurrent chromatography (HPCCC) and scale-up spiral-coil countercurrent chromatography (sp-CCC) systems. Several biphasic solvent mixtures were evaluated for their partitioning effects on neolignans, resulting in the selection of an optimized system n-hexane - ethylacetate - methanol - water (7:3:7:3, v/v/v/v). The chromatographic experiments on the HPCCC and sp-CCC were run in the head-to-tail mode with 500 mg and 16 g injections, respectively. For specific and multiple metabolite detection, the recovered CCC-fractions were off-line injected, in the sequence of recovery, to an electrospray mass-spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) device. A projection of the single ion traces of the target compounds, in the positive ionization mode at a scan range of m/z 100-1500, located chromatographic areas where the co-elution effects occurred and pure target metabolites were present. Five major target neolignans were specifically detected, which enabled the accurate pooling of CCC-fractions for an optimum recovery of the metabolites. The direct comparison of the performance characteristics of the two CCC-devices, with very different mechanical designs was achieved by the conversion of the time axis into a partition ratio (K-D) separation scale. As a result, the compound specific K-D-elution values of the target neolignan were determined in high precision, while the comparison of the calculated separation factor (alpha) and resolution factor (R-s) values revealed a superior separation performance for the HPCCC system. Also, the reproducibility of detected metabolites in the two CCC experiments was confirmed by small variations (Delta K-D +/- 0.1). Neolignan target compounds with anti-parasite activities were successfully isolated in the 100 mg to 4 g range in a single lab-scale countercurrent chromatographic process step.

T2  - REVISTA DA SOCIEDADE BRASILEIRA DE MEDICINA TROPICAL
AB  - Introduction: Rhodnius domesticus Neiva & Pinto, 1923 is a rare sylvatic triatomine endemic to the Atlantic Forest, with one known record for Espirito Santo (ES), Brazil from 1969. We present here its rediscovery in ES, 42 years after its first record. Methods: In January 2011, a triatomine specimen was collected from a rural area of the municipality of Santa Teresa, ES. Results: We confirmed this as a new record of R. domesticus in the Baixo Caldeirao locality. Conclusions: This finding supports the possibility of a wild population of R. domesticus in the mountainous region of the Atlantic forest of ES.

TI  - Partnerships for better neglected disease drug discovery and development: how have we fared?
T2  - EXPERT OPINION ON DRUG DISCOVERY
AB  - Introduction: In the field of neglected disease, mushrooming partnerships have changed the landscape in the last decades. With high diversity in participants, type, scope, and operational models, partnership becomes the ultimate choice for drug discovery and development. This paper aims to reflect on this phenomenon based on experiences and lessons learned, providing insights for the future. Areas covered: Lack of safe and effective drugs for neglected diseases stems from market and public policy failure. Combining resources, skills, and expertise justifies working collaboratively in the R&D quest. The advancement of public-private partnerships (PPP), including product development partnership (PDP) for neglected diseases, is described, herein, including the rationale behind their conception, evolution, expansion, and alternative approaches. The author also discusses the appeals and the pitfalls of partnership in this field. Expert opinion: The progressive partnerships in drug discovery and development for neglected diseases need to be encouraged, especially in alignment with an open science culture. Experiences in partnerships vary with bias for successful ones, rendering more rigorous evaluation and research necessary. Eventually, the focus of improving partnership should not only be on addressing discovery bottlenecks, but also safeguarding access and delivery. Expanding focus to include vaccines and diagnostics is necessary.

TI  - Ethanolic extract <i>Ocimum sanctum Linn</i>. induces an apoptosis in human lung adenocarcinoma (A549) cells
T2  - HELIYON
AB  - Ocimum sanctum (OS) is tropical herbal plant which is easy to find and widely used as a vegetable food in Indonesia. In last decade, lung adenocarcinoma was in top position as male cancer disease in Indonesia. Recently, emerging data showing the extracts of different species of Ocimum exhibiting the anti-tumor properties. Further studies on lung lewis carcinoma demonstrated pro-apoptosis effects after the treatment with Ocimum extracts. However, the effect of OS of Indonesian origin in human alveolar pulmonary adenocarcinoma A549 cells remain unclear. Therefore, we aimed to investigate effects of ethanolic extract OS (EEOS) in A549 cell culture systems. Cell adhesion and viability assays revealed that EEOS significantly decreased the attachment into extracellular matrix of A549 cells. Morphological examination AO/EB and DAPI staining indicated that EEOS induced the cells shrinkage, DNA fragmentation and condensation of A549 cells. Further, EEOS treatment induced the apoptosis rate followed by up-regulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), caspase-3 expression and decreased antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2. This condition also suppressed the expression of SOD2 as well as the GPx. In conclusion, our findings indicate that EEOS suppressed the viability of A549 cells, which may result from the activation of ROS promoting the apoptosis signaling via mitochondrial intrinsic pathway. Taken together, EEOS might be a good therapeutic potential to further understand its properties in the treatment of lung carcinoma.

TI  - Mitochondrial DNA Detects a Complex Evolutionary History with Pleistocene Epoch Divergence for the Neotropical Malaria Vector <i>Anopheles nuneztovari</i> Sensu Lato
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Cryptic species and lineages characterize Anopheles nuneztovari s.l. Gabaldon, an important malaria vector in South America. We investigated the phylogeographic structure across the range of this species with cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COO mitochondrial DNA sequences to estimate the number of clades and levels of divergence. Bayesian and maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analyses detected four groups distributed in two major monophyletic clades (I and II). Samples from the Amazon Basin were clustered in clade I, as were subclades II-A and II-B, whereas those from Bolivia/Colombia/Venezuela were restricted to one basal subclade (II-C). These data, together with a statistical parsimony network, confirm results of previous studies that An. nuneztovari is a species complex consisting of at least two cryptic taxa, one occurring in Colombia and Venezuela and the another occurring in the Amazon Basin. These data also suggest that additional incipient species may exist in the Amazon Basin. Divergence time and expansion tests suggested that these groups separated and expanded in the Pleistocene Epoch. In addition, the COI sequences clearly separated An. nuneztovari s.l. from the closely related species An. dunhami Causey, and three new records are reported for An. dunhami in Amazonian Brazil. These findings are relevant for vector control programs in areas where both species occur. Our analyses support dynamic geologic and landscape changes in northern South America, and infer particularly active divergence during the Pleistocene Epoch for New World anophelines.

TI  - Hydrological connectivity and <i>Burkholderia pseudomallei</i> prevalence in wetland environments: investigating rice-farming community's risk of exposure to melioidosis in North-East Thailand
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
AB  - In our analysis of 136 water samples from wetland environments (rice paddies, natural wetland sites, man-made water bodies) in rural areas of North-East Thailand, Burkholderia pseudomallei was most prevalent in rice paddies (15 of the 30 positive sites). The high prevalence in the water of rice fields is indicative of the inherent vulnerability of farmers in rural agricultural areas in this area of Thailand and likely other locations in the tropics. Nearly all B. pseudomallei-positive sites were found within the vicinity of a large wetland associated with the Chi River, in the month of July 2014. Positive samples were found in water ranging in pH from 5.9 to 8.7, salinity ranging from 0.04 to 1.58 ppt, nitrate ranging from 0 to 10.8 ppm, and iron ranging from 0.003 to 1.519 ppm. Of these variables, only iron content was statistically higher in B. pseudomallei-positive versus B. pseudomallei-negative sites, suggesting that increasing concentrations of iron may encourage the growth of this bacterium, which is responsible for melioidosis. Our results, when combined with data from other published studies, support the notion that B. pseudomallei can exist in a wide range of environmental conditions. Thus, we argue that health safety education is a more appropriate means of addressing farmer vulnerability than chemical or physical alterations to fields at large scales. Further, it may be important to investigate melioidosis through transdisciplinary approaches that consider the complex social and ecological contexts in which the disease occurs.

TI  - Limited diversity of <i>Anopheles darlingi</i> in the peruvian Amazon region of Iquitos
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Anopheles darlingi is the most important malaria vector in the Amazon basin of South America, and is capable of transmitting both Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax. To understand the genetic structure of this vector in the Amazonian region of Peru, a simple polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based test to identify this species of mosquito was used. A random amplified polymorphic DNA-PCR was used to study genetic variation at the micro-geographic level in nine geographically separate populations of An. darlingi collected in areas with different degrees of deforestation surrounding the city of Iquitos. Within-population genetic diversity in nine populations, as quantified by the expected heterozygosity (H,), ranged from 0.27 to 0.32. Average genetic distance (F-ST) among these populations was 0.017. These results show that the nine studied populations are highly homogeneous, suggesting that strategies can be developed to combat this malaria vector as a single epidemiologic unit.

TI  - The legacy effects of rubber defoliation period on the refoliation phenology, leaf disease, and latex yield
T2  - PLANT DIVERSITY
AB  - The leaf phenology of trees has received particular attention for its crucial role in the global water and carbon balances, ecosystem, and species distribution. However, current studies on leaf phenology have mainly focused on temperate trees, while few studies including tropical trees. Little attention has been paid to globally extensive industrial plantations. Rubber plantations are important to both the local and global economies. In this study, we investigated the legacy effects of defoliation phenology on the following year's leaf flushing, leaf disease, and also latex yield of rubber trees, an economically important tree to local people and the world. Results show that extended duration of defoliation increased the subsequent duration of refoliation and rates of infection by powdery mildew disease, but led to reduced latex yield in March. This legacy effect of rubber defoliation may relate to the carbohydrate reserved in the trees. A longer duration of defoliation would consume more reserved carbohydrates, reducing available reserves for disease defense and latex production. Extended duration of defoliation period was associated with either a lower temperature before the cessation of latex tapping in October-November and/or a higher temperature after the cessation of latex tapping in December-January. Leaf falling signals the end of photosynthetic activities in deciduous trees. Thus, the leaf falling phenology will impact ecological processes involving rubber trees. Our findings indicated that the inclusion of defoli-ation periods in future rubber trees' research, will be crucial to furthering our understanding of leaf flushing, powdery mildew disease, and latex yield.Copyright (c) 2023 Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

TI  - <i>Litomosoides</i> Microfilaria in Seven Neotropical Bat Species
T2  - JOURNAL OF PARASITOLOGY
AB  - Litomosoides spp. (Nematoda: Filarioidea: Onchocercidae) are of great interest for understanding dynamics of zoonoses because of their similarity to human-infecting filariae (e.g., Onchocerca volvulus). We encountered Litomosoides microfilaria in blood samples from 7 Panamanian bat species. Species were identified through morphological analysis. We assessed individual traits and immune response of the host individuals as well as host species ecology. We found 8 host-specific species/morphotypes of Litomosoides microfilariae in 5 bat species, with 5 individuals showing multiple infections. Our study includes the first records of Litomosoides brasiliensis in Artibeus jamaicensis and of Litomosoides-like and Litomosa-like microfilaria in Lophostoma silvicolum. Multiple binary regression analysis showed that the presence of specific Litomosoides species was influenced by host species, sex, and reproductive status.

TI  - An Epidemic of Dengue-1 in a Remote Village in Rural Laos
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - In the Lao PDR (Laos), urban dengue is an increasingly recognised public health problem. We describe a dengue-1 virus outbreak in a rural northwestern Lao forest village during the cool season of 2008. The isolated strain was genotypically "endemic" and not "sylvatic," belonging to the genotype 1, Asia 3 clade. Phylogenetic analyses of 37 other dengue-1 sequences from diverse areas of Laos between 2007 and 2010 showed that the geographic distribution of some strains remained focal overtime while others were dispersed throughout the country. Evidence that dengue viruses have broad circulation in the region, crossing country borders, was also obtained. Whether the outbreak arose from dengue importation from an urban centre into a dengue-naive community or crossed into the village from a forest cycle is unknown. More epidemiological and entomological investigations are required to understand dengue epidemiology and the importance of rural and forest dengue dynamics in Laos.

TI  - Discovery of genomic intervals that underlie nematode responses to benzimidazoles
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Parasitic nematodes impose a debilitating health and economic burden across much of the world. Nematode resistance to anthelmintic drugs threatens parasite control efforts in both human and veterinary medicine. Despite this threat, the genetic landscape of potential resistance mechanisms to these critical drugs remains largely unexplored. Here, we exploit natural variation in the model nematodes Caenorhabditis elegans and Caenorhabditis briggsae to discover quantitative trait loci (QTL) that control sensitivity to benzimidazoles widely used in human and animal medicine. High-throughput phenotyping of albendazole, fenbendazole, mebendazole, and thiabendazole responses in panels of recombinant lines led to the discovery of over 15 QTL in C. elegans and four QTL in C. briggsae associated with divergent responses to these anthelmintics. Many of these QTL are conserved across benzimidazole derivatives, but others show drug and dose specificity. We used near-isogenic lines to recapitulate and narrow the C. elegans albendazole QTL of largest effect and identified candidate variants correlated with the resistance phenotype. These QTL do not overlap with known benzimidazole target resistance genes from parasitic nematodes and present specific new leads for the discovery of novel mechanisms of nematode benzimidazole resistance. Analyses of orthologous genes reveal conservation of candidate benzimidazole resistance genes in medically important parasitic nematodes. These data provide a basis for extending these approaches to other anthelmintic drug classes and a pathway towards validating new markers for anthelmintic resistance that can be deployed to improve parasite disease control.

TI  - <i>Rhipicephalus</i> Tick: A Contextual Review for Southeast Asia
T2  - PATHOGENS
AB  - Rhipicephalus species are distributed globally with a notifiable presence in Southeast Asia (SEA) within animal and human populations. The Rhipicephalus species are highly adaptive and have established successful coexistence within human dwellings and are known to be active all year round, predominantly in tropical and subtropical climates existing in SEA. In this review, the morphological characteristics, epidemiology, and epizootiology of Rhipicephalus tick species found in SEA are reviewed. There are six commonly reported Rhipicephalus ticks in the SEA region. Their interactions with their host species that range from cattle, sheep, and goats, through cats and dogs, to rodents and man are discussed in this article. Rhipicephalus-borne pathogens, including Anaplasma species, Ehrlichia species, Babesia species, and Theileria species, have been highlighted as are relevant to the region in review. Pathogens transmitted from Rhipicepahalus ticks to host animals are usually presented clinically with signs of anemia, jaundice, and other signs of hemolytic changes. Rhipicephalus ticks infestation also account for ectoparasitic nuisance in man and animals. These issues are discussed with specific interest to the SEA countries highlighting peculiarities of the region in the epidemiology of Rhipicephalus species and attendant pathogens therein. This paper also discusses the current general control strategies for ticks in SEA proffering measures required for increased documentation. The potential risks associated with rampant and improper acaricide use are highlighted. Furthermore, such practices lead to acaricide resistance among Rhipicephalus species are highlighted.

TI  - Folding of the Ig-Like Domain of the Dengue Virus Envelope Protein Analyzed by High-Hydrostatic-Pressure NMR at a Residue-Level Resolution
T2  - BIOMOLECULES
AB  - Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne endemic disease in tropical and subtropical regions, causing a significant public health problem in Southeast Asia. Domain III (ED3) of the viral envelope protein contains the two dominant putative epitopes and part of the heparin sulfate receptor binding region that drives the dengue virus (DENV)'s fusion with the host cell. Here, we used high-hydrostatic-pressure nuclear magnetic resonance (HHP-NMR) to obtain residue-specific information on the folding process of domain III from serotype 4 dengue virus (DEN4-ED3), which adopts the classical three-dimensional (3D) ss-sandwich structure known as the Ig-like fold. Interestingly, the folding pathway of DEN4-ED3 shares similarities with that of the Titin I27 module, which also adopts an Ig-like fold, but is functionally unrelated to ED3. For both proteins, the unfolding process starts by the disruption of the N- and C-terminal strands on one edge of the ss-sandwich, yielding a folding intermediate stable over a substantial pressure range (from 600 to 1000 bar). In contrast to this similarity, pressure-jump kinetics indicated that the folding transition state is considerably more hydrated in DEN4-ED3 than in Titin I27.

AB  - Tsetse flies transmit trypanosomes, the causative agent of human and animal African trypanosomiasis. The tsetse vector is extensively distributed across sub-Saharan Africa. Trypanosomiasis maintenance is determined by the interrelationship of three elements: vertebrate host, parasite and the vector responsible for transmission. Mapping the distribution and abundance of tsetse flies assists in predicting trypanosomiasis distributions and developing rational strategies for disease and vector control. Given scarce resources to carry out regular full scale field tsetse surveys to up-date existing tsetse maps, there is a need to devise inexpensive means for regularly obtaining dependable area-wide tsetse data to guide control activities. In this study we used spatial epidemiological modelling techniques (logistic regression) involving 5000 field-based tsetse-data (G.f.fuscipes) points over an area of 40,000 km(2), with satellite-derived environmental surrogates composed of precipitation, temperature, land cover, normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) and elevation at the sub-national level. We used these extensive tsetse data to analyse the relationships between presence of tsetse (G.f.fuscipes) and environmental variables. The strength of the results was enhanced through the application of a spatial autologistic regression model (SARM). Using the SARM we showed that the probability of tsetse presence increased with proportion of forest cover and riverine vegetation. The key outputs are a predictive tsetse distribution map for the Lake Victoria basin of Uganda and an improved understanding of the association between tsetse presence and environmental variables. The predicted spatial distribution of tsetse in the Lake Victoria basin of Uganda will provide significant new information to assist with the spatial targeting of tsetse and trypanosomiasis control.

TI  - Vector Competence of New Zealand Mosquitoes for Selected Arboviruses
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - New Zealand (NZ) historically has been free of arboviral activity with the exception of Whataroa virus (Togaviridae: Alphavirus), which is established in bird populations and is transmitted by local mosquitoes. This naive situation is threatened by global warming, invasive mosquitoes, and tourism. To determine the threat of selected medically important arboviruses to NZ, vector competence assays were conducted using field collected endemic and introduced mosquito species. Four alphaviruses (Togaviridae): Barmah Forest virus, Chikungunya virus, Ross River virus, and Sindbis virus, and five flaviviruses (Flaviviridae): Dengue virus 2, Japanese encephalitis virus, Murray Valley encephalitis virus, West Nile virus, and Yellow fever virus were evaluated. Results indicate some NZ mosquito species are highly competent vectors of selected arboviruses, particularly alphaviruses, and may pose a threat were one of these arboviruses introduced at a time when the vector was prevalent and the climatic conditions favorable for virus transmission.

TI  - Years lived with disability (YLDs) for 1160 sequelae of 289 diseases and injuries 1990-2010: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010
T2  - LANCET
AB  - Background Non-fatal health outcomes from diseases and injuries are a crucial consideration in the promotion and monitoring of individual and population health. The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) studies done in 1990 and 2000 have been the only studies to quantify non-fatal health outcomes across an exhaustive set of disorders at the global and regional level. Neither effort quantified uncertainty in prevalence or years lived with disability (YLDs).
   Methods Of the 291 diseases and injuries in the GBD cause list, 289 cause disability. For 1160 sequelae of the 289 diseases and injuries, we undertook a systematic analysis of prevalence, incidence, remission, duration, and excess mortality. Sources included published studies, case notification, population-based cancer registries, other disease registries, antenatal clinic serosurveillance, hospital discharge data, ambulatory care data, household surveys, other surveys, and cohort studies. For most sequelae, we used a Bayesian meta-regression method, DisMod-MR, designed to address key limitations in descriptive epidemiological data, including missing data, inconsistency, and large methodological variation between data sources. For some disorders, we used natural history models, geospatial models, back-calculation models (models calculating incidence from population mortality rates and case fatality), or registration completeness models (models adjusting for incomplete registration with health-system access and other covariates). Disability weights for 220 unique health states were used to capture the severity of health loss. YLDs by cause at age, sex, country, and year levels were adjusted for comorbidity with simulation methods. We included uncertainty estimates at all stages of the analysis.
   Findings Global prevalence for all ages combined in 2010 across the 1160 sequelae ranged from fewer than one case per 1 million people to 350 000 cases per 1 million people. Prevalence and severity of health loss were weakly correlated (correlation coefficient -0.37). In 2010, there were 777 million YLDs from all causes, up from 583 million in 1990. The main contributors to global YLDs were mental and behavioural disorders, musculoskeletal disorders, and diabetes or endocrine diseases. The leading specific causes of YLDs were much the same in 2010 as they were in 1990: low back pain, major depressive disorder, iron-deficiency anaemia, neck pain, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, anxiety disorders, migraine, diabetes, and falls. Age-specific prevalence of YLDs increased with age in all regions and has decreased slightly from 1990 to 2010. Regional patterns of the leading causes of YLDs were more similar compared with years of life lost due to premature mortality. Neglected tropical diseases, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, and anaemia were important causes of YLDs in sub-Saharan Africa.
   Interpretation Rates of YLDs per 100 000 people have remained largely constant over time but rise steadily with age. Population growth and ageing have increased YLD numbers and crude rates over the past two decades. Prevalences of the most common causes of YLDs, such as mental and behavioural disorders and musculoskeletal disorders, have not decreased. Health systems will need to address the needs of the rising numbers of individuals with a range of disorders that largely cause disability but not mortality. Quantification of the burden of non-fatal health outcomes will be crucial to understand how well health systems are responding to these challenges. Effective and affordable strategies to deal with this rising burden are an urgent priority for health systems in most parts of the world.

TI  - Predicting global climatic suitability for the four most invasive anuran species using ecological niche factor analysis
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - Invasive species have a massive impact on their environment and predicting geographical zones at risk of invasion is paramount to the control of further invasions. Invasive anurans are particularly detrimental to native amphibian species, other vertebrates, and even aquaculture through competition, predation, disease transmission, toxicity, or a combination of these. Four species have been designated as the worst anuran invaders worldwide: Duttaphrynus melanostictus, Rhinella marina, Lithobates catesbeianus and Xenopus laevis. In this study, we modelled global habitat suitability for all four species using ecological niche factor analysis (ENFA) to predict the most susceptible areas to invasion. Models showed suitable climatic conditions for all four species expanded beyond their current native and invasive ranges. Tropical, subtropical, and island biomes around the world were among the areas with the highest ENFA suitability for all four species. Further, marginality statistics indicate niche expansion in D. melanostictus, and generalism in the three other species. As only climatic variables were used in the modelling, these results show the ultimate distributions if all landscape conditions are met without significant barriers to invasion.

TI  - Distribution modeling for predicting habitat suitability for citron<i> (Citrus</i><i> medica</i> L.) under climate change scenarios
T2  - FLORA
AB  - Citron (Citrus medica) is one of the major citrus fruits of commerce. It is cultivated mostly in the warm temperate Mediterranean coastal region, and in the tropical and subtropical regions of South and Southeast Asia. It also grows naturally in northeast India, Myanmar, and Yunnan (China). Citron populations are declining in their natural habitats due to forest degradation and change in land use patterns. To predict the habitat suitability for citron, we evaluated four widely used species distribution models (SDMs), namely Generalized Linear Models (GLM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) in 'sdm' package. Based on Area under ROC Curve (AUC; >0.97) and True Skill Statistics (TSS; >0.9) of all four models, an ensemble modeling was carried out using 111 geo-referenced datasets and 19 bioclimatic and three topographic variables under three climate change scenarios (current, 2050 and 2070). Precipitation of warmest quarter (bio18, 69.6%), elevation (11.1%), mean temperature of wettest quarter (bio8, 10.6%), and temperature sea-sonality (bio4, 10.1%) were the most important environmental variables for determining the distribution of citron in the study area. Potentially suitable habitat for citron was predicted to occur from 12 - 29 degrees N to 79 - 108 degrees E. The total suitable habitat covers about 875,868 km2, including 195,846 km2, 274,386 km2, and 405,636 km2, representing high, moderate, and least suitable areas, respectively. Increase in habitat suitability was predicted for 2050 and 2070 under four representative concentration pathways (RCPs), i. e., RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5. This study predicted that northeast India and northern Myanmar would remain moderately or highly suitable for citron.

TI  - Combining Climatic Projections and Dispersal Ability: A Method for Estimating the Responses of Sandfly Vector Species to Climate Change
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background: In the Old World, sandfly species of the genus Phlebotomus are known vectors of Leishmania, Bartonella and several viruses. Recent sandfly catches and autochthonous cases of leishmaniasis hint on spreading tendencies of the vectors towards Central Europe. However, studies addressing potential future distribution of sandflies in the light of a changing European climate are missing.
   Methodology: Here, we modelled bioclimatic envelopes using MaxEnt for five species with proven or assumed vector competence for Leishmania infantum, which are either predominantly located in (south-) western (Phlebotomus ariasi, P. mascittii and P. perniciosus) or south-eastern Europe (P. neglectus and P. perfiliewi). The determined bioclimatic envelopes were transferred to two climate change scenarios (A1B and B1) for Central Europe (Austria, Germany and Switzerland) using data of the regional climate model COSMO-CLM. We detected the most likely way of natural dispersal ("least-cost path") for each species and hence determined the accessibility of potential future climatically suitable habitats by integrating landscape features, projected changes in climatic suitability and wind speed.
   Results and Relevance: Results indicate that the Central European climate will become increasingly suitable especially for those vector species with a current south-western focus of distribution. In general, the highest suitability of Central Europe is projected for all species in the second half of the 21st century, except for P. perfiliewi. Nevertheless, we show that sandflies will hardly be able to occupy their climatically suitable habitats entirely, due to their limited natural dispersal ability. A northward spread of species with south-eastern focus of distribution may be constrained but not completely avoided by the Alps. Our results can be used to install specific monitoring systems to the projected risk zones of potential sandfly establishment. This is urgently needed for adaptation and coping strategies against the emerging spread of sandfly-borne diseases.

TI  - Leishmaniasis sand fly vector density reduction is less marked in destitute housing after insecticide thermal fogging
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
AB  - Background: Insecticide thermal fogging (ITF) is a tool to control vector borne diseases. Insecticide application success for vector control has been associated with housing materials and architecture. Vector abundance is correlated with weather changes. Nevertheless, housing quality and weather impacts on vector abundance have been unaccounted for in most New World insecticide control trials for leishmaniasis vectors.
   Methods: We conducted a 15 month insecticide control trial that included two deltamethrin [6 mg a.i.m(-2)] based ITF interventions in 12 of 24 monitored houses at Trinidad de Las Minas, a hyperendemic cutaneous leishmaniasis transmission village in western Panama. During the study we followed sand fly (SF) abundance, keeping track of rainfall and quantified housing quality using an index based on architecture and construction materials.
   Results: We found a 50 to 80% reduction in SF density in the fogged houses when compared with control houses, while controlling for seasonal changes in SF abundance associated with rainfall. We found heterogeneities in the reductions, as abundance changed according to SF species: Lutzomyia gomezi, Lu. panamensis, Lu. dysponeta and Lu. triramula reduced in density between 40% and 90% after ITF. In contrast, Lu. trapidoi density increased 5% after ITF. Differences in the impact of ITF were associated with housing quality, the most destitute houses, i.e., those with features that ease insect entrance, had a disproportionally larger SF abundance, in some cases with increased domiciliary SF density following the ITF.
   Conclusion: Our results suggest the potential of insecticide application to control SF density and leishmaniasis transmission could depend on housing quality beyond insecticide efficiency.

TI  - No silver bullet for digital soil mapping: country-specific soil organic carbon estimates across Latin America
T2  - SOIL
AB  - Country-specific soil organic carbon (SOC) estimates are the baseline for the Global SOC Map of the Global Soil Partnership (GSOCmap-GSP). This endeavor is key to explaining the uncertainty of global SOC estimates but requires harmonizing heterogeneous datasets and building country-specific capacities for digital soil mapping (DSM). We identified country-specific predictors for SOC and tested the performance of five predictive algorithms for mapping SOC across Latin America. The algorithms included support vector machines (SVMs), random forest (RF), kernel-weighted nearest neighbors (KK), partial least squares regression (PL), and regression kriging based on stepwise multiple linear models (RK). Country-specific training data and SOC predictors (5 x 5 km pixel resolution) were obtained from ISRIC - World Soil Information. Temperature, soil type, vegetation indices, and topographic constraints were the best predictors for SOC, but country-specific predictors and their respective weights varied across Latin America. We compared a large diversity of country-specific datasets and models, and were able to explain SOC variability in a range between similar to 1 and similar to 60 %, with no universal predictive algorithm among countries. A regional (n = 11 268 SOC estimates) ensemble of these five algorithms was able to explain similar to 39 % of SOC variability from repeated 5-fold cross-validation. We report a combined SOC stock of 77.8 +/- 43.6 Pg (uncertainty represented by the full conditional response of independent model residuals) across Latin America. SOC stocks were higher in tropical forests (30 +/- 16.5 Pg) and croplands (13 +/- 8.1 Pg). Country-specific and regional ensembles revealed spatial discrepancies across geopolitical borders, higher elevations, and coastal plains, but provided similar regional stocks (77.8 +/- 42.2 and 76.8 +/- 45.1 Pg, respectively). These results are conservative compared to global estimates (e.g., SoilGrids250m 185.8 Pg, the Harmonized World Soil Database 138.4 Pg, or the GSOCmap-GSP 99.7 Pg). Countries with large area (i.e., Brazil, Bolivia, Mexico, Peru) and large spatial SOC heterogeneity had lower SOC stocks per unit area and larger uncertainty in their predictions. We highlight that expert opinion is needed to set boundary prediction limits to avoid unrealistically high modeling estimates. For maximizing explained variance while minimizing prediction bias, the selection of predictive algorithms for SOC mapping should consider density of available data and variability of country-specific environmental gradients. This study highlights the large degree of spatial uncertainty in SOC estimates across Latin America. We provide a framework for improving country-specific mapping efforts and reducing current discrepancy of global, regional, and country-specific SOC estimates.

TI  - Phytochemical Composition and Potential Use of <i>Rubus</i> Species
T2  - GESUNDE PFLANZEN
AB  - Plants produce a number of compounds that are vital to the growth and development processes (primary metabolites) of cells and plant health. In addition to this type of metabolism, plants perform various processes that lead to taxonomically specific formation of compounds (secondary metabolites) that are a vital part of the human diet. Historically, plants have been used for their multiple benefits for the prevention and treatment of diseases. Rubus species are cultivated on all continents, at various altitudes, from temperate forests to tropical climates, and have edible and economically important fruits. The present review describes the polyphenols as the group of chemical substances that is most frequently found in species of the genus Rubus. Additionally, reference is made to nutritional components such as proteins, fats, calories, vitamins, fiber and minerals. Biochemical characteristics such as pH, total soluble solids and titratable acidity, and phytochemical compounds such as fatty acids, anthocyanins, total phenols, ellagitannis and saponins, among others, are presented. The uses of these compounds found in fruits, leaves, stems and seeds of Rubus species plants are considered, in regard to prevention and management of diseases and agroindustrial and pharmaceutical potential.

TI  - Genetic Differentiation and Spatial Structure of <i>Phellinus noxius</i>, the Causal Agent of Brown Root Rot of Woody Plants in Japan
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Phellinus noxius is a pathogenic fungus that causes brown root rot disease in a variety of tree species. This fungus is distributed in tropical and sub-tropical regions of Southeast and East Asia, Oceania, Australia, Central America and Africa. In Japan, it was first discovered on Ishigaki Island in Okinawa Prefecture in 1988; since then, it has been found on several of the Ryukyu Islands. Recently, this fungus was identified from the Ogasawara (Bonin) Islands, where it has killed trees, including rare endemic tree species. For effective control or quarantine methods, it is important to clarify whether the Japanese populations of P. noxius are indigenous to the area or if they have been introduced from other areas. We developed 20 microsatellite markers from genome assembly of P. noxius and genotyped 128 isolates from 12 of the Ryukyu Islands and 3 of the Ogasawara Islands. All isolates had unique genotypes, indicating that basidiospore infection is a primary dissemination method for the formation of new disease foci. Genetic structure analyses strongly supported genetic differentiation between the Ryukyu populations and the Ogasawara populations of P. noxius. High polymorphism of microsatellite loci suggests that Japanese populations are indigenous or were introduced a very long time ago. We discuss differences in invasion patterns between the Ryukyu Islands and the Ogasawara Islands.

TI  - INSECT-INDUCED WIND POLLINATION OF THE PALM CHAMAEDOREA-PINNATIFRONS AND POLLINATION IN THE RELATED WENDLANDIELLA SP
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - In Peruvian Amazonia pollination ecology of two palms, Chamaedorea pinnatifrons (Jacq.) Oerst. and Wendlandiella sp. was studied from October 1988 to January 1990. Both palms are dioecious understory species that form locally dense populations.
   In C. pinnatifrons both sexes flower synchronously during the dry season. Prior to anthesis, the pendulous male inflorescence is inhabited by numerous thrips (Thysanoptera) and Ptiliidae (Coleoptera). Staminate flowers open by a small basal slit between the petals. At anthesis pollen is shed and the movements of the insects inside the flowers trigger pollen release in small clouds. Thus, the powdery pollen becomes airborne and finally air currents act as a vector, carrying pollen to the inconspicuous female plants, which usually are not visited by insects. The term 'insect induced wind pollination' is suggested for this pollination mode.
   Wendlandiella flowers during four months in the dry season. Male and female plants were not visited by insects. The dry condition of the pollen indicates that anemophily is the pollination mode in Wendlandiella. Fructification is rare but the plants show intense vegetative propagation.
   The significance of anemophily in the tropical lowland rain forest is discussed.

TI  - Fusion of Visual and Audio Signals for Wildlife Surveillance
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY
AB  - Wildlife-vehicle collision (WVC) has been a significant threat to endangered species in Malaysia. Due to excessive development, tropical rainforests and their inhabitants have been edged towards extinction. Road buildings and other linear infrastructures, for instance, have caused forest destruction and forced wild animals to come out from their natural habitats to compete for resources with the human-beings. In Malaysia, much precious wildlife have been lost due to road accidents. Road signs and warning lights have been set up near wildlife crossing, but these do not help much. In this paper, we aim to propose a wildlife surveillance mechanism to detect the existence of wildlife near roadways using visual and audio input Machine learning classifiers, including Convolution Neural Network (CNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), and Naive Bayes, are adopted in the study. We focus on five types of the most frequently occurring wildlife on the roads: elephants, tapirs, Malayan bears, tigers, and wild boars. Experimental results demonstrate that a good accuracy as high as 99% can be achieved using the proposed approach. On the other hand, the Naive Bayes classifier ranks the lowest in performance with an accuracy value only up to 86%.

TI  - Mapping Mangrove Above-Ground Carbon Using Multi-Source Remote Sensing Data and Machine Learning Approach in Loh Buaya, Komodo National Park, Indonesia
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Mangrove forests provide numerous valuable ecosystem services and can sequester a large volume of carbon that can help mitigate climate change impacts. Modeling mangrove carbon with robust and valid approaches is crucial to better understanding existing conditions. The study aims to estimate mangrove Above-Ground Carbon (AGC) at Loh Buaya located in the Komodo National Park (Indonesia) using novel Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) analyses integrating multiple sources of remote sensing (optical, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), and Digital Elevation Model (DEM)) data. Several steps were conducted to assess the model's accuracy, starting with a field survey of 50 sampling plots, processing the images, selecting the variables, and examining the appropriate machine learning (ML) models. The effectiveness of the proposed XGB-GA was assessed via comparison with other well-known ML techniques, i.e., the Random Forest (RF) and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) models. Our results show that the hybrid XGB-GA model yielded the best results (R-2 = 0.857 in the training and R-2 = 0.758 in the testing phase). The proposed hybrid model optimized by the GA consisted of six spectral bands and five vegetation indices generated from Sentinel 2B together with a national DEM that had an RMSE = 15.40 Mg C ha(-1) and outperformed other ML models for quantifying mangrove AGC. The XGB-GA model estimated mangrove AGC ranging from 2.52 to 123.89 Mg C ha(-1) (with an average of 57.16 Mg C ha(-1)). Our findings contribute an innovative method, which is fast and reliable using open-source data and software. Multisource remotely sensed data combined with advanced machine learning techniques can potentially be used to estimate AGC in tropical mangrove ecosystems worldwide.

TI  - Unraveling the genomic complexity of sylvatic mosquitoes in changing Neotropical environments
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB  - Sylvatic New World mosquitoes (e.g. Old-growth Forest species) can transmit viruses among non-human primates. This could be a continuous source of viral cycling and spillover events from animals to humans, particularly in changing environments. However, most species of Neotropical sylvatic mosquitoes (genera Aedes, Haemagogus, and Sabethes), which include vector and non-vector species, currently lack genomic resources because there is no reliable and accurate approach for creating de novo reference genomes for these insects. This is a major knowledge gap in the biology of these mosquitoes, restricting our ability to predict and mitigate the emergence and spread of novel arboviruses in Neotropical regions. We discuss recent advances and potential solutions for generating hybrid de novo assemblies from vector and non-vector species using pools of consanguineous offspring. We also discussed research opportunities likely to emerge from these genomic resources.

TI  - Cloud-native Seascape Mapping of Mozambique's Quirimbas National Park with Sentinel-2
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - The lack of detailed spatial information on coastal resources, notably shallow water coral reefs and associated benthic habitats, impedes our ability to protect and manage them in the face of global climate change and anthropogenic impacts. Here, we develop a semi-automated workflow in the cloud that uses freely available Sentinel-2 data from the European Space Agency (ESA) Copernicus programme to derive information on near-shore coral reef habitats in the Quirimbas National Park (QNP), a recently declared biosphere reserve in northern Mozambique. We use an end-to-end cloud-based framework within the Google Earth Engine cloud geospatial platform to process imagery from raw pixels to cloud-free composites which are corrected for glint and surface artefacts, water column and derived estimated depth and then classified into four benthic habitats. Using independent training and validation data, we apply three supervised classification algorithms: random forests (RF), support vector machine (SVM) and classification and regression trees (CART). Our results show that random forests are the most accurate supervised algorithm with over 82% overall accuracy. We mapped over 105 000 ha of shallow water habitat inside the protected area, of which 18% are dominated by coral and hardbottom; 27.5% are seagrass and submerged aquatic vegetation and another 23.4% are soft and sandy substrates, and the remaining area is optically deep water. We employ satellite-derived bathymetry to assess slope, bathymetric position, rugosity and underwater topography of these habitats. Finally, a spectral unmixing model provides further sub-pixel-level information of habitats with the potential to monitor changes over time. This effort provides the first, consistent and repeatable and also scalable coastal information system for an east African tropical marine protected area, which hosts shallow-water ecosystems which are of great significance to local communities and building resilience towards climate change.

TI  - MICROHABITATS OF AEDES ALBOPICTUS (SKUSE) IN THE PARAIBA VALLEY REGION OF THE STATE OF SAO-PAULO, BRAZIL
T2  - REVISTA DE SAUDE PUBLICA
AB  - The objective of this study was the determination of extent of the spacial distribution of Aedes albopictus in the Paraiba River Valley, State S. Paulo, Brazil. Thus, collections of larvae and pupae mosquitoes were carried out at six sites distributed along a transection with a 10-km extension. The target was the treeholes but artificial containers were also used in this investigation. Aedes terrens and Ae. albopictus were the only species of genus Aedes present in the treeholes mentioned. The segregation of seven species of the treehole community was undertaken in the light of macrohabitat and microhabitat features. Thus, the distribution of Ae. albopictus was found to cover the rural, rural-urban and urban zones, but the rural-urban held the preference. Ae. albopictus never present in the residual and primary forest. The favorable, factor to infestation with Ae. albopictus in the Paraiba Valley seems to have been the large number of natural niches made vacant by human influence. The rain has been important in the production of larvae and pupae, but the rainfall period does not coincide with the maximum production on them. The treeholes whose volume exceeded 600 ml were the most productive breeding places. The abundance of these two stages occurs in the summer and autumn. However, the highest peak was observed in the months of March and April. These seasonal variations were found to be common in both the bamboo trap and the artificial container. The temperature data suggest a limit of from 17 to 23-degrees-C for the best development of larvae. In the light of this, the strain of Ae. albopictus studied seems to have originated in tropical Asia. Just as happened with Ae. aegypti it may become an important epidemiological vector for the dengue fever and provide links for yellow fever transmission in Brazil.

TI  - Fatal Rattlesnake Envenomation in Northernmost Brazilian Amazon: A Case Report and Literature Overview
T2  - REPORTS
AB  - Snakebite envenomations are classified as Category A Neglected Tropical Diseases by the World Health Organization. In Brazil, 405 snake species are distributed among 11 families, with the genera Bothrops and Crotalus being the most studied and main responsible for severe and lethal envenomations. In the country, Crotalus genus (i.e., rattlesnakes) is represented by Crotalus durissus species, showing seven different subspecies distributed along the country, including Crotalus durissus ruruima, which inhabits Roraima, the Brazilian nothermost state from Amazon forest. Here, we report a fatal case of a severe envenomation following a rattlesnake bite. The patient presented classic crotalic neurological signs and symptoms such as ptosis, drooling of saliva, sluggishness, macroscopic hematuria, and oliguria, which evolved to acute kidney failure (AKF) and hemodynamic instability. Although the patient was treated with the specific antivenom therapy, the severe envenomation resulted in three cardiac arrests and death of the victim in less than 38 h. This study discusses the causes of the patient death, the features of rattlesnake venom-induced AKF, and shows evidences that the Brazilian crotalic antivenom should be improved to treat rattlesnake envenomations caused by C. d. ruruima venom in Roraima state.

TI  - Malaria Risk Map Using Spatial Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis along Yunnan Border During the Pre-elimination Period
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - In moving toward malaria elimination, finer scale malaria risk maps are required to identify hotspots for implementing surveillance-response activities, allocating resources, and preparing health facilities based on the needs and necessities at each specific area. This study aimed to demonstrate the use of multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) in conjunction with geographic information systems (GISs) to create a spatial model and risk maps by integrating satellite remote-sensing and malaria surveillance data from 18 counties of Yunnan Province along the China-Myanmar border. The MCDA composite and annual models and risk maps were created from the consensus among the experts who have been working and know situations in the study areas. The experts identified and provided relative factor weights for nine socioeconomic and disease ecology factors as a weighted linear combination model of the following: ([Forest coverage x 0.041] + [Cropland x 0.086] + [Water body x 0.175] + [Elevation x 0.297] + [Human population density x 0.043] + [Imported case x 0.258] + [Distance to road x 0.030] + [Distance to health facility x 0.033] + [Urbanization x 0.036]). The expert-based model had a good prediction capacity with a high area under curve. The study has demonstrated the novel integrated use of spatial MCDA which combines multiple environmental factors in estimating disease risk by using decision rules derived from existing knowledge or hypothesized understanding of the risk factors via diverse quantitative and qualitative criteria using both data-driven and qualitative indicators from the experts. The model and fine MCDA risk map developed in this study could assist in focusing the elimination efforts in the specifically identified locations with high risks.

TI  - Choice Modeling for the Commercial Cultivation of Underutilized Aromatic Plants for Producing Mosquito Repellents: Targeting Rural Sector Income Generation
T2  - ECONOMIC BOTANY
AB  - Tropical countries face considerable economic losses due to mosquito-borne diseases which can be effectively combatted using plant-based mosquito repellents. Therefore, using a questionnaire survey, we selected the 25 top-ranked common but underutilized aromatic plants with mosquito repellent ability in Sri Lanka to investigate the rural sector's willingness to cultivate and supply them. Cinnamomum verum, Citrus aurantiifolia, Citrus sinensis, Citrus reticulata, Aegle marmelos, and Ocimum tenuiflorum were the common species thus identified. The willingness to cultivate and supply aromatic plants with mosquito repellent ability varied between 88% and 60%. The Chi-squared test indicated a significant association between gender and willingness to cultivate and supply these plants. Men had a higher willingness (82%). Persons formally educated up to elementary school level had the highest willingness (85%). The willingness from households with many non-income-generating members was 100%. The random forest model developed in this study identifies farmers' willingness to cultivate and supply aromatic plants with mosquito repellent properties. It was trained using an upsampling strategy. Our findings aid in understanding the scenarios involved with introducing, cultivating, and supplying aromatic plants.

TI  - Childhood tuberculosis treatment outcome and its association with HIV co-infection in Ethiopia: a systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HEALTH
AB  - Background Tuberculosis is the second leading cause of death from an infectious disease worldwide, next to HIV. Hence, initiating and determining the national tuberculosis treatment program and outcome is crucial. However, the childhood tuberculosis treatment outcome in Ethiopia was not investigated. Objective This study determined the pooled estimate of childhood tuberculosis treatment outcome and its association with HIV co-infection. Methods PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, reference lists of included studies, and Ethiopian institutional research repositories were used to retrieve all available studies. Searching was limited to the studies that had been conducted in Ethiopia and published in the English language. In this study, observational studies, including cohort, cross-sectional, and case-control studies, were included. The estimate of childhood tuberculosis treatment outcome was determined using a weighted inverse variance random-effects model. The overall variation between studies was checked by the heterogeneity test (I-2). The Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) quality appraisal criteria were used for quality assessment of the studies. The summary estimates were presented with forest plots and tables. Publication bias was also checked with the funnel plot and Egger's regression test. The outcome measures were successful and unsuccessful treatment outcomes. Successful treatment outcomes are defined as patients who are cured and treatment completed, whereas, an unsuccessful treatment outcome means those patients with defaulter, failure, and death treatment outcomes. Result To estimate the overall pooled estimate of successful treatment outcome, 6 studies with 5389 participants were considered. Consequently, the overall pooled estimate of successful treatment outcome was 79.62% (95% CI 73.22, 86.02) of which 72.44% was treatment completed. On the other hand, unsuccessful treatment outcomes, including treatment failure, defaulter, and death, were 0.15%, 5.36%, and 3.54%, respectively. Moreover, this study found that HIV co-infection was significantly associated with childhood tuberculosis treatment outcomes. Poor treatment outcome was higher among children with HIV co-infection with an odds ratio of 3.15 (95% CI 1.67, 5.94) compared to that of HIV-negative children. Conclusion The summary estimate of successful childhood tuberculosis treatment outcome was low compared to the threshold suggested by the World Health Organization. HIV co-infection is significantly associated with poor treatment outcome of childhood tuberculosis. Therefore, special attention is better to be given to children infected with HIV. Moreover, adherence to anti-TB has to be strengthened.

TI  - Comparison of the dynamics of Japanese encephalitis virus circulation in sentinel pigs between a rural and a peri-urban setting in Cambodia
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Japanese encephalitis is mainly considered a rural disease, but there is growing evidence of a peri-urban and urban transmission in several countries, including Cambodia. We, therefore, compared the epidemiologic dynamic of Japanese encephalitis between a rural and a peri-urban setting in Cambodia. We monitored two cohorts of 15 pigs and determined the force of infection-rate at which seronegative pigs become positive-in two study farms located in a peri-urban and rural area, respectively. We also studied the mosquito abundance and diversity in proximity of the pigs, as well as the host densities in both areas. All the pigs seroconverted before the age of 6 months. The force of infection was 0.061 per day (95% confidence interval = 0.034-0.098) in the peri-urban cohort and 0.069 per day (95% confidence interval = 0.047-0.099) in the rural cohort. Several differences in the epidemiologic dynamic of Japanese encephalitis between both study sites were highlighted. The later virus amplification in the rural cohort may be linked to the later waning of maternal antibodies, but also to the higher pig density in direct proximity of the studied pigs, which could have led to a dilution of mosquito bites at the farm level. The force of infection was almost identical in both the peri-urban and the rural farms studied, which shifts the classic epidemiologic cycle of the virus. This study is a first step in improving our understanding of Japanese encephalitis virus ecology in different environments with distinct landscapes, human and animal densities.

TI  - Genetic approaches in Aedes aegypti for control of denguean overview
T2  - BRIDGING LABORATORY AND FIELD RESEARCH FOR GENETIC CONTROL OF DISEASE VECTORS
CP  - Conference on Bridging Laboratory and Field Research for Genetic Control of Disease Vectors
AB  - The mosquito-borne dengue viruses (DV) cause an estimated 50 million human infections annually. The incidence of severe dengue disease in Southeast Asia and Latin America is increasing at an alarming rate. There are currently no vaccines or anti-viral therapies available to mitigate dengue disease. Current methodologies for controlling the principal vector, Aedes aegypti, are inadequate and ineffective. A potential solution to this growing human-health crisis is to develop new genetics-based vector control (GVC) approaches as part of an integrated control strategy. GVC includes both population reduction and population replacement strategies and represents a broad spectrum of genetic mechanisms at various stages in their development for field-testing. To realize the full potentials of these GVC strategies it is critical that we investigate, evaluate and, where appropriate, develop these strategies to the point where they can be deployed at field sites in one or more disease-endemic countries (DECs).

TI  - Global burden and trends of firearm violence in 204 countries/territories from 1990 to 2019
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - BackgroundGaps remained in the updated information of the firearm violence (FV) burden from a global landscape. Understanding the global burden of FV could contribute to decision-making. MethodsData on the FV burden, including physical violence by firearm (PVF), self-harm by firearm (SHF), and unintentional firearm injuries (UFI), were extracted from the Global Burden of Disease 2019. The temporal trends of age-standardized rate (ASR) were estimated using estimated annual percentage change (EAPC). ResultsIn 2019, PVF, SHF, and UFI reported 710.64 x 10(3), 335.25 x 10(3), and 2,133.88 x 10(3), respectively, incident cases worldwide. Their ASR (/100,000 people-years) were 9.31, 4.05, and 28.07. During 1990-2019, the overall incident ASRs of PVF presented an increasing trend (EAPC = 0.61, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.48 to 0.75). Notably, pronounced increasing trends were observed in Tropical Latin America, and North Africa and Middle East. However, incident trends of SHF and UFI declined globally, with the respective EAPCs being -0.68 (95% CI: -0.83 to -0.54) and -0.98 (95% CI: -1.19 to -0.77). In 2019, the ASR of death due to PVF, SHF, and UFI were 2.23, 0.65, and 0.26, and that of DALYs were 127.56, 28.10, and 17.64, respectively. Decreasing trends in the ASRs of FV were observed in most regions and countries worldwide over the past three decades, particularly that of PVF in Estonia. ConclusionThe FV burden was heterogeneous across regions and countries, which was deeply subjected to socioeconomic factors. The findings highlighted that specific prevention strategies and interventions were required, particularly in the high prevalent settings.

TI  - Low prevalence of HTLV-II in Mayan Indians in the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico
T2  - ARCHIVES OF MEDICAL RESEARCH
AB  - Infection with HTLV-II is endemic in Amerindians, with prevalence ranging from 0.89% - 33%. To determine the prevalence of HTLV-II among indigenous Mayans in the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico, 440 indigenous Mayans were recruited, all native to and residents of one of six Mayan communities in the Yucatan Peninsula, (Xohuayan n=144, Yaxachen n=101, Kanxoc n=84, Xocen n=40 Nabalan n=46 and X'calot n=25) between May, 1992 and June, 1993. All of the above are pre-Hispanic settlements located in tropical forest with no immigrations for over 50 years. Of the 440 indigenous Mayans, only one woman from the X'calot tribe (0.23%) was shown to be infected with HTLV-II. A high percentage of indeterminate results was found (22/439, 5%), three of which were accounted for by the husband and two children of the positive female case. PCR analysis followed by specific restriction digestion demonstrated the virus to be of the HTLV-IIb subtype, similar to that described in the Guaymi Indians from Panama. The presence of HTLV-TI in the Mayan ethnos, and in other Amerindian populations supports the idea that HTLV-IP is an ancestral virus in America and that it has been sustained in "closed" communities.

TI  - Environmental and socioeconomic determinants of leptospirosis incidence in Colombia
T2  - CADERNOS DE SAUDE PUBLICA
AB  - Human leptospirosis is an infection that most often affects tropical countries. Since 2007, Colombia requires the notification of disease cases, enabling the observation of an increase in cases in recent years. The objectives of this article were to analyze environmental and socioeconomic variables and to evaluate their relationship with human leptospirosis cases. This is an ecological study on human leptospirosis cases aggregated by municipality and reported between 2007 and 2016. Spatial aggregation assessment was made using the Getis-Ord Gi method, and negative binomial regression was used to evaluate the relationship between environmental and socioeconomic variables with human leptospirosis. During the study period, 9,928 cases of human leptospirosis were reported, and 58.9% of municipalities reported at least one case. Four hotspots of human leptospirosis, including 18 municipalities, were identified. The results of the negative binomial model confirmed the importance of the effects of education, poverty and some climatic variables on the decadal incidence rate of human leptospirosis. Our results confirm the importance of socioeconomic determinants such as social marginality associated with violence and education, as well as ecological variables such as rainfall, height above sea level and forest coverage on the incidence rate of human leptospirosis at municipal scale.

TI  - Effects of Bixa orellana L. Seeds on Hyperlipidemia
T2  - PHYTOTHERAPY RESEARCH
AB  - Bixa orellana L., urucum, or urucu, a native tropical tree of Central and South American rain forests is used to treat various diseases in popular medicine. In Ceara, Northeast of Brazil, the seeds of urucum have been used for the treatment of high lipid blood levels. The present study investigated the effects of the aqueous extract from Bixa orellana seeds (AEBO) in mice with hyperlipidemia induced by tyloxapol, fructose and ethanol. In hyperlipidemia induced by Triton WR1339, 400 and 800 mg/kg AEBO reduced triglycerides (TG) serum levels at 24h and 48h. In the study of hypertriglyceridemia induced by fructose, AEBO in doses of 400mg/kg and 800 mg/kg reduced TG levels by 48.2% and 48.7%, respectively. Finally, the ethanol experimental model with 400 mg/kg AEBO promoted a reduction of 33.6% of TG levels, while the 800 mg/kg concentration reduced hypertriglyceridemia in 62.2%. In conclusion, the aqueous extract of the seeds of Bixa orellana was capable of reversing the hypertriglyceridemia induced by Triton, fructose and ethanol, demonstrating a hypolipidemic effect. However, further studies are necessary to discover the precise mechanism of action. Copyright (C) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Common pattern of distribution for Mesoamerican <i>Triatoma dimidiata</i> suggest geological and ecological association
T2  - ACTA TROPICA
AB  - The phylogeny of the Triatoma dimidiata complex has been widely assessed with different genetic and morphological data, which has allowed to reach the consensus that the complex consists of at least three taxonomic units. However, these taxonomic units seem to have a distribution related to geography throughout Mesoamerica, with different groupings depending on the source of information used. In the present study, we aimed to determine if there is a common biogeographical, genetic and phenetic distribution pattern among the T. dimidiata species in Mesoamerica and if this pattern is related to ecological and geological variability of the region. We found that panbiogeographical analysis showed three generalized tracks that coincide with genetic/phenetic data which showed a general pattern of distribution in two big clusters to the north and south of Mesoamerica. We also found that these clusters were significantly related to geological tectonic plates and ecotypes. We conclude that the geological history may be a plausible explanation for the greater differentiation observed in the T. dimidiata complex, but that the current ecological characteristics of the morphotectonic units or ecotypes may be responsible for the additional variation observed and therefore differential control strategies for each cluster considering geological history and ecotype should be used. Further, more detailed biogeographical and landscape genetic analyses are necessary with the goal to elucidate T. dimidiata differentiation related with ecological and geological variables in the region and the possible epidemiological and evolutionary consequences.

TI  - Coupling a generic disease model to the WARM rice simulator to assess leaf and panicle blast impacts in a temperate climate
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY
AB  - Blast disease (Magnaporthe oryzae B. Couch) is one of the most important causes of rice yield losses worldwide. Although farmers implement countermeasures to limit its impacts, blast disease is still an important constraint to rice production in both tropical and temperate environments. This study presents the coupling of a generic disease model to the WARM rice simulator to quantify the pathogen impact on key physiological processes and thus on final yield. The impact of leaf blast was simulated by reducing the photosynthetic leaf area index and in turn radiation interception, as a function of disease progress rate. Panicle blast damage was reproduced by decreasing the percentage of photosynthates translocated to kernels. The modelling solution was calibrated and evaluated using field observations of blast impact at harvest, collected on 20 rice cultivars with different blast resistance and grown in five sites in Northern Italy in the period 1996-2012 (total 272 observations). Results showed a good correlation between simulated impacts (fraction of potential yield) and observations (0-5 scale used for the visual assessment, with 0 = no impact and 5 = complete crop failure), for both calibration (R-2 = 0.57) and evaluation (R-2 = 0.51) datasets. Model outputs were converted to the same scale used for the visual assessments to perform an in-depth evaluation of the modelling solution, which exactly matched the 46% of observed impact values, and presented an error of 1 class in 48.2% of the cases. This study demonstrated the soundness of the approach developed for crop-pathogen interactions and its suitability for the application in research-e.g., to explore the impacts of climate change on blast-related yield losses -and operational contexts-e.g., to test alternate fungicide strategies to optimize agricultural chemical applications.

TI  - The utilization of trees by endangered primate species Javan slow loris (<i>Nycticebus javanicus</i>) in shade-grown coffee agroforestry of Central Java
T2  - 3RD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE IN AGROFORESTRY (ICAF): ADOPTING MODERN AGROFORESTRY TOWARD SMART SOCIAL FORESTRY PROGRAM
CP  - 3rd International Conference in Agroforestry (ICAF SEANAFE) - Adopting Modern Agroforestry Toward Smart Social Forestry Program
AB  - Although human intervention remains high,a shade-grown coffee agroforestry in Kemuning, Central Java still have important roles for biodiversity conservation. Among various fauna, the Javan slow loris (Nycticebus javanicus), a critically endangered species, can survive in this agroforestry system. The use of spatial method on shade-grown coffee agroforestry seems unusual. We aim to investigate the utilization of tree and other vegetation by Javan slow lorises in a shade-grown coffee agroforestry ecosystem in Kemuning Forest. We followed two individuals (male and female) of slow lorises from December 2018 until May 2019 using radio collar. We recorded both vertical and horizontal positions of each individual based on their position on trees at two spatial dimensions (vertical and horizontal). To explore whether lorises select certain tree species, we laid 275 plots (20x20m) in their habitat and using Chi-square test for the analysis. Our findings show that both male and female of Javan slow loris in shade-grown coffee agroforestry use different forest stratum for their activity. The female used 42.11% of their time to do exploratory activity in the outer part of the canopy, regardless the vertical position, and 43.76% in the middle part (vertical position) and the outer part (horizontal position) of the canopy. While the male mostly uses the inner part of the canopy (52.57%) and upper part of the canopy for feeding activity (64.37%). Both male (Chi-square test = 264.05, p < 0.05) and female (Chi-square test = 357.35, p < 0.05) lorises select tree species for their behavior. We provide here evidence of biodiversity conservation services by shade-grown coffee agroforestry practices in Indonesia. The intensity of coffee management under tropical trees seems does not impact significantly to the presence and behavior of slow loris, however precautionary measures to reduce poaching should be done as this endangered species threatened by illegal activity. Benefivial values from managing shade-grown coffee agroforestry for generating income for locals such as wildlife-friendly coffee production can also be alternative hand in hand to reduce poaching.

TI  - Pathogen regulation of plant diversity via effective specialization
T2  - TRENDS IN ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION
AB  - The Janzen-Connell (JC) hypothesis, one of the most influential hypotheses explaining forest diversity, is inconsistent with evidence that tree species share the same natural enemies. Through the discussion of seedling diseases from a pathogen-centered perspective, we expand the JC hypothesis to tie in host-pathogen-environment interactions at three levels: local adaptation, host specificity of the combined effect of multiple infections, and environmental modulation of disease. We present evidence from plant pathology, disease ecology, and host-parasite evolution relevant to (but not commonly associated with) forest species diversity maintenance. This expanded view of the JC hypothesis suggests ways to direct new experiments to integrate research on pathogen local adaptation, co-infection, and environmental effects on infection by using high-throughput molecular techniques and statistical models.

TI  - Identification of diseases and physiological disorders in potato via multispectral drone imagery using machine learning tools
T2  - TROPICAL PLANT PATHOLOGY
AB  - The rapid and precise detection of diseases and plant disorders is the basis for the adequate and timely design of management strategies. Currently, there are several non-destructive alternatives that allow early detection, highlighting the use of spectral cameras attached to unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The objective of this research was to evaluate the use of multispectral cameras on UAVs to discriminate vascular wilt caused by Verticillium spp., (VW), waterlogging stress (WL), and an unknown alteration (UA) in commercial potato (Solanum tuberosum) variety "Diacol Capiro" crops. Plots were monitored during the crop cycle, performing the visual characterization of the diseases and disorders present. Five spectral band images were acquired using a MicaSense RedEdge spectral camera attached to a Map-T680 hexacopter drone to extract the bands and calculate the vegetation indices that were calibrated and evaluated to determine their ability to discriminate between diseased and healthy plants based on a generalized linear model (GLM) and Kappa index. Additionally, the supervised random forest classification method was implemented, optimized, and evaluated using the accuracy, area under receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC), kappa index, and inference error based on k-fold cross-validation. After algorithms optimization our results show a classifier accuracy, kappa and ROC-AUC values to VW, WL and UA between 73.5-82.5%, 0.56-0.71, 0.97-0.98, and 35 37.5-51.9%, 0.07-0.06, and 0.88-0.94 for plots 1 and 2, respectively. This study reports an approach to the use of multispectral cameras attached to UAVs as a tool with potential for the detection of diseases and physiological disorders in commercial potato crops.

TI  - Cytogenetic Study in a Mutant of <i>Triatoma infestans</i> (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) Carrying a Spontaneous Autosomal Fusion and an Extra Chromosome
T2  - CYTOGENETIC AND GENOME RESEARCH
AB  - Triatoma infestans (2n = 20 A + XY, male) is a blood-sucking bug and the most important vector of Chagas disease in the Southern Cone countries. A cytogenetic analysis of 14 individuals from the Argentine Gran Chaco has revealed the presence of a naturally heterozygous for an autosomal fusion. The fusion heterozygote (2n = 19 A + 1 extra chromosome + XY, male) presented an autosomal trivalent, 8 bivalents, the X and Y sex univalents, and a minute extra chromosome at meiosis I. The autosomal trivalent divided equationally at first anaphase. At metaphase II, cells had 8 autosomes, X and Y sex chromosomes, and an autosomal pseudo-trivalent composed by 3 different-sized chromatids. The orientation of this pseudo-trivalent led to a reductional segregation. The meiotic behaviour of this new chromosome complement was highly regular. The extra chromosome did not affect the segregation of autosomes and sex chromosomes during both meiotic divisions. We propose that the extra chromosome was originated as a product of an autosomal fusion, and it might become a B chromosome. Many authors suggest that karyotype evolution in Heteroptera has proceeded mainly by fusions and fragmentations. The fact that this rearrangement has been found in a natural population of T. infestans and that it shows a regular meiotic behaviour seems to support the suggested hypothesis. Copyright (C) 2012 S.

TI  - Integrated Landsat Image Analysis and Hydrologic Modeling to Detect Impacts of 25-Year Land-Cover Change on Surface Runoff in a Philippine Watershed
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Landsat MSS and ETM+ images were analyzed to detect 25-year land-cover change (1976-2001) in the critical Taguibo Watershed in Mindanao Island, Southern Philippines. This watershed has experienced historical modifications of its land-cover due to the presence of logging industries in the 1950s, and continuous deforestation due to illegal logging and slash-and-burn agriculture in the present time. To estimate the impacts of land-cover change on watershed runoff, land-cover information derived from the Landsat images was utilized to parameterize a GIS-based hydrologic model. The model was then calibrated with field-measured discharge data and used to simulate the responses of the watershed in its year 2001 and year 1976 land-cover conditions. The availability of land-cover information on the most recent state of the watershed from the Landsat ETM+ image made it possible to locate areas for rehabilitation such as barren and logged-over areas. We then created a "rehabilitated" land-cover condition map of the watershed (re-forestation of logged-over areas and agro-forestation of barren areas) and used it to parameterize the model and predict the runoff responses of the watershed. Model results showed that changes in land-cover from 1976 to 2001 were directly related to the significant increase in surface runoff. Runoff predictions showed that a full rehabilitation of the watershed, especially in barren and logged-over areas, will be likely to reduce the generation of a huge volume of runoff during rainfall events. The results of this study have demonstrated the usefulness of multi-temporal Landsat images in detecting land-cover change, in identifying areas for rehabilitation, and in evaluating rehabilitation strategies for management of tropical watersheds through its use in hydrologic modeling.

TI  - TREATMENT OF INTRACRANIAL ALPHAVIRUS INFECTIONS IN MICE BY A COMBINATION OF SPECIFIC ANTIBODIES AND AN INTERFERON INDUCER
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Finding an effective treatment for viral infections that cause encephalitis remains an important problem. A model of human alphavirus infections, Semliki Forest virus, causes lethal encephalitis in weanling mice. Mice are viremic within 24 hr of an intraperitoneal challenge with the equivalent of three 75% lethal doses of Semliki Forest virus. Virus reaches the brain by 48 hr, and mortality results in all mice in 5-7 days. Introduction of virus intracranially accelerates the course of the infection. Neither anti-Semliki Forest virus hyperimmune serum nor the potent interferon inducer poly I:CLC given intraperitoneally are protective when used therapeutically after an intracranial virus infection, but a combination of 1,000 U hyperimmune serum and 80 mu g/mouse of poly I:CLC results in a 50% survival rate. This combination treatment of intracranial Semliki Forest virus infection eliminates detectable viremia and reduces virus load in the brain over the course of the infection. These data show that when combined, specific antibody and an interferon inducer can interact synergistically to protect mice from alphavirus infections of the central nervous system even when given after the virus is replicating in the target organ.

TI  - Thigmomorphogenesis: changes in morphology, biochemistry, and levels of transcription in response to mechanical stress in <i>Acacia koa</i>
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
AB  - Acacia koa A. Gray, an economically important timber-wood tree growing in the Hawaiian Islands, is affected by many environmental stresses, including drought, strong wind, heavy rain, and infection by fungal pathogens. Previous studies have shown that some morphological and biochemical changes that take place as a result of environmental stresses in plants can be also induced by mechanical stresses such as touching and bending. We studied morphological and biochemical changes and levels of gene transcription in A. koa plants due to mechanical stress. For a mechanical stress treatment, A. koa seedlings were gently bent in four cardinal directions daily for 2-6 months, after which morphological and biochemical changes were quantified. The stressed A. koa had significantly increased stem diameter, number of xylem cells, and anthocyanin and lignin contents and significantly reduced stem length. The gene expression analyses showed that 53 genes, including the genes for calcium signaling, ethylene biosynthesis, abscisic acid degradation, stress-related transcriptional regulation, and disease resistance, were induced more than twofold within 10-60 min following mechanical stress. The observation that the genes for disease resistance such as NBS-LRR can be induced by mechanical stress suggests that strong wind and rain in the natural forest may also induce disease resistance in trees.

TI  - VECTOR COMPETENCE OF SIMULIUM-EXIGUUM FOR ONCHOCERCA-VOLVULUS - IMPLICATIONS FOR THE EPIDEMIOLOGY OF ONCHOCERCIASIS
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - In the transmission of human onchocerciasis, competence of the black fly vector influences intensity of transmission by regulating how many infective-stage larvae are produced. The disease is intensifying in Ecuador where Simulium exiguum is a highly efficient limitation-type vector comparable with African forest species in terms of the percentage of flies developing infective-stage larvae and the numbers of larvae per infected fly. In contrast, the endemic foci in Guatemala and southern Mexico have remained stable and closely circumscribed around larval development sites for S. ochraceum, a vector that exhibits a facilitation type of competence and must feed on people with comparatively high microfiladeremia to develop significant numbers of infective-stage larvae. This comparison indicates that assessments of vector competence should be included when planning regional control programs for onchocerciasis.

TI  - Colletotrichum gloeosporioides: Apparent continuous spore rain may hide local disparities and iterative disease dynamics
T2  - TROPICAL AGRICULTURE
AB  - Crop diseases are often considered as episodic events associated with specific environmental and weather conditions, but little is known about disease development when conditions for epidemics are sustained in time, as often occurs in the tropics. Colletotrichum gloeosporioides (anthracnose) presence on guava trees was monitored for 45 weeks. Results showed that spore prevalence varied but was consistently present over the period and was greater during the dry than during the rainy season. Secondly, while the general pattern was that of continuous presence of the disease throughout the study area, local patterns on individual trees presented casual peaks that were only partially concomitant, thus suggesting that apparent continuous fungal propagule rain observed in the fields results from distinct repetitive local spore pulses, potentially with asymmetrical contribution from the surrounding vegetation. Local disease dynamics in wild vegetation adjacent to the fields should therefore be more closely investigated in order to clarify its role in crop disease at greater scales such as landscape levels.

TI  - The presence of Culicidae species in medium-sized cities in the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil and the risk of West Nile fever and other arbovirus infection
T2  - REVISTA DA SOCIEDADE BRASILEIRA DE MEDICINA TROPICAL
AB  - Introduction: The objectives for this study were to measure the diversity of Culicidae species, describe their abundance and seasonal variation in Sao Jose do Rio Preto, SP, and discuss the risk of arbovirus infections. Methods: The collection of larval and adult mosquitoes was conducted monthly from 2006 to 2007 in an urban area and four sections of forested land. In the urban area, larvae were collected from sites where oviposition by Culex mosquitoes was most likely to occur. At two of the four sites in the forested land, adult mosquitoes were collected with the use of CDC traps at night, and a Nasci aspirator was used in the daytime at the two other collection sites. Results: In the urban area, 34 Culicidae species were identified out of a total sample of 8,683 specimens; of these specimens, 80.7% were Culex quinquefasciatus, 9.6% were Culex coronator, 3.2% were Aedes albopictus, and 1.1% were Ochlerotatus fluviatilis. The abundance of Cx. quinquefasciatus larvae was negatively related to rainfal. In the woods, 2,268 mosquitoes were collected, representing 10 genera and 46 species. The most abundant mosquito species were Aedeomyia squamipennis, Culex coronator, Culex (Mel.) Melanoconion section, Culex declarator, Ochlerotatus scapularis, Anopheles triannulatus, Culex bidens/interfor and Culex habilitator/pseudojhantinosoma. Conclusions: The abundance of Cx. quinquefasciatus in the urban area and the presence of other Culicidae species in urban areas and forested land point to the possibility of the transmission of West Nile virus and other arbovirus infections in Sao Jose do Rio Preto and other cities. Thus, the enacting of measures aimed at the surveillance of these arbovirus infections is essential.

TI  - Parasite and pathogen effects on ecosystem processes: A quantitative review
T2  - ECOSPHERE
AB  - Pathogens and parasites (henceforth "pathogens") can make up a large percentage of the biomass found in ecosystems, and therefore, their impacts on ecosystem processes should be prominent. Pathogens influence ecosystem processes by affecting the abundance or phenotype of hosts and through direct contributions to ecosystem production. However, there has been little quantitative synthesis of the relative effect sizes of these impacts on ecosystem processes. This study presents a systematic review and meta-analysis of pathogen effects on primary production, secondary production, and biogeochemical cycles. We find that the effects of pathogens on ecosystem processes were greater where pathogens influenced host or community abundance or biomass than when they influenced phenotypes. Pathogen impacts on primary production were larger than on secondary production or biogeochemical cycles. By contrast, we detected no general differences in effect sizes across host or pathogen taxon or ecosystem type (terrestrial vs. aquatic). While we have found potential evidence of publication bias against negative results, a well-known issue in meta-analyses, our work nonetheless shows that the available literature under-represents some taxa and geographic regions. To better understand the extent and magnitude of pathogen impacts on ecosystem processes, future research is needed in four areas. First, research is needed on the most understudied systems, including bacteria and viruses, as well as tropical ecosystems. A second priority is research seeking to understand how key components of ecosystem variation, including age (time of ecological continuity), productivity, and species diversity and composition, may interact to mediate pathogen impacts. Third, we suggest expanding on work examining how pathogen effects are influenced by climate change, species introductions, deforestation, and other human impacts. Fourth, we expect that host coinfection influences ecosystem processes in ways that cannot always be predicted based on studies of single infections. To enable others to build on this work, we make available the data we extracted from the literature, with the code for computing effect sizes.

TI  - A Multilayer Network Approach for Guiding Drug Repositioning in Neglected Diseases
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Drug development for neglected diseases has been historically hampered due to lack of market incentives. The advent of public domain resources containing chemical information from high throughput screenings is changing the landscape of drug discovery for these diseases. In this work we took advantage of data from extensively studied organisms like human, mouse, E. coli and yeast, among others, to develop a novel integrative network model to prioritize and identify candidate drug targets in neglected pathogen proteomes, and bioactive drug-like molecules. We modeled genomic (proteins) and chemical (bioactive compounds) data as a multilayer weighted network graph that takes advantage of bioactivity data across 221 species, chemical similarities between 1.7 10(5) compounds and several functional relations among 1.67 10(5) proteins. These relations comprised orthology, sharing of protein domains, and shared participation in defined biochemical pathways. We showcase the application of this network graph to the problem of prioritization of new candidate targets, based on the information available in the graph for known compound-target associations. We validated this strategy by performing a cross validation procedure for known mouse and Trypanosoma cruzi targets and showed that our approach outperforms classic alignment-based approaches. Moreover, our model provides additional flexibility as two different network definitions could be considered, finding in both cases qualitatively different but sensible candidate targets. We also showcase the application of the network to suggest targets for orphan compounds that are active against Plasmodium falciparum in high-throughput screens. In this case our approach provided a reduced prioritization list of target proteins for the query molecules and showed the ability to propose new testable hypotheses for each compound. Moreover, we found that some predictions highlighted by our network model were supported by independent experimental validations as found post-facto in the literature.

TI  - Mining Public Opinions on COVID-19 Vaccination: A Temporal Analysis to Support Combating Misinformation
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE
AB  - This article presents a study that applied opinion analysis about COVID-19 immunization in Brazil. An initial set of 143,615 tweets was collected containing 49,477 pro- and 44,643 anti-vaccination and 49,495 neutral posts. Supervised classifiers (multinomial naive Bayes, logistic regression, linear support vector machines, random forests, adaptative boosting, and multilayer perceptron) were tested, and multinomial naive Bayes, which had the best trade-off between overfitting and correctness, was selected to classify a second set containing 221,884 unclassified tweets. A timeline with the classified tweets was constructed, helping to identify dates with peaks in each polarity and search for events that may have caused the peaks, providing methodological assistance in combating sources of misinformation linked to the spread of anti-vaccination opinion.

TI  - Responses of <i>Castanopsis hystrix</i> seedlings to macronutrient imbalances: Growth, photosynthetic pigments and foliar nutrient interactions
T2  - JOURNAL OF PLANT NUTRITION
AB  - Imbalanced fertilization of nursery stock can lead to nutrient disorders which affect plant quality and productivity. Castanopsis hystrix Miq. is a plantation hardwood species that is being widely established in south China. Nutrient disorders are common in planting stock and difficult to manage, as the causes are unknown. Therefore, macronutrient deletion fertilizer treatments were applied to C. hystrix seedlings and foliar symptoms, growth performance, leaf area, photosynthetic pigments and foliar nutrient interactions were determined. The appearance of foliar symptoms including chlorosis, marginal scorching, necrotic spotting and leaf malformation will be useful for the initial diagnosis of fertilizer imbalances in this species in forest nurseries. Vector analysis revealed that foliar nutrient interactions tended to be enhanced under nutrient imbalance, and these findings may provide a preliminary guideline for confirming macronutrient disorders of this species in nursery production.

TI  - Are multilateral malaria research and control programs the most successful? Lessons from the past 100 years in Africa
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Multilateral malaria research and control programs in Africa have regained prominence recently as bilateral assistance has diminished. The transnational nature of the threat and the need for inspired leadership, good coordination, and new discoveries to decrease the impact of the disease has led to the founding of the Multilateral Initiative on Malaria, the Roll Back Malaria Project, Global Fund for HIV, Tuberculosis and Malaria (Global Fund), the Medicines for Malaria Venture, and the Malaria Vaccine Initiative, among other groups. Historically, the most striking feature of malaria control and elimination activities was the connectedness and balance between malaria research and control especially, from 1892 to 1949. A combination of scientific originality, perseverance in research, integrated approaches, and social concern were the keys for success. The elimination of Anopheles gambiae from Upper Egypt in 1942 using integrated vector control methods is a prime example of malaria control during the first half of the 20th century where those factors were brought together. After 1949, there were three decades of great optimism. Four notable landmarks characterized this period: the Kampala Conference in 1950; the Global Malaria Eradication Program beginning in 1955; the primary health care strategies adopted by most African States after attaining their political independence in the 1960s, and accelerating in the 1980s; and creation of the Special Program in Training and Research in Tropical Diseases at the World Health Organization in 1975. The initial highly encouraging operational results, largely obtained in temperate or subtropical areas where transmission was unstable, engendered undue expectations for the success of identical antimalarial measures elsewhere. Many were convinced that the eradication was in sight, such that support for malaria research virtually ceased. Young, bright scientists were discouraged from seeking a career in a discipline that appeared to soon become superfluous. It took more than three decades to modify antimalarial strategies and to rehabilitate long-term control as an intermediate objective. In Africa, although multilateral malaria programs have grown over the past half century and proved the most successful, fragmentation of co-ordination remains and is a major challenge. The proliferation of malaria programs in the late 1990s has brought substantial additional funds and expertise. However, excessive funding competition and failure of different programs to collaborate has resulted in poor communication and duplication of activities. The capacities of the African nations to conduct high-quality research and to coordinate control efforts are in great jeopardy. There is an urgent need for a non-partisan umbrella organ to coordinate and facilitate the network of alliances and programs in malaria research and control in Africa.

TI  - Epidemiology of cutaneous and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis in Nicaragua
T2  - PARASITE EPIDEMIOLOGY AND CONTROL
AB  - Leishmaniasis is a major neglected tropical disease which contributes a huge economic burden on already meager economic resources. The World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated an annual incidence of 700,000-1,000,000 patients and about 20,000-30,000 deaths per year. Approximately 66,941 patients of cutaneous leishmaniasis are reported annually in the Americas. In recent years, Nicaragua has presented alarmingly high numbers of patients and elevated incidence rates. Unfortunately, there are no detailed spatial descriptions on the epidemiological situation of leishmaniasis in this country. The objective of this study is to present descriptive data about the epidemiology of leishmaniasis in Nicaragua in the context of the distribution of this neglected tropical disease (NTD) in the Americas. This paper also provides an epidemiological update on different forms of leishmaniasis found in the three administrative regions of Nicaragua and its municipalities. Health authorities from the Ministry of Health of Nicaragua (MINSA) provided the entomological and epidemiological information for the different forms of the disease from 2001 to 2018. Prevalence, incidence rates, clinical classification of disease, age groups, sex, and geographic distribution by municipality and department are described in this study.Approximately 90%-95% of the national patients corresponded to CL and 5-10% correspond to MCL. The disease is distributed in the three regions of the country, with a higher burden in the Departments of Jinotega, Matagalpa and Atlantico Norte. The municipalities with the highest proportion of patients were El Cua (23.92%), Waslala (14.16), Santa Maria de Pantasma (9.62%), Rancho Grande (9.03%) and Siuna (7.67%). There is an expansion of spatial distribution of CL and MCL in the North Central and South Atlantic regions of the country. These results could inform interventional strategies to address the burden of leishmaniasis in Nicaragua, whichwould improve the likelihood of meeting the goals for the Leishmaniasis Plan of Action for the Americas.

TI  - Arthritogenic Alphaviruses: A Worldwide Emerging Threat?
T2  - MICROORGANISMS
AB  - Arthritogenic alphaviruses are responsible for a dengue-like syndrome associated with severe debilitating polyarthralgia that can persist for months or years and impact life quality. Chikungunya virus is the most well-known member of this family since it was responsible for two worldwide epidemics with millions of cases in the last 15 years. However, other arthritogenic alphaviruses that are as of yet restrained to specific territories are the cause of neglected tropical diseases: O'nyong'nyong virus in Sub-Saharan Africa, Mayaro virus in Latin America, and Ross River virus in Australia and the Pacific island countries and territories. This review evaluates their emerging potential in light of the current knowledge for each of them and in comparison to chikungunya virus.

TI  - Land-use patterns and their implication on malaria transmission in Kilosa District, Tanzania
T2  - TROPICAL DISEASES TRAVEL MEDICINE AND VACCINES
AB  - Background Understanding of the land use and malaria transmission among farming communities in Tanzania is of great significance. Water resource development projects, deforestation, wetland cultivation, and land use changes for agricultural purposes all expand habitats for malaria-carrying mosquitoes. The main objective of this study was to assess land use patterns and their implication on malaria transmission in two villages in Kilosa District, Tanzania. Methods Multiple research methods were used for data collection, including household interviews using a structured questionnaire; key informant interviews; transect walks and direct field observations. A larval search was conducted using the dipper standard method whereby mosquito larvae and pupae were identified to genus level. Data analysis was undertaken using the Stata software version 10 and descriptive statistics were used. Results A total of 211 diverse mosquito breeding habitats were surveyed during this study. The mosquito breeding sites ranged from small areas such as hoof prints and coconut shells to large ones such as swamps created through anthropogenic activities. The relationships between land use patterns and malaria transmission were statistically insignificant, indicating that malaria transmission in Kilosa could possibly be due to other human activities, including seasonal movement to distant farms during farming seasons. Communities were knowledgeable about malaria preventive measures such as the use of mosquito nets. While knowledge that links mosquitoes and malaria was relatively high among respondents, knowledge related to mosquito ecology and breeding sites was generally low. Conclusion Although analysis of land use patterns did not show statistical significance in the study area, agricultural activities, brick making and settlement seem to be highly linked to malaria transmission. The association of land use patterns and malaria transmission is well observed in habitats created that harbour mosquitoes, and evidenced by presence of immature Anopheles mosquito larvae. Lack of knowledge of the epidemiology of transmission by the inhabitants is a major issue. Although it might be difficult to change land use patterns, as they are driven by economic necessity, future reduction of spread, through better education, is something that could be modified. In addition, more detailed studies are recommended to further confirm the linkages between land use/cover changes and malaria transmission in the study area.

TI  - Occurrence of brown root rot in Ocean Expo Park, Okinawa, Japan: Infection route and preventive control measures
T2  - FOREST PATHOLOGY
AB  - Ocean Expo Park, established in 1976 on subtropical Okinawa Island, Japan, has approximately 8000 planted or naturally grown trees in an area of 77.2 ha. Windfall of these trees occurs mainly due to typhoons; wood chips made from the trunks and roots of windfall trees are commonly used as mulching material throughout the park areas, despite possible infection by pathogenic fungi such as Phellinus noxius, the pathogen causing brown root rot. P. noxius is distributed in tropical and subtropical areas worldwide and has a broad host range. The fungus can infect host plants with mycelia via root-to-root contact or with basidiospores. Here, we report the current status of tree damage caused by brown root rot in the park and infer the infection routes of P. noxius based on microsatellite markers. Among a total of 294 trees surveyed in the park, P. noxius was isolated from 13 trees of five species. P. noxius was observed more frequently on Ficus microcarpa than on other tree species. Ficus superba var. japonica was identified as a new host species, and Bombax ceiba was first recorded as a host plant of P. noxius in Japan. Among the 13 P. noxius isolates from the diseased trees, 2 isolates from adjacent diseased trees were considered to be of the same genet, while the other 11 isolates were different genets, indicating that infection by basidiospores occurred frequently among trees in the entire park, although spread via root systems also occurred between at least two adjacent trees. An identical genet was not detected at distant locations, which suggests that the disease does not spread via chips. However, mulching with chips can lead to wood decay due to decaying fungi other than P. noxius. Therefore, in accordance with the precautionary principle, the park currently prohibits the chipping and mulching of windfall or damaged trees and is considering disposal methods such as burning.

TI  - Study of asparagus production in Western Samoa
T2  - NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF CROP AND HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE
AB  - A tropical variant of the temperate asparagus (Asparagus officinalis L.) production system, thought to have advantages over the Taiwanese "mother fern" method in Western Samoa, was employed in this study. Spears were cut for 7-24 days in the first two harvests and for 30 days in later harvests. All harvesting periods were followed by a 4-month fern growing period. Accumulated yields were significantly (P < 0.05) higher from plants first harvested 11 months after transplanting than hom plants first harvested 7 or 9 months after transplanting. Shorter harvesting periods early in the life of the crop did not improve accumulated yields. In plants first harvested 11 months after transplanting accumulated total yields to the end of the fourth harvest was over 5 t/ha. From the fifth harvest there was a low yield of 0.3 t/ha followed by poor fern growth. The trial was abandoned 1 month after the fifth harvest and plants still appeared free of fungal diseases and insect attack then. Possible causes of reduced longevity and ways of improving longevity in moist tropical conditions are discussed.

TI  - Reconstructing the history of helminth prevalence in the UK
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Author summaryParasitic worms (helminths) cause many health problems in poorer countries, particularly those in tropical and sub-tropical regions. In modern Europe these infections are very rare and mostly found in those travelling from endemic areas but this wasn't always the case. Archaeological studies have detected eggs of parasitic helminths in numerous European sites. Key questions include how prevalent these infections were in past communities and whether (or when) these patterns changed over time? This paper addresses both of these questions using a large number of single grave samples from archaeological sites in England dating between Prehistoric and Industrial periods. Helminth infections were detected across all periods but the overall prevalence rates changed over time, being highest in the Roman and Late-Medieval periods. The Industrial period was interesting in that two of the three sites contained very few (or no) parasites whereas the third, London, contained high levels of infection. We discuss factors that may have contributed to the changing parasite landscape and how understanding these factors may influence efforts to control helminth infections in modern endemic areas.
   Intestinal helminth parasites (worms) have afflicted humans throughout history and their eggs are readily detected in archaeological deposits including at locations where intestinal parasites are no longer considered endemic (e.g. the UK). Parasites provide valuable archaeological insights into historical health, sanitation, hygiene, dietary and culinary practices, as well as other factors. Differences in the prevalence of helminths over time may help us understand factors that affected the rate of infection of these parasites in past populations. While communal deposits often contain relatively high numbers of parasite eggs, these cannot be used to calculate prevalence rates, which are a key epidemiological measure of infection. The prevalence of intestinal helminths was investigated through time in England, based on analysis of 464 human burials from 17 sites, dating from the Prehistoric to Industrial periods. Eggs from two faecal-oral transmitted nematodes (Ascaris sp. and Trichuris sp.) and the food-derived cestodes (Taenia spp. and Diphyllobothrium latum syn Dibothriocephalus latus) were identified, although only Ascaris was detected at a high frequency. The changing prevalence of nematode infections can be attributed to changes in effective sanitation or other factors that affect these faecal-oral transmitted parasites and the presence of cestode infections reflect dietary and culinary preferences. These results indicate that the impact of helminth infections on past populations varied over time, and that some locations witnessed a dramatic reduction in parasite prevalence during the industrial era (18(th)-19(th) century), whereas other locations continued to experience high prevalence levels. The factors underlying these reductions and the variation in prevalence provide a key historical context for modern anthelmintic programs.

   METHODS CSF samples of 700 patients were analysed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect the presence of dengue virus (DENV) RNA and by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect presence of DENV specific IgM.
   FINDINGS DENV infection was detected in 4.3% of the CSF samples; 85.7% (24/28) by DENV IgM and 14.3% (4/28) by viral RNA. DENV detected by viral RNA were to be found serotypes DENV-2 (three patients) and DENV-1 (one patient). The neurological diagnosis in patients CNS infection of DENV included encephalitis (10), meningoencephalitis (10), meningitis (6), acute myelitis (1), and encephalomyelitis (1). The majority (89.3%) had intrathecal inflammation: pleocytosis, hyperproteinorrachia and DENV IgM antibodies. Hypoglycorrhachia and/or high levels of lactate in CSF were found in 36% of the patients. Co-infection (CMV, HIV, Ely, and/or Mycobacterium tuberculosis) was observed in eight (28.6%) cases.
   CONCLUSIONS We found intense inflammatory CSF that is unusual in CNS disorders caused by dengue infection. It may be due co-infections or the immunogenetic background of the local Amerindian Brazilian population. CSF examination is an important diagnostic support tool for neurological dengue diagnosis.

TI  - Clinical and laboratory predictors of 30-day mortality in severe acute malnourished children with severe pneumonia
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE & INTERNATIONAL HEALTH
AB  - Objective To determine the predictors of mortality within 30 days of hospital admission in a diarrhoeal disease hospital in Bangladesh. Methods Cohort study of hospitalised children aged 0-59 months with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) and severe pneumonia in Dhaka Hospital, icddr,b, Bangladesh from April 2015 to March 2017. Those discharged were followed up, and survival status at 30 days from admission was determined. Children who died were compared with the survivors in terms of clinical and laboratory biomarkers. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used for calculating adjusted odds ratio for death within 30 days of hospital admission. Results We enrolled 191 children. Mortality within 30 days of admission was 6% (14/191). After adjusting for potential confounders (hypoxia, CRP and haematocrit) in logistic regression analysis, independent factors associated with death were female sex (aOR = 5.80, 95% CI: 1.34-25.19), LAZ <-4 (aOR = 6.51, 95% CI: 1.49-28.44) and Polymorphonuclear Leucocytes (PMNL) (>6.0 x 10(9)/L) (aOR = 1.06, 95% CI: 1.01-1.11). Using sex, Z-score for length for age (LAZ), and PMNL percentage, we used random forest and linear regression models to achieve a cross-validated AUC of 0.83 (95% CI: 0.82, 0.84) for prediction of 30-day mortality. Conclusions The results of our data suggest that female sex, severe malnutrition (<-4 LAZ) and higher PMNL percentage were prone to be associated with 30-day mortality in children with severe pneumonia. Association of these factors may be used in clinical decision support for prompt identification and appropriate management for prevention of mortality in this population.

TI  - SEROSURVEY OF LEPTOSPIROSIS IN FERAL HOGS (<i>SUS SCROFA</i>) IN FLORIDA
T2  - JOURNAL OF ZOO AND WILDLIFE MEDICINE
AB  - Leptospira is a global pathogen of emerging public health importance in both developing and industrialized nations and can infect almost all mammalian species, including humans. As suburbanization and the popularity of outdoor recreational activities increases, so do human-wildlife and companion animal-wildlife interfaces. Florida offers a tropical climate favorable for outdoor activities and a semirural landscape that sustains an abundant feral hog population. Because no survey of leptospirosis in feral hogs (Sus scrofa) in Florida has been published to our knowledge, we sought to establish preliminary seroprevalence of leptospirosis exposure in feral hogs in Florida. Blood samples were collected opportunistically from 158 male and 166 female feral hogs taken at managed hunts and by permitted trappers in the northern, central, and southern regions of Florida. Samples were then analyzed using the microscopic agglutination test (MAT) for antibody titers to 20 Leptospira serovars representing 17 serogroups. A titer of >1:100 was considered positive; 33% (107/324 total samples) were positive to at least one serovar, and 46% of those were positive to multiple serovars. Antibodies to L. interrogans serovar Bratislava strain Jez Bratislava (serogroup Australis) was the most common, with 18% (58/324) testing positive for antibodies. These initial data indicate that there is a significant possibility of feral hogs having a larger role in the complex etiology of leptospirosis in Florida than historically estimated and that further investigation is warranted.

TI  - The seroprevalence of toxoplasmosis in pigs in Ghana
T2  - ACTA TROPICA
CP  - Seminar on Tropical Zoonoses
AB  - A serological survey of toxoplasmosis in pigs in Ghana was carried out between October 1997 and April 1998 in the three ecological zones of Ghana: the Coastal Savannah, the Forest Belt and the Guinea Savannah. Antibody against Toxoplasma gondii was measured in pig serum using a microplate-ELISA which had a sensitivity and specificity of 90.2 and 92.3%, respectively when compared with IFAT. A national seroprevalence of 39% was obtained in pigs, with the ecological distribution being 43.9, 30.5 and 42.5% for the Coastal Savannah, the Forest Belt and the Guinea Savannah, respectively. The age of the animal, the breed, the environmental conditions and the management practices appeared to be the major determinants of prevalence of antibodies against T. gondii. The prevalence of anti-T: gondii antibodies was found to increase with age (P < 0.05). Pigs from the two Savannah zones had a significantly higher (P < 0.05) antibody prevalence than those sampled from the Forest belt. Antibody prevalence (46.8%) in crossbreed pigs was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than that of the exotic Large White breed (38.8%). (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Fine scale gene flow and individual movements among subpopulations of <i>Centrolene prosoblepon</i> (Anura: Centrolenidae)
T2  - REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL
AB  - Dispersal capabilities determine and maintain local gene flow, and this has implications for population persistence and/or recolonization following environmental perturbations (natural or anthropogenic), disease outbreaks, or other demographic collapses. To predict recolonization and understand dispersal capacity in a stream-breeding frog, we examined individual movement patterns and gene flow among four subpopulations of the Neotropical glassfrog, Centrolene prosoblepon, at a mid-elevation cloud forest site at E1 Cope, Panama. We measured male movement directly during a two year mark-recapture study, and indirectly with gene flow estimates from mitochondrial DNA sequences (mtDNA). Individuals of this species showed strong site fidelity: over two years, male frogs in all four headwater streams moved very little (mean = 2.33 m; mode = 0 m). Nine individuals changed streams within one or two years, moving 675-1 108 in. For those males moving more than 10 in, movement was biased upstream (p < 0.001). Using mtDNA ND1 gene sequences, we quantified gene flow within and among headwater streams at two spatial scales: among headwater streams within two adjacent watersheds (2.5 km) and among streams within a longitudinal gradient covering 5.0 km(2). We found high gene flow among headwater streams (phi(ST) = 0.007, p = 0.325) but gene flow was more limited across greater distances (phi(CT) = 0.322, p = 0.065), even within the same drainage network. Lowland populations of C prosoblepon potentially act as an important source of colonists for upland populations in this watershed.

TI  - DETECTION OF 25-YEAR LAND-COVER CHANGE IN A CRITICAL WATERSHED IN SOUTHERN PHILIPPINES USING LANDSAT MSS AND ETM plus IMAGES: IMPORTANCE IN WATERSHED REHABILITATION
T2  - 100 YEARS ISPRS ADVANCING REMOTE SENSING SCIENCE, PT 1
CP  - ISPRS Technical Commission VII Symposium - 100 Years ISPRS - Advancing Remote Sensing Science
AB  - We analyzed Landsat MSS and ETM+ images to detect 25-year land-cover change (1976-2001) in the critical Taguibo Watershed in Mindanao Island, Southern Philippines. This watershed has experienced historical modifications of its land-cover due to the presence of logging industries in the 1960s, and continuous deforestation due to illegal logging and slash-and-burn agriculture in the present time. To estimate the impacts of land-cover change on watershed runoff, we utilized the land-cover information derived from the Landsat images to parameterize a GIS-based hydrologic model. The model was then calibrated with field-measured discharge data and used to simulate the responses of the watershed in its year 2001 and year 1976 land-cover conditions. The availability of land-cover information on the most recent state of the watershed from the Landsat ETM+ image made it possible to locate areas for rehabilitation such as barren and logged-over areas. We then created a "rehabilitated" land-cover condition map of the watershed (reforestation of logged-over areas and agro-forestation of barren areas) and used it to parameterize the model and predict the runoff responses of the watershed. Model results showed that changes in land-cover from 1976 to 2001 were directly related to the significant increase in surface runoff. Runoff predictions showed that a full rehabilitation of the watershed especially in barren and logged-over areas will likely to reduce the generation of huge volume of runoff during rainfall events. The results of this study have demonstrated the usefulness of multi-temporal Landsat images in detecting land-cover change, in identifying areas for rehabilitation, and in evaluating rehabilitation strategies for management of tropical watersheds through its use in hydrologic modeling.

TI  - The original native pasture ecosystems of the eastern and western Darling Downs - can they be restored?
T2  - TROPICAL GRASSLANDS
CP  - 7th Australian Tropical Pastures Conference
AB  - The original pasture ecosystems of southern inland Queensland ranged from treeless grasslands on cracking clays through grassy woodlands of varying density on a great range of soil types to those competing at the dynamic edges of forests and scrubs. Fire, both wild and aboriginal-managed, was a major factor, along with rainfall extremes, in shaping the pastures and tree:grass balance. Seedling recruitment was driven by rainfall extremes, availability of germinable seed and growing space, with seed availability and space being linked to the timing and intensity of recent fires and rain. The impact of insects, diseases, severe wind and hailstorms on recruitment should not be underestimated.
   The more fertile soils had denser grass growth, greater fire frequency and thinner tree cover than infertile soils, except where trees were so dense that grass growth was almost eliminated. The pastures were dominated by perennial tussock grasses of mid-height but included a wide array of minor herbaceous species whose abundance was linked to soil type and recent seasonal conditions. Many were strongly perennial with Asteraceae, Fabaceae, Malvaceae, Cyperaceae and Goodeniaceae most common in an environment, which can experience effective rainfall at any time of year.
   The former grassland communities that are now productive fanning lands are not easily returned to their original composition. However, conservation of remnant examples of original pasture types is very achievable provided tree density is controlled, prescribed burning and grazing are used and rigorous control of invasive, exotic species is undertaken. This should be done with a clear understanding that significant shortand medium-term fluctuations in botanical composition are normal.

TI  - The landscape of enteric pathogen exposure of young children in public domains of low-income, urban Kenya: The influence of exposure pathway and spatial range of play on multi-pathogen exposure risks
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Young children are infected by a diverse variety of enteric pathogens in low-income, high-burden countries. Little is known about which conditions pose the greatest risk for enteric pathogen exposure and infection. Young children frequently play in residential public areas around their household, including areas contaminated by human and animal feces, suggesting these exposures are particularly hazardous. The objective of this study was to examine how the dose of six types of common enteric pathogens, and the probability of exposure to one or multiple enteric pathogens for young children playing at public play areas in Kisumu, Kenya is influenced by the type and frequency of child play behaviors that result in ingestion of soil or surface water. Additionally, we examine how pathogen doses and multi-pathogen exposure are modified by spatial variability in the number of public areas children are exposed to in their neighborhood. A Bayesian framework was employed to obtain the posterior distribution of pathogen doses for a certain number of contacts. First, a multivariate mixed effects tobit model was used to obtain the posterior distribution of pathogen concentrations, and their interdependencies, in soil and surface water, based upon empirical data of enteric pathogen contamination in three neighborhoods of Kisumu. Then, exposure doses were estimated using behavioral contact parameters from previous studies and contrasted under different exposure conditions. Pathogen presence and concentration in soil varied widely across local (< 25 meter radius area) and neighborhood-level scales, but pathogens were correlated among distinct surface water samples collected near to each other. Multi-pathogen exposure of children at public play areas was common. Pathogen doses and the probability of multi-pathogen ingestion increased with: higher frequency of environmental contact, especially for surface water; larger volume of soil or water ingested; and with play at multiple sites in the neighborhood versus single site play. Child contact with surface water and soil at public play areas in their neighborhood is an important cause of exposure to enteric pathogens in Kisumu, and behavioral, environmental, and spatial conditions are determinants of exposure.
   Author summary The enteric infections that cause diarrheal disease remain a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in young children in low-income settings where sanitation infrastructure is limited. The role of different exposure pathways in transmission of enteric pathogens to young children is unknown, but accurate information on relative risks posed by different pathways could improve how well intervention strategies are prioritized. New evidence reveals that young children often play at public areas in their neighborhood, including areas used for human and animal feces disposal, potentially exposing them to heavily contaminated environmental fomites. We describe a novel exposure assessment approach that examines how the dose of six different enteric pathogens, and the probability of exposure to multiple pathogens is influenced by behavioral, environmental, and spatial conditions in public areas of three low-income, urban neighborhoods of Kisumu, Kenya. We found that increased frequency of contact with the environment and volume of material ingested, especially for surface water, and increased contact with different neighborhood locations elevates dose and probability of multiple pathogen exposure. Our study demonstrates that playing in public areas poses a risk to children and provides new insights on how pathogen exposures vary across transmission pathways.

TI  - Analysis of Patterns of Bushmeat Consumption Reveals Extensive Exploitation of Protected Species in Eastern Madagascar
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Understanding the patterns of wild meat consumption from tropical forests is important for designing approaches to address this major threat to biodiversity and mitigate potential pathways for transmission of emerging diseases. Bushmeat consumption has been particularly poorly studied in Madagascar, one of the world's hottest biodiversity hotspots. Studying bushmeat consumption is challenging as many species are protected and researchers must consider the incentives faced by informants. Using interviews with 1154 households in 12 communes in eastern Madagascar, as well as local monitoring data, we investigated the importance of socio-economic variables, taste preference and traditional taboos on consumption of 50 wild and domestic species. The majority of meals contain no animal protein. However, respondents consume a wide range of wild species and 95% of respondents have eaten at least one protected species (and nearly 45% have eaten more than 10). The rural/urban divide and wealth are important predictors of bushmeat consumption, but the magnitude and direction of the effect varies between species. Bushmeat species are not preferred and are considered inferior to fish and domestic animals. Taboos have provided protection to some species, particularly the Endangered Indri, but we present evidence that this taboo is rapidly eroding. By considering a variety of potential influences on consumption in a single study we have improved understanding of who is eating bushmeat and why. Evidence that bushmeat species are not generally preferred meats suggest that projects which increase the availability of domestic meat and fish may have success at reducing demand. We also suggest that enforcement of existing wildlife and firearm laws should be a priority, particularly in areas undergoing rapid social change. The issue of hunting as an important threat to biodiversity in Madagascar is only now being fully recognised. Urgent action is required to ensure that heavily hunted species are adequately protected.

TI  - Diversity and abundance of soil macroinvertebrates along a contamination gradient in the Central Urals, Russia
T2  - BIODIVERSITY DATA JOURNAL
AB  - Background Since the late 1980s, long-term monitoring of terrestrial ecosystems in metal-contaminated areas near the Middle Ural Copper Smelter has been carried out in the Central Urals. As a part of these monitoring programmes, the data on species diversity, community composition and abundance of soil macroinvertebrates continue to be gathered. New information The dataset (available from the GBIF network at https://www.gbif.org/dataset/ 61e92984-382b-4158-be6b-e391c7ed5a64) includes a 2004 census for soil macroinvertebrates of spruce-fir forests along a pollution gradient in the Central Urals. The dataset describes soil macrofauna's abundance (the number of individuals per sample, i.e. the density) and community structure (list of supraspecific taxa, list of species for most abundant taxa and supraspecific taxa or species abundance). Seventeen sampling plots differed in the levels of toxic metal (Cu, Zn, Pb, Cd and Fe) soil contamination from air emissions of the Middle Ural Copper Smelter (heavily polluted, moderately polluted and unpolluted areas). The dataset consists of 340 sampling events (= samples corresponding to upper and lower layers of the 170 soil monoliths) and 64658 rows (2907 and 61751 for non-zero and zero density of taxa, respectively). Arachnida (Araneae and Opiliones), Carabidae (imagoes), Elateridae (larvae), Chilopoda, Diplopoda, Gastropoda, Staphylinidae (imagoes) and Lumbricidae were identified to species level. In contrast, Mermithida, Enchytraeidae, Lepidoptera larvae, Diptera larvae, Hemiptera, Hymenoptera and some other insects were identified to family or order levels. In total, 8430 individuals of soil macroinvertebrates were collected in two soil layers (organic and organic-mineral horizons), including 1046 Arachnida (spiders and harvestmen), 45 Carabidae, 300 Elateridae, 529 Myriapoda, 741 Gastropoda, 437 Staphylinidae, 623 Lumbricidae and 4709 other invertebrates. The presence-absence data on each taxon are provided for each sampling event. An overwhelming majority of such absences can be interpreted as "pseudo-absences" at the scale of sampling plots or study sites. The dataset contains information helpful for long-term ecotoxicological monitoring of forest ecosystems and contributes to studying soil macrofauna diversity in the Urals.

TI  - Short report:: Absence of <i>Leishmania</i> in Guianan bats
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Studying the ecology of Leishmania parasites is essential for understanding and controlling the epidemiology of the diseases they cause. Despite their abundance and diversity in neotropical forests, few studies have been conducted to investigate the potential involvement of Chiroptera in the Leishmania pathogenic complexes. However, phlebotomine sand flies are known to colonize the same anthropized habitat, are attracted to bats, and are able to transmit trypanosomatids. Thus, 216 bats representing 29 species were sampled in the field in different primary and secondary forests of French Guiana where human cutaneous leishmaniases have been reported, together with 62 non-volant mammals. A series of 411 tissue samples representing 47 mammalian species were cultured and screened for the presence of Leishmania spp. by a genus-specific polymerase chain reaction. All 278 individuals surveyed were negative. Thus, bats do not appear to be involved in the Lishmania parasitic cycles in the Guyanas.

TI  - Dengue Vector Dynamics (<i>Aedes aegypti</i>) Influenced by Climate and Social Factors in Ecuador: Implications for Targeted Control
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Background: Dengue fever, a mosquito-borne viral disease, is now the fastest spreading tropical disease globally. Previous studies indicate that climate and human behavior interact to influence dengue virus and vector (Aedes aegypti) population dynamics; however, the relative effects of these variables depends on local ecology and social context. We investigated the roles of climate and socio-ecological factors on Ae. aegypti population dynamics in Machala, a city in southern coastal Ecuador where dengue is hyper-endemic.
   Methods/Principal findings: We studied two proximate urban localities where we monitored weekly Ae. aegypti oviposition activity (Nov. 2010-June 2011), conducted seasonal pupal surveys, and surveyed household to identify dengue risk factors. The results of this study provide evidence that Ae. aegypti population dynamics are influenced by social risk factors that vary by season and lagged climate variables that vary by locality. Best-fit models to predict the presence of Ae. aegypti pupae included parameters for household water storage practices, access to piped water, the number of households per property, condition of the house and patio, and knowledge and perceptions of dengue. Rainfall and minimum temperature were significant predictors of oviposition activity, although the effect of rainfall varied by locality due to differences in types of water storage containers.
   Conclusions: These results indicate the potential to reduce the burden of dengue in this region by conducting focused vector control interventions that target high-risk households and containers in each season and by developing predictive models using climate and non-climate information. These findings provide the region's public health sector with key information for conducting time and location-specific vector control campaigns, and highlight the importance of local socio-ecological studies to understand dengue dynamics.

TI  - Field evaluation of zero vector durable lining to assess its efficacy against malaria vectors and malaria transmission in tribal areas of the Balaghat district of central India
T2  - TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Background: Indoor residual spray (IRS) and long-lasting insecticidal nets are the two principal intervention methods of vector control. Zero vector durable lining (ZVDL), a relatively new vector control method, was evaluated to assess its efficacy against malaria vectors in hard to reach areas in the Balaghat district, where malaria transmission is perennial.
   Methods: ZVDL was installed in six experimental villages during November-December 2012. In control villages, IRS was carried out with Alphacypermethrin. Cone bioassays were performed to assess the efficacy and persistence of insecticide-treated ZVDL following WHO bioassays.
   Results: The mean per man hour density of Anopheles caught during 2013 was 12.1 in experimental villages and 16.2 in control villages. No sporozoite-positive Anopheles culicifacies were found in experimental villages; however, in control villages, four sporozoite-positive A. culicifacies were found (two Plasmodium vivax and two P. falciparum). The knock-down rate of A. culicifacies was 95-100% with 100% mortality during the 24 h recovery period. Malaria declined sharply in experimental villages showing a slide positivity rate of 22.3% compared with control villages (36.4%) (p<0.05).
   Conclusions: A supplementary vector control intervention such as ZVDL has the potential to become a viable alternative to IRS in malaria endemic areas.

TI  - Risk prediction of two types of potential snail habitats in Anhui Province of China: Model-based approaches
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Elimination of the intermediate snail host of Schistosoma is the most effective way to control schistosomiasis and the most important first step is to accurately identify the snail habitats. Due to the substantial resources required for traditional, manual snail-searching in the field, and potential risk of miss-classification of potential snail habitats by remote sensing, more convenient and precise methods are urgently needed. Snail data (N = 15,000) from two types of snail habitats (lake/marshland and hilly areas) in Anhui Province, a typical endemic area for schistosomiasis, were collected together with 36 environmental variables covering the whole province. Twelve different models were built and evaluated with indices, such as area under the curve (AUC), Kappa, percent correctly classified (PCC), sensitivity and specificity. We found the presence-absence models performing better than those based on presence-only. However, those derived from machine-learning, especially the random forest (RF) approach were preferable with all indices above 0.90. Distance to nearest river was found to be the most important variable for the lake/marshlands, while the climatic variables were more important for the hilly endemic areas. The predicted high-risk areas for potential snail habitats of the lake/marshland type exist mainly along the Yangtze River, while those of the hilly type are dispersed in the areas south of the Yangtze River. We provide here the first comprehensive risk profile of potential snail habitats based on precise examinations revealing the true distribution and habitat type, thereby improving efficiency and accuracy of snail control including better allocation of limited health resources.
   Author summary
   Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease caused by parasitic worms of the genus Schistosoma. In China, the sole intermediate snail host is Oncomelania hupensis whose elimination has proved to be the most effective way to interrupt this disease. However, manual snail-searching is labour-intensive, expensive and time-consuming and can lead to inaccurate results. For a better approach, 12 models were employed and compared to characterise the typical snail habitats that vary between the lake/marshlands and the hilly areas. We found that the two types of snail habitats showed notable differences during the modelling process, mainly due to the impact of environmental variables that can form different types of habitats. We further found that habitat characterization contributed to better prediction of areas at risk, and that the precision was high, especially of models based on machine-learning algorithms such as random forest (RF). The highest level of accuracy was achieved by the support vector machine (SVM) approach and artificial neural networks (ANN). Our study provides new insights into accurate prediction of the spatial distribution of potential snail habitats with machine-learning as the preferred approach.

TI  - A hidden deadly venomous insect: First eco-epidemiological assessment and risk mapping of lonomism in Argentina
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Author summary Caterpillars of the genus Lonomia (Saturniidae: Hemileucinae) are considered the world's most deadly lepidopterans. Due to the increasing number of cases and the lack of antivenom therapy, envenomation by these animals constitutes an emerging and somewhat neglected public health issue in Argentina and neighboring countries. Our research has determined the eco-epidemiological scenario of such an envenomation in the Argentine province of Misiones-mainly covered by the Atlantic Forest (a suitable biome for L. obliqua)-, and identified some predictors to occurrences/accidents with this insect. This study also provides the first map of the potential risk of lonomism in this province, which has several natural attractions visited by millions of tourists worldwide. We discussed our findings in light of immediate response from health authorities to outline preventive strategies for accidents and conservation of this venomous lepidopteran in its ecological niche.
   Background Envenomation by the South American Lonomia saturniid caterpillars, named lonomism, constitutes an emerging and somewhat neglected public health issue in Argentina and neighboring countries. Considering that there is an intricate relationship between environment and human health in such cases, this study aimed to analyze the eco-epidemiological profile of 40 accidents and 33 occurrences of Lonomia spp. in Misiones (Argentina) between January 2014 and May 2020. Methodology/Principal findings We described the eco-epidemiological variables and characterized the abiotic scenario of such cases. Additionally, we obtained a density map that shows the punctual intensity of Lonomia records throughout Misiones. Most of the accidents occurred in the Department of Guarani and involved male victims younger than 20 years old. The accidental/occasional occurrence of Lonomia spp. (considering both adult and caterpillar stages together) was significantly higher in the rural area, whereas only adult specimens were found in urban areas. We determined that the presence of this insect in Misiones is positively related to higher temperatures and solar radiation, and larger precipitation and evapotranspiration throughout the year. Conclusion/Significance This study represents an initial step towards the global understanding of lonomism as a public health problem in Argentina. It provides a map of the risk level for this envenomation in Misiones, which could help authorities address public health policy efforts to implement sustainable strategies for prevention and response to this threat in Northeastern Argentina and neighboring regions.

TI  - <i>Rhamnus crenata</i> leaf extracts exhibit anti-inflammatory activity via modulating the Nrf2/HO-1 and NF-?B/MAPK signaling pathways
T2  - ASIAN PACIFIC JOURNAL OF TROPICAL BIOMEDICINE
AB  - Objective: To elucidate the potential anti-inflammatory mechanisms of Rhamnus crenata leaf extracts using RAW264.7 cells. Methods: We used 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay to measure cell viability. Nitric oxide (NO) production was measured using Griess reagent. Western blotting and RT-PCR assays were carried out for analyzing the protein and gene expressions of pro-inflammatory mediators, respectively. Moreover, PD98059 (ERK1/2 inhibitor), SB203580 (p38 inhibitor), SP600125 (JNK inhibitor), and BAY11-7082 (NF-kappa B inhibitor) were used to evaluate the anti-inflammatory mechanism of Rhamnus crenata leaf extract. Results: Rhamnus crenata leaf extracts significantly inhibited the production of the pro-inflammatory mediators such as NO, iNOS, COX-2, IL-1 beta, and TNF-alpha in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. Rhamnus crenata leaf extracts also suppressed LPS-induced degradation of I kappa B-alpha and nuclear accumulation of p65, which resulted in the inhibition of NF-kappa B activation in RAW264.7 cells. Additionally, the extracts attenuated the phosphorylation of p38, ERK1/2, and JNK in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. Moreover, HO-1 expression induced by Rhamnus crenata leaf extracts was significantly downregulated by SB230580, PD98059, SP600125 and BAY11-7082. Conclusions: Rhamnus crenata leaf extract may upregulate HO-1 expression through inhibition of p38, ERK1/2, and NF-kappa B activation, which may contribute to the anti-inflammatory activity of the extracts. Rhamnus crenata leaf extracts may have great potential for the development of anti-inflammatory drugs to treat acute and chronic inflammatory diseases.

TI  - Cassava Genetic Transformation and its Application in Breeding
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE PLANT BIOLOGY
AB  - As a major source of food, cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) is an important root crop in the tropics and subtropics of Africa and Latin America, and serves as raw material for the production of starches and bioethanol in tropical Asia. Cassava improvement through genetic engineering not only overcomes the high heterozygosity and serious trait separation that occurs in its traditional breeding, but also quickly achieves improved target traits. Since the first report on genetic transformation in cassava in 1996, the technology has gradually matured over almost 15 years of development and has overcome cassava genotype constraints, changing from mode cultivars to farmer-preferred ones. Significant progress has been made in terms of an increased resistance to pests and diseases, biofortification, and improved starch quality, building on the fundamental knowledge and technologies related to planting, nutrition, and the processing of this important food crop that has often been neglected. Therefore, cassava has great potential in food security and bioenergy development worldwide.

TI  - Distribution and abundance of black flies (Diptera: Simuliidae) in recreation parks in Selangor State, Peninsular Malaysia
T2  - TROPICAL BIOMEDICINE
AB  - A preliminary survey of larvae and pupae of black flies (Diptera: Simuliidae) was conducted in three recreation parks [Templer Recreation Park (TRP), Congkak River Forest Reserve (CRFR) and Ampang Forest Reserve (AFR)] located in Selangor State, which is located 18 to 35 km from Kuala Lumpur city center, Malaysia. This study was initiated to determine the distribution and abundance of filarial vectors, Simulium spp. A total of 12 species of black flies belonging to three subgenera (Gomphostilbia, Simulium and Nevermannia) were collected. Simulium (Simulium) nobile was incriminated as the most dominant species in all recreation parks. This study is a first report on the distribution and abundance of black flies obtained from recreation parks in Malaysia.

TI  - Ecotype Evolution in <i>Glossina palpalis</i> Subspecies, Major Vectors of Sleeping Sickness
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   The role of environmental factors in driving adaptive trajectories of living organisms is still being debated. This is even more important to understand when dealing with important neglected diseases and their vectors.
   Methodology/Principal Findings
   In this paper, we analysed genetic divergence, computed from seven microsatellite loci, of 614 tsetse flies (Glossina palpalis gambiensis and Glossina palpalis palpalis, major vectors of animal and human trypanosomes) from 28 sites of West and Central Africa. We found that the two subspecies are so divergent that they deserve the species status. Controlling for geographic and time distances that separate these samples, which have a significant effect, we found that G. p. gambiensis from different landscapes (Niayes of Senegal, savannah and coastal environments) were significantly genetically different and thus represent different ecotypes or subspecies. We also confirm that G. p. palpalis from Ivory Coast, Cameroon and DRC are strongly divergent.
   Conclusions/Significance
   These results provide an opportunity to examine whether new tsetse fly ecotypes might display different behaviour, dispersal patterns, host preferences and vectorial capacities. This work also urges a revision of taxonomic status of Glossina palpalis subspecies and highlights again how fast ecological divergence can be, especially in host-parasite-vector systems.

TI  - Expanding an expanded genome: long-read sequencing of <i>Trypanosoma cruzi</i>
T2  - MICROBIAL GENOMICS
AB  - Although the genome of Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, was first made available in 2005, with additional strains reported later, the intrinsic genome complexity of this parasite (the abundance of repetitive sequences and genes organized in tandem) has traditionally hindered high-quality genome assembly and annotation. This also limits diverse types of analyses that require high degrees of precision. Long reads generated by third-generation sequencing technologies are particularly suitable to address the challenges associated with T. cruzi's genome since they permit direct determination of the full sequence of large clusters of repetitive sequences without collapsing them. This, in turn, not only allows accurate estimation of gene copy numbers but also circumvents assembly fragmentation. Here, we present the analysis of the genome sequences of two T. cruzi clones: the hybrid TCC (TcVI) and the non-hybrid Dm28c (Id), determined by PacBio Single Molecular Real-Time (SMRT) technology. The improved assemblies herein obtained permitted us to accurately estimate gene copy numbers, abundance and distribution of repetitive sequences (including satellites and retroelements). We found that the genome of T. cruzi is composed of a 'core compartment' and a 'disruptive compartment' which exhibit opposite GC content and gene composition. Novel tandem and dispersed repetitive sequences were identified, including some located inside coding sequences. Additionally, homologous chromosomes were separately assembled, allowing us to retrieve haplotypes as separate contigs instead of a unique mosaic sequence. Finally, manual annotation of surface multigene families, mucins and trans-sialidases allows now a better overview of these complex groups of genes.

T2  - AUSTRALIAN SYSTEMATIC BOTANY
AB  - A survey of fungal species occurring on plants in Acacia and Eucalyptus seed production areas (SPAs) established at Yapilika, Melville Island, Northern Territory, as well as in the surrounding native vegetation was conducted. A total of 21 fungal species representing 18 genera of Ascomycotina (63.6%) and Deuteromycotina (36.4%) was collected. Among them, 10 species are newly recorded from Australia, Cryptovalsa cf. protracta, Dinemasporium strigosum, Eutypella scoparia, Hypoxylon rubigineo-areolatum, Leptosphaeria sp., Pestalotiopsis acaciae, P. neglecta, Pseudocercospora sp., Rhytidhysteron rufulum and Valsaria insitiva, and seven species are proposed as new: Botryosphaeria appendiculata, Coleophoma eucalypti, Hyponectria grevilleae, H. syzygii, Pseudocercospora erythrophlei, Stomiopeltis acaciae and Trichonectria syzygii. Most fungi collected in the survey are foliar pathogens. Leaf diseases of Acacia spp. and Eucalyptus pellita were commonly found in SPAs during the investigation. Most stem fungi were saprophytes. Only one, B. appendiculata, was found to be associated with dieback of Eucalyptus pellita. It is a potential stem canker pathogen of tropical eucalypts. Descriptions and illustrations for each new species and new Australian records are given.

TI  - Phlebotomine sand flies (Diptera: Psychodidae: Phlebotominae) in urban rainforest fragments, Manaus - Amazonas State, Brazil
T2  - ACTA TROPICA
AB  - The non-flooded upland rainforest fragment in the Federal University of Amazonas Campus is considered one of the world's largest urban tropical woodland areas and Brazil's second largest one in an urban setting. It is located in the city of Manaus, State of Amazonas at 03 degrees 04' 34 '' S, 59 degrees 57' 30 '' W, in an area covering nearly 800 hectares. Forty-one (41) sand fly species belonging to genus Lutzomyia were found attaining a total of 4662 specimens collected. Lutzomyia umbratilis was the dominant species at all heights, followed by Lutzomyia anduzei and Lutzomyia claustrei. The fauna alpha diversity index showed to be 6.4, which is not much lower than that reported for areas of continuous forest in this Amazonian region. This data provides additional evidence on Phlebotomine sand flies found to transmit Leishmania and other trypanosomatids to humans and other animals circulating in this area. This is the first study being reported on sand flies collected in an urban rainforest fragment in Amazonia. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

T2  - IATREIA
AB  - Tick-borne viruses (TBVs) belong to the Flaviviridae, Bunyaviridae, Reoviridae, Asfarviridae and Orthomyxoviridae families and cause different diseases in humans and animals. Due to the epidemiologic relevance of TBVs, this review highlights the actual knowledge of these agents and the diseases they cause, besides of the prevention and treatment strategies implemented so far. It is evident that studies that address the TBVs present in the Neotropical region are missing, since most of the studies, both reviews and original articles, present data from the Nearctic and Palearctic regions. Considering the current picture of the TBVs studies in the Neotropical area and its peculiarities, is probable that other not yet identified TBVs exist in this zone and have an impact in public health.

TI  - Accuracy of the health information system on malaria surveillance in Vietnam
T2  - TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - The health information system (HIS) is a key component of control programs and its accuracy is necessary for the assessment of disease risks, the formulation of priorities and the evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of different interventions. In order to assess the quality of the HIS in estimating malaria morbidity in Vietnam, we compared data obtained by a 2-year active (ACD) and passive case detection (PCD) study with those routinely collected at the local commune health centres (CHC) at three sites having different malaria epidemiology. The majority of malaria cases (80-95%) detected by ACD were missed by the HIS. Similarly, most malaria cases (50-90%) detected by PCD were also missed by the HIS, and this was proportional to the number of active private practitioners. Reasons for this low sensitivity are low CHC attendance, high attendance at private health facilities, widespread self-medication and attendance at central health facilities. In conclusion, although malaria has sharply decreased in Vietnam over the past 10 years, the current HIS greatly underestimates the malaria burden. Involvement of the private sector and the establishment of sentinel sites might improve the quality of data and the relevance of HIS in malaria control.

TI  - Prediction and mapping of land degradation in the Batanghari watershed, Sumatra, Indonesia: utilizing multi-source geospatial data and machine learning modeling techniques
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
AB  - In the present study, the Geospatial Artificial Intelligence (Geo-AI) is proposed to overcome challenges and phenomena related to land degradation identification in the field by integrating multi-source geospatial data and machine learning modeling techniques. The study area is located in the Batanghari watershed, Sumatra, Indonesia, which is a tropical environment. The existence of environmental problems in the study area can be identified based on land degradation. This study's novelty model is that it is the first to integrate the six main variables of multi-source geospatial data-topographical, biophysical, bioclimatic, geo-environmental, global human modification, and accessibility-in predicting and mapping the potential of land degradation in Indonesia's tropical environment. Support Vector Machine (SVM), Minimum Distance (MD), Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Gradient Tree Boost (GTB), Naive Bayes (NB), Random Forest (RF) are machine learning modeling algorithms used to predic and map land degradation in the study area. The prediction results from these modeling algorithms can be compared and evaluated to get the most optimal performance and accuracy. During the modeling phase, 70% of the reference data were divided into training and 30% into validation. The performance of the model was compared using three accuracy assessment processes (producer accuracy, user accuracy, and overall accuracy). The overall accuracy of the results of the comparison and evaluation of machine learning modeling on the SVM, MD, CART, GTB, NB, and RF algorithms in the study area are 52.8, 34.5, 81.2, 85.8, 36.3, and 86.2%, respectively. Therefore, the study concluded that the RF, CART, and GTB are machine learning modeling algorithms that were proposed to be applied and to produce a land degradation map in the study area. The results of this study can be used by policymakers in making decisions related to environmental management, ecosystem rehabilitation, and restoration. Technically, this can also be applied to other watersheds with similar characteristics. In addition, the results of this study can also be used to develop an intelligent watershed monitoring system to effectively monitor land cover change.

TI  - Morbidity of Chagas disease among autochthonous patients from the Rio Negro microregion, State of Amazonas
T2  - REVISTA DA SOCIEDADE BRASILEIRA DE MEDICINA TROPICAL
AB  - Introduction. A seroepidemiological and clinical study was conducted on 152 autochthonous individuals living in the district of Barcelos, State of Amazonas, to evaluate the seroprevalence of Chagas infection and morbidity of Chagas disease. Methods. The serological tests used were indirect immunofluorescence, conventional and recombinant ELISA and immunoblot (Tesa-blot). Thirty-eight patients were considered seropositive; 31 were considered serodoubtful; and 83 were considered seronegative. The 38 seropositive cases were paired with 38 seronegative controls of the same age and sex, and underwent epidemiological and clinical evaluations, electrocardiograms and echocardiograms. Twenty-nine pairs underwent radiological examinations of the esophagus. Results. Seropositivity was 19.9 times more frequent among workers gathering plant materials from the forests and 10.4 times more frequent among piassaba gatherers. Eighty six point seven percent of the seropositive individuals recognized the genus Rhodnius as the local vector, while only 34.2% of the seronegative individuals recognized this. The EKG was abnormal in 36.8% of the seropositive individuals and in 21.5% of the seronegative individuals, while the echocardiogram showed abnormalities in 31.6% of the seropositive and 18.4% of the seronegative individuals. Precordialgia and palpitation were more frequent among the seropositive individuals. Clinical evaluation on the digestive system and X-ray on the esophagus did not show significant abnormalities. Conclusions. Chagas disease in the study region can be considered to be an occupational disease.

TI  - Genetic relationships among Mayaro and Una viruses suggest distinct patterns of transmission
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Mayaro and Una viruses (MAYV, UNAV) are mosquito-borne alphaviruses that may cause an acute febrile illness characterized by headache, retro-orbital pain, and rash that may progress to a severe and prolonged arthralgia. MAYV was first isolated in Trinidad in 1954, and UNAV was first identified in northern Brazil in 1959. Since then, numerous isolates of these agents have been made from humans, wild vertebrates, and mosquitoes in several countries in northern South America. Serological evidence suggests that these viruses are also present in portions of Central America. Because little is known about the natural transmission cycle of MAYV and virtually nothing is known about UNAV transmission, 63 isolates covering the known geographic and temporal ranges were used in phylogenetic analyses to aid in understanding the molecular epidemiology. Approximately 2 kb from the El and E2 glycoprotein genes and the complete 3' non-coding region were sequenced. Phylogenetic analyses of these sequences indicated that two distinct genotypes of MAYV exist with a distinct clade consisting exclusively of UNAV (previously designated as a subtype of MAYV). One MAYV genotype (genotype D) contains isolates from Trinidad and the northcentral portion of South America including Peru, French Guiana, Surinam, Brazil, and Bolivia. All of these isolates are highly conserved with a nucleotide divergence of < 6%. The second MAYV genotype (genotype L) contains isolates only from Brazil that are highly conserved (< 4% nucleotide divergence) but are quite distinct (15-19%) from the first genotype isolates. These analyses provide possible explanations for the natural ecology and transmission of MAYV and UNAV.

AB  - Calamus castaneus is a common rattan palm species in the tropical forests of Peninsular Malaysia and is noticeable by the yellow-based spines that cover the stems. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of fungal endophytes within C. castaneus spines and whether they inhibit the growth of fungal pathogens. Twenty-one genera with 40 species of fungal endophytes were isolated and identified from rattan palm spines. Based on molecular identification, the most common isolates recovered from the spines were Colletotrichum (n = 19) and Diaporthe spp. (n = 18), followed by Phyllosticta spp., Xylaria sp., Trichoderma spp., Helminthosporium spp., Penicillium spp., Fusarium spp., Neopestalotiopsis spp., Arthrinium sp., Cyphellophora sp., Cladosporium spp., Curvularia sp., Bionectria sp., and Acremonium spp. Non-sporulating fungi were also identified, namely Nemania primolutea, Pidoplitchkoviella terricola, Muyocopron laterale, Acrocalymma fici, Acrocalymma medicaginis, and Endomelanconiopsis endophytica. The isolation of these endophytes showed that the spines harbor endophytic fungi. Most of the fungal endophytes inhibited the growth of several plant pathogenic fungi, with 68% of the interactions resulting in mutual inhibition, producing a clear inhibition zone of C. castaneus spines as biocontrol agents.

TI  - Imagined Ecologies: A More-Than-Human History of Malaria in the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area, New South Wales, Australia, 1919-45
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL HISTORY
AB  - In eastern inland Australia, the significant redistribution of water in the Murray River system for irrigated agriculture from the late nineteenth century created new ecological dynamics. At the same time, scientific research into mosquito-borne diseases also increased. Scientific proof of the life cycle of malaria in the late nineteenth century, and subsequent research into this and other mosquito-borne diseases, changed people's relationships with watery landscapes, including irrigation areas, as well as with mosquitoes. Wetlands were no longer just dangerous to visit but could come out into the world, onto farms, and into homes via these insects. Within these contexts, this article examines changing understandings of mosquitoes and irrigation systems in light of a series of investigations into the possibility of an outbreak of malaria in the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area between 1919 and 1945. Using the concept of imagined ecologies, it examines the way that particular understandings of nonhumans were and are world-making. It particularly analyzes the shifting biocultural terrains of the borders between agriculture and "nature," and the home and nonhumans, as well as approaches to race and health, as mosquitoes were now seen to bring tropical diseases to the climatically and socially idealized temperate inland. Underpinned by powerful political and social goals, these watery farming areas could not be drained like other wetlands, presenting possible new medical, ecological, and ideological challenges.

TI  - The effect of cassava mosaic disease on the genetic diversity of cassava in Uganda
T2  - EUPHYTICA
AB  - Cassava (Manihot esculenta) is a tropical crop that is grown in Africa, Latin America and Southeast Asia. Cassava was introduced from Latin America into West and East Africa at two independent events. In Uganda a serious threat to cassava's survival is the cassava mosaic disease (CMD). Uganda has had two notable CMD epidemics since the introduction of cassava in the 1850s causing severe losses. SSR markers were used to study the effect of CMD on the genetic diversity in five agroecologies in Uganda with high and low incidence of CMD. Surprisingly, high gene diversity was detected. Most of the diversity was found within populations, while the diversity was very small among agroecological zones and the high and low CMD incidence areas. The high genetic diversity suggests a mechanism by which diversity is maintained by the active involvement of the Ugandan farmer in continuously testing and adopting new genotypes that will serve their diverse needs. However, in spite of the high genetic diversity we found a loss of rare alleles in areas with high CMD incidence. To study the effect of the introgression history on the gene pool the genetic differentiation between East and West Africa was also studied. Genetic similarities were found between the varieties in Uganda and Tanzania in East Africa and Ghana in West Africa. Thus, there is no evidence for a differentiation of the cassava gene pool into a western and an eastern genetic lineage. However, a possible difference in the genetic constitution of the introduced cassava into East and West Africa may have been diminished by germplasm movement.

TI  - Sandfly frequency in a clean and well-organized rural environment in the state of Parana, Brazil
T2  - REVISTA DA SOCIEDADE BRASILEIRA DE MEDICINA TROPICAL
AB  - Introduction: Sandflies caught in Santa Juliana Farm in Sarandi, state of Parana, Brazil, were assessed in terms of their fauna, seasonality, and frequency in the homes and in shelters of domestic animals around the homes, as well as in the nearby forest. Methods: In Santa Juliana Farm, there are no records of cases of ACL, differing from other relatively clean and organized areas where surveys of sandflies have been conducted in Parana. Samples were collected with Falcao light traps, fortnightly from 22:00 to 02:00 hours, from November 2007 to November 2008. Results: A total of 4,506 sandflies were captured, representing 13 species, predominantly Nyssomyia whitmani (71.8%). More sandflies were collected in the forest (52.6%) than outside the forest (residences and pigsty) (47.4%). However, Ny. whitmani was collected in greater numbers outside (38.3%) than inside the forest (33.5%). Most sandflies were collected in the warmer months and during periods with regular rainfall. Conclusions: The results suggest that cleaning and organization around the houses could reduce sandfly population in peridomicile. Constructing shelters for animal at a distance of approximately 100m from domiciles is recommended to prevent the invasion of sandflies, as this farm has an area of preserved forest, with wild animals and sandflies present to maintain the enzootic cycle of Leishmania.

TI  - Challenges in primary care for diabetes and hypertension: an observational study of the Kolar district in rural India
T2  - BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
AB  - BackgroundChronic diseases have emerged as the leading cause of death globally, and 20% of Indians are estimated to suffer from a chronic condition. Care for chronic diseases poses a major public health challenge, especially when health care delivery has been geared traditionally towards acute care. In this study, we aimed to better understand how primary care for diabetes and hypertension is currently organised in first-line health facilities in rural India, and propose evidence-based ways forward for strengthening local health systems to address chronic problems.MethodsWe used qualitative and quantitative methods to gain insight into how care is organised and how patients and providers manage within this delivery system. We conducted in-depth interviews with the medical doctors working in three private clinics and in three public primary health centres. We also interviewed 24 patients with chronic diseases receiving care in the two sub-sectors. Non-participant observations and facility assessments were performed to triangulate the findings from the interviews.ResultsThe current delivery system has many problems impeding the delivery of quality care for chronic conditions. In both the public and private facilities studied, the care processes are very doctor-centred, with little room for other health centre staff. Doctors face very high workloads, especially in the public sector, jeopardising proper communication with patients and adequate counselling. In addition, the health information system is fragmented and provides little or no support for patient follow-up and self-management. The patient is largely left on their own in trying to make sense of their condition and in finding their way in a complex and scattered health care landscape.ConclusionsThe design and organisation of care for persons with chronic diseases in India needs to be rethought. More space and responsibility should be given to the primary care level, and relatively less to the more specialised hospital level. Furthermore, doctors should consider delegating some of their tasks to other staff in the first-line health facility to significantly reduce their workload and increase time available for communication. The health information system needs to be adapted to better ensure continuity of care and support self-management by patients.

TI  - Multilocus genotyping of '<i>Candidatus</i> Phytoplasma aurantifolia' associated with witches' broom disease in <i>Citrus</i> spp.
T2  - TROPICAL PLANT PATHOLOGY
AB  - Witches' broom disease of lime (WBDL), associated with 'Candidatus Phytoplasma aurantifolia,' is a serious disease of acid lime in Southern Iran. In order to characterize 'Ca. P. aurantifolia' strains, a multilocus sequence analysis protocol was developed based on different genomic loci, including 16S rRNA, 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer (IS), ribosomal protein genes rpl22 and rps3, cell division protein, and group II intron reverse transcriptase/mature gene, in 46 phytoplasma strains. Analyses of virtual RFLP, phylogenetics, and DNA sequence identity of 16S rRNA of Iranian phytoplasma strains associated with symptomatic citrus plants indicated that the Iranian strains were classified in ribosomal subgroup 16SrII-B. In total, three genotypes were recognized based on 16Sr virtual RFLP profiles. Phylogenetic analysis based on the rp and ftsH gene sequences showed clustering of all the strains as one group. Comparative sequence and phylogenetic analysis of group II intron genes indicated the highest differentiation of 'Ca. P. aurantifolia'-related strains in four genotypes. The polymorphism of group II intron reverse transcriptase/mature genes fragmentation provides finer differentiation of closely related 'Ca P. aurantifolia' strains and reveals higher genetic diversity than previously reported.

TI  - A Longitudinal Study of Urinary Dipstick Parameters in Wild Chimpanzees (<i>Pan troglodytes verus</i>) in Cote d'Ivoire
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY
AB  - We performed 796 dip-stick tests on urine from 100 wild West African chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) from 4 habituated groups in the tropical rain forest of Tai National Park, Cote d'Ivoire, to establish reference values for health monitoring. Specific gravity was also measured on 359 urine samples from 62 chimpanzees. The effect of age, sex, group, month, estrus, pregnancy, meat consumption, and acute respiratory disease on pH, leucocytes, protein, blood, hemoglobin, and glucose was examined using ordinal logistic regression. The presence of nitrite, ketones, bilirubin, and urobilinogen in urine was also recorded. Outbreak of acute respiratory disease did not influence any of the urinary parameters. Thirty-seven percent of the samples had a pH <7 and the whole range of pH was found through the year, in all age groups, and in both sexes. Meat consumption lowered the urinary pH. Our results show that all pH levels must be considered normal for the West African chimpanzee subspecies P. troglodytes verus living in the rainforest. We also found a cluster of glucose-positive samples at a specific point in time which was not attributed to diabetes mellitus. These findings highlight that there are differences in normal physiological parameters among wild chimpanzees living in different habitats. Am. J. Primatol. 72:689-698, 2010.

TI  - Role of microbial diversity to influence the growth and environmental remediation capacity of bamboo: A review
T2  - INDUSTRIAL CROPS AND PRODUCTS
AB  - Soil microorganisms play crucial role in maintaining the global nutrient cycle. Soil health status and its nutrient pool rely upon soil microbial community structure and function. Majority of microbes are associated symbiotically with diverse plant and animal species to maintain the growth of plants as well as their own. Soil microorganisms are highly responsible to regulate the plant metabolism and signaling by producing various metabolic compounds, which facilitate growth of plant and also provides immunity against plant diseases. Bamboo is a taxonomic group of plants which is widely distributed in many tropical and subtropical regions. The rhizospheric microbial communities of the bamboo play significant role in the immobilization of various soil nutrients and also enhances the phytoremediation and environmental restoration capability of bamboo. In this regard, the present review critically spotted light on the plant microbial interactions with major emphasis on the bamboo plantation. The diversity of bacteria and fungi in bamboo cultivated forest and how bamboo cultivation influences the microbial community's dynamic of the soil are critically discussed in the present review. Furthermore, this review cover-up various advance tools and technologies deployed in characterization of bamboo rhizospheric microbial communities. Finally, this review comprehensively explored the phytoremediation and environmental management aspects of bamboo/bamboo biomass along with prospects for the future research.

TI  - Improving multiple model ensemble predictions of daily precipitation and temperature through machine learning techniques
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Multi-Model Ensembles (MMEs) are used for improving the performance of GCM simulations. This study evaluates the performance of MMEs of precipitation, maximum temperature and minimum temperature over a tropical river basin in India developed by various techniques like arithmetic mean, Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Extra Tree Regressor (ETR), Random Forest (RF) and long short-term memory (LSTM). The 21 General Circulation Models (GCMs) from National Aeronautics Space Administration (NASA) Earth Exchange Global Daily Downscaled Projections (NEX-GDDP) dataset and 13 GCMs of Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project, Phase 6 (CMIP6) are used for this purpose. The results of the study reveal that the application of a LSTM model for ensembling performs significantly better than models in the case of precipitation with a coefficient of determination (R-2) value of 0.9. In case of temperature, all the machine learning (ML) methods showed equally good performance, with RF and LSTM performing consistently well in all the cases of temperature with R-2 value ranging from 0.82 to 0.93. Hence, based on this study RF and LSTM methods are recommended for creation of MMEs in the basin. In general, all ML approaches performed better than mean ensemble approach.

TI  - Mapping paddy rice planting area in northeastern Asia with Landsat 8 images, phenology-based algorithm and Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Area and spatial distribution information of paddy rice are important for understanding of food security, water use, greenhouse gas emission, and disease transmission. Due to climatic warming and increasing food demand, paddy rice has been expanding rapidly in high latitude areas in the last decade, particularly in northeastern (NE) Asia. Current knowledge about paddy rice fields in these cold regions is limited. The phenology- and pixel-based paddy rice mapping (PPPM) algorithm, which identifies the flooding signals in the rice transplanting phase, has been effectively applied in tropical areas, but has not been tested at large scale of cold regions yet. Despite the effects from more snow/ice, paddy rice mapping in high latitude areas is assumed to be more encouraging due to less clouds, lower cropping intensity, and more observations from Landsat sidelaps. Moreover, the enhanced temporal and geographic coverage from Landsat 8 provides an opportunity to acquire phenology information and map paddy rice. This study evaluated the potential of Landsat 8 images on annual paddy rice mapping in NE Asia which was dominated by single cropping system, including Japan, North Korea, South Korea, and NE China. The cloud computing approach was used to process all the available Landsat 8 imagery in 2014 (143 path/rows, similar to 3290 scenes) with the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The results indicated that the Landsat 8, GEE, and improved PPPM algorithm can effectively support the yearly mapping of paddy rice in NE Asia. The resultant paddy rice map has a high accuracy with the producer (user) accuracy of 73% (92%), based on the validation using very high resolution images and intensive field photos. Geographic characteristics of paddy rice distribution were analyzed from aspects of country, elevation, latitude, and climate. The resultant 30-m paddy rice map is expected to provide unprecedented details about the area, spatial distribution, and landscape pattern of paddy rice fields in NE Asia, which will contribute to food security assessment, water resource management, estimation of greenhouse gas emissions, and disease control.

TI  - Performance comparison of RGB and multispectral vegetation indices based on machine learning for estimating <i>Hopea hainanensis</i> SPAD values under different shade conditions
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
AB  - Reasonable cultivation is an important part of the protection work of endangered species. The timely and nondestructive monitoring of chlorophyll can provide a basis for the accurate management and intelligent development of cultivation. The image analysis method has been applied in the nutrient estimation of many economic crops, but information on endangered tree species is seldom reported. Moreover, shade control, as the common seedling management measure, has a significant impact on chlorophyll, but shade levels are rarely discussed in chlorophyll estimation and are used as variables to improve model accuracy. In this study, 2-year-old seedlings of tropical and endangered Hopea hainanensis were taken as the research object, and the SPAD value was used to represent the relative chlorophyll content. Based on the performance comparison of RGB and multispectral (MS) images using different algorithms, a low-cost SPAD estimation method combined with a machine learning algorithm that is adaptable to different shade conditions was proposed. The SPAD values changed significantly at different shade levels (p < 0.01), and 50% shade in the orthographic direction was conducive to chlorophyll accumulation in seedling leaves. The coefficient of determination (R-2), root mean square error (RMSE), and average absolute percent error (MAPE) were used as indicators, and the models with dummy variables or random effects of shade greatly improved the goodness of fit, allowing better adaption to monitoring under different shade conditions. Most of the RGB and MS vegetation indices (VIs) were significantly correlated with the SPAD values, but some VIs exhibited multicollinearity (variance inflation factor (VIF) > 10). Among RGB VIs, RGRI had the strongest correlation, but multiple VIs filtered by the Lasso algorithm had a stronger ability to interpret the SPAD data, and there was no multicollinearity (VIF < 10). A comparison of the use of multiple VIs to estimate SPAD indicated that Random forest (RF) had the highest fitting ability, followed by Support vector regression (SVR), linear mixed effect model (LMM), and ordinary least squares regression (OLR). In addition, the performance of MS VIs was superior to that of RGB VIs. The R-2 of the optimal model reached 0.9389 for the modeling samples and 0.8013 for the test samples. These findings reinforce the effectiveness of using VIs to estimate the SPAD value of H. hainanensis under different shade conditions based on machine learning and provide a reference for the selection of image data sources.

TI  - Eating in the Amazon: Nutritional Status of the Riverine Populations and Possible Nudge Interventions
T2  - FOODS
AB  - The Amazon is the largest tropical forest in the world and a source of healthy food, such as fruits and fish. Surprisingly, the Amazonian riverine population present an increased prevalence (as high as 58%) of non-communicable diseases, such as hypertension and insulin resistance, even higher than that described for the urban population of the Amazon. Therefore, this work aimed to analyze the nutritional status and associated risk of the riverine population. Body mass index, waist circumference (WC), waist-to-hip ratio, and neck circumference (NC) were evaluated, and risk analysis was assayed. Furthermore, data about occupation and the prevalence of consumers of the different groups of food were analyzed. All anthropometric parameters revealed high proportions of individuals at risk, WC and NC being the factors that had more high-risk women and men, respectively. Our data confirmed the characteristic profile of the riverine communities with a high number of fish consumers, but also observed different patterns probably associated to a phenomenon of nutrition transition. Based on our data, some nudge interventions that take into account the principles of behavior analysis are discussed and proposed for these populations, aiming to improve the nutritional status and avoid the long-term consequences of the results showed by this work.

TI  - Air Pollution in Northern Thailand: From "Smoky Season" to Narratives on Ecological Crisis
T2  - MOUSSONS-RECHERCHE EN SCIENCES HUMAINES SUR L ASIE DU SUD-EST
AB  - Each year, between February and April, a thick cloud of haze pollution blankets South and Southeast Asia, triggering numerous environmental, health (respiratory diseases) and political-economic problems (reduced tourist numbers, air traffic disruptions). While the physio-chemical and biophysical drivers (lack of rainfall in the dry season, temperature inversion, biomass combustion in particular) of seasonal air pollution have been extensively studied, the social and economic drivers and consequences are much less well understood. In this paper we argue that the recently dubbed, " haze crisis ", is mediated by historically situated narratives of upland - lowland, Thai - ethnic and urban - rural relations that co-constitute environmental knowledge of the causes and effects of air pollution. In this way, air pollution is as much socially as it is materially produced through, for example, customary uses of fire for forest management and agrarian transitions to plantation agriculture. Further, these long-standing social divisions drive environmental knowledge and policy in the region that often challenges rural livelihoods familiar as well as novel ways. Our article presents the first results of a research project started in autumn 2018, focusing on its contribution to the sociology of knowledge, the ethnology of Southeast Asia and the anthropology of environmental crises in tropical areas.

TI  - An Evolutionary Perspective on Food and Human Taste
T2  - CURRENT BIOLOGY
AB  - The sense of taste is stimulated when nutrients or other chemical compounds activate specialized receptor cells within the oral cavity. Taste helps us decide what to eat and influences how efficiently we digest these foods. Human taste abilities have been shaped, in large part, by the ecological niches our evolutionary ancestors occupied and by the nutrients they sought. Early hominoids sought nutrition within a closed tropical forest environment, probably eating mostly fruit and leaves, and early hominids left this environment for the savannah and greatly expanded their dietary repertoire. They would have used their sense of taste to identify nutritious food items. The risks of making poor food selections when foraging not only entail wasted energy and metabolic harm from eating foods of low nutrient and energy content, but also the harmful and potentially lethal ingestion of toxins. The learned consequences of ingested foods may subsequently guide our future food choices. The evolved taste abilities of humans are still useful for the one billion humans living with very low food security by helping them identify nutrients. But for those who have easy access to tasty, energy-dense foods our sensitivities for sugary, salty and fatty foods have also helped cause over nutrition-related diseases, such as obesity and diabetes.

TI  - A multi-centre study of the effect of Mectizan treatment on onchocercal skin disease: clinical findings
T2  - ANNALS OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND PARASITOLOGY
AB  - A multi-centre, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of the effect of Mectizan (ivermectin, MSD) treatment on the skin disease and severe itching associated with onchocerciasis was carried out in the forest zones of Nigeria, Ghana and Uganda. Overall, 4072 subjects, none of whom had received Mectizan previously, were enrolled and allocated into four groups, to receive Mectizan every 3, 6 or 12 months or placebo every 3 months. Subjects with skin lesions were stratified within each treatment group to ensure equal representation. Each subject was given a clinical examination and interviewed on enrolment and then S-monthly for 15 months. The presence and severity of itching were determined by open-ended questions followed by probing questions. Skin lesions were classified and their severity graded using a standard system. Analysis of the results was restricted to the data from the 1530 subjects who received all their scheduled treatments and attended all the follow-up visits. From 6 months onwards, all subjects who had received Mectizan reported less severe itching, had lower prevalences of reactive skin lesions and had less severe skin lesions than those in the placebo group (P < 0.05 for each). The greatest reductions, in both itching and skin disease, were seen in subjects treated with Mectizan every 6 months.
   Mectizan treatment is therefore beneficial for the control of troublesome itching and for reducing the prevalence and severity of skin disease causes by Onchocerca. It is recommended that mass distribution of Mectizan to communities in the study areas be carried out at B-monthly intervals for maximum efficacy.

TI  - Relative and absolute addressability of global disease burden in maternal and perinatal health by investment in R&D
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE & INTERNATIONAL HEALTH
AB  - Maternal and perinatal disease accounts for nearly 10% of the global burden of disease, with only modest progress towards achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. Despite a favourable new global health landscape in research and development (R&D) to produce new drugs for neglected diseases, R&D investment in maternal/perinatal health remains small and non-strategic. Investment in obstetric R&D by industry or the not-for-profit sector has lagged behind other specialties, with the number of registered pipeline drugs only 1-5% that for other major disease areas. Using a Delphi exercise with maternal/perinatal experts in global and translational research, we estimate that equitable pharmaceutical R&D and public sector research funding over the next 10-20 years could avert 1.1% and 1.9% of the global disease burden, respectively. In contrast, optimal uptake of existing research would prevent 3.0%, justifying the current focus on health service provision. Although R&D predominantly occurs in high-income countries, more than 98% of the estimated reduction in disease burden in this field would be in developing countries. We conclude that better pharmaceutical and public sector R&D would prevent around 1/3 and 2/3, respectively, of the disease burden addressable by optimal uptake of existing research. Strengthening R&D may be an important complementary strategy to health service provision to address global maternal and perinatal disease burden.

TI  - Infection coefficient of <i>Maize streak virus</i>, leafhoppers composition and control using biopesticids and some cultural practices in agro-ecological zones of Cameroon
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TROPICAL INSECT SCIENCE
AB  - Maize streak virus (MSV) is a major threat to cereal production, hence food security in sub-Saharan Africa. The virus is spread mainly by insect vectors. The leafhoppers composition and distribution of potential MSV vectors were evaluated, and the performance of various control techniques against the vectors assessed in the major maize production areas of Cameroon. These techniques included the use of botanical extracts of Azadirachta indica A Juss. and Chenopodium ambrosoides L. Mosyakin and Clements, intercropping maize with cassava and soybean, and use of the synthetic insecticides Imidacloprid. The infection coefficient of maize streak disease and the abundance of leafhoppers were assessed in three agro-ecological zones of Cameroon (AEZs) including the Sudano-Sahelian zone (AEZ I), the Western highlands (AEZ III) and the humid forest with bimodal rainfall (AEZ V). Among 15 leafhoppers species recorded, 15 were recorded in AEZ I; 14 in AEZ III and 12 in AEZ V. The most abundant species in each AEZ was Afrosteles distans (Linnavuori) while the least abundant was Aconurella erebus (Distant). Intercropping maize with cassava and maize with soybean significantly reduced the infection coefficient of MSV in the different study zones. Also, phytochemical treatments significantly performed well with neem being the most efficient in the reduction of abundance compared to the other treatments. Thus, the use of the plant extracts and intercropping against leafhopper vectors of MSV effective.

TI  - Cultural consensus knowledge of rice farmers for climate risk management in the Philippines
T2  - CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT
AB  - Despite efforts and investments to integrate weather and climate knowledges, often dichotomized into the scientific and the local, a top-down practice of science communication that tends to ignore cultural consensus knowledge still prevails. This paper presents an empirical application of cultural consensus analysis for climate risk management. It uses mixed methods such as focus groups, freelisting, pilesorting, and rapid ethnographic assessment to understand farmers' knowledge of weather and climate conditions in Barangay Biga, Oriental Mindoro, Philippines. Multi-dimensional scaling and aggregate proximity matrix of items are generated to assess the similarity among the different locally perceived weather and climate conditions. Farmers' knowledge is then qualitatively compared with the technical classification from the government's weather bureau. There is cultural agreement among farmers that the weather and climate conditions can be generally grouped into wet, dry, and unpredictable weather (Maria Loka). Damaging hazards belong into two subgroups on the opposite ends of the wet and dry scale, that is, tropical cyclone is grouped together with La Nina, rainy season, and flooding season, while farmers perceive no significant difference between El Nino, drought, and dry spells. Ethnographic information reveals that compared to the technocrats' reductive knowledge, farmers imagine weather and climate conditions (panahon) as an event or a phenomenon they are actively experiencing by observing bioindicators, making sense of the interactions between the sky and the landscape, and the agroecology of pest and diseases, while being subjected to agricultural regulations on irrigation, price volatility, and control of power on subsidies and technologies. This situated local knowledge is also being informed by forecasts and advisories from the weather bureau illustrating a hybrid of technical science, both from the technocrats and the farmers, and personal experiences amidst agricultural precarities. Speaking about the hybridity of knowledge rather than localizing the scientific obliges technocrats and scientists to productively engage with different ways of knowing and the tensions that mediate farmers' knowledge as a societal experience.

TI  - Health-promoting bioactivity and in vivo genotoxicity evaluation of a hemiepiphyte fig, <i>Ficus dubia</i>
T2  - FOOD SCIENCE & NUTRITION
AB  - Ficus species have been used as a typical component in food and folk medicine in Asia for centuries. However, little is known regarding the bioactivity and genotoxicity of the recently identified Ficus dubia (FD), an indigenous plant of the tropical evergreen rain forest. FD is unique from other Ficus species because of its highly sought-after red-brown latex. Antioxidant properties together with phenolic and flavonoid contents of FD were elucidated. Health-promoting characteristics were examined by studying the inhibition of enzymes as a drug target for diabetes, hypertension, Alzheimer's disease, and obesity, together with anticancer ability against human colorectal adenocarcinoma, human hepatocellular carcinoma, human ovarian carcinoma, human prostate adenocarcinoma, and human lung carcinoma. Besides, FD genotoxicity was tested using the Drosophila wing spot test. Results showed that both FD root and latex exhibited antioxidant activity due to the presence of phenolics and flavonoids, specifically caffeic acid and cyanidin. The ethanolic fraction of FD root demonstrated a potent antidiabetic mechanism underlying alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity similar to acarbose. This fraction also suppressed lung and ovarian cancer growth, possibly by G1 and G2/M arrest, respectively. All tested fractions lacked mutagenicity in vivo. Results indicated that FD can be developed as novel antidiabetic compounds; however, its bioactive compounds should be further identified.

TI  - Iron deficiency in children with HIV-associated anaemia: a systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the prevalence of iron deficiency in HIV-infected children from high- and low-income settings and compared it with that of HIV-uninfected controls. We searched five major databases for primary studies reporting on anaemia and iron markers in HIV-infected children. A pooled analysis was done using random-effects models, with Forest plots and heterogeneity test estimates provided. Fifteen articles (2778 children) met the inclusion criteria. In the pooled analysis, mean overall prevalence of iron deficiency in HIV-infected children was 34% (95%CI 19-50%). Prevalence rates were similar in high-income (31%; 95%CI 2-61%) and low-income settings (36%; 95%CI 17-54%) (p=0.14). Studies that included a HIV-uninfected control population (n=4) were only available from low-income settings and showed less iron deficiency in HIV-infected children (28%) than in HIV-uninfected children (43%); OR 0.50 (0.27-0.94); p=0.03. The findings suggest that HIV-infected children are less likely to be iron deficient when compared with HIV-uninfected children. Possible explanations for this include HIV-induced haematosuppression and associated hypoferraemia, with adequate iron stores. Nevertheless iron deficiency is a common co-morbidity in HIV. Studies are needed to determine the role of iron deficiency in HIV-associated anaemia and the effects of iron supplementation in this population.

TI  - Mechanisms and ecological role of carbon transfer within coastal seascapes
T2  - BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS
AB  - Worldwide, coastal systems provide some of the most productive habitats, which potentially influence a range of marine and terrestrial ecosystems through the transfer of nutrients and energy. Several reviews have examined aspects of connectivity within coastal seascapes, but the scope of those reviews has been limited to single systems or single vectors. We use the transfer of carbon to examine the processes of connectivity through multiple vectors in multiple ecosystems using four coastal seascapes as case studies. We discuss and compare the main vectors of carbon connecting different ecosystems, and then the natural and human-induced factors that influence the magnitude of effect for those vectors on recipient systems. Vectors of carbon transfer can be grouped into two main categories: detrital particulate organic carbon (POC) and its associated dissolved organic and inorganic carbon (DOC/DIC) that are transported passively; and mobile consumers that transport carbon actively. High proportions of net primary production can be exported over meters to hundreds of kilometers from seagrass beds, algal reefs and mangroves as POC, with its export dependent on wind-generated currents in the first two of these systems and tidal currents for the last. By contrast, saltmarshes export large quantities of DOC through tidal movement, while land run-off plays a critical role in the transport of terrestrial POC and DOC into temperate fjords. Nekton actively transfers carbon across ecosystem boundaries through foraging movements, ontogenetic migrations, or trophic relays', into and out of seagrass beds, mangroves or saltmarshes. The magnitude of these vectors is influenced by: the hydrodynamics and geomorphology of the region; the characteristics of the carbon vector, such as their particle size and buoyancy; and for nekton, the extent and frequency of migrations between ecosystems. Through a risk-assessment process, we have identified the most significant human disturbances that affect the integrity of connectivity among ecosystems. Loss of habitat, net primary production (NPP) and overfishing pose the greatest risks to carbon transfer in temperate saltmarsh and tropical estuaries, particularly through their effects on nekton abundance and movement. In comparison, habitat/NPP loss and climate change are likely to be the major risks to carbon transfer in temperate fjords and temperate open coasts through alteration in the amount of POC and/or DOC/DIC being transported. While we have highlighted the importance of these vectors in coastal seascapes, there is limited quantitative data on the effects of these vectors on recipient systems. It is only through quantifying those subsidies that we can effectively incorporate complex interactions into the management of the marine environment and its resources.

TI  - Community relationships of avian malaria parasites in southern missouri
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS
AB  - We studied the organization and temporal stability of an assemblage of malaria parasites (genera Plasmodium and Haemoproteus) and their passerine avian hosts in a forested study area in southern Missouri, USA, over four years. We detected parasite infections by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of parasite DNA from host blood samples and identified parasite lineages by sequencing a part of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. We obtained 757 blood samples from 42 host species. Prevalence of malaria parasitism judged by PCR averaged 38.6% and varied in parallel in the three most abundant host species over the four years of the study. Parasite prevalence bore a U-shaped relationship to host sample size. Prevalence was weakly positively associated with host body mass, but not with foraging stratum, nest height, nest type, plumage brightness, or sexual dichromatism. Over the sample as a whole, parasite prevalence did not vary between males and females or between hatch-year and older individuals.
   We differentiated 34 parasite lineages. The number of host species per lineage varied from one to eight and increased with sample size. We recovered up to 14 lineages of parasite from a single host. Three relatively common lineages in the Ozarks were found nowhere else; four others were recovered from other sites in eastern North America; and six additional well-sampled lineages were distributed in the Greater Antilles among resident island host species. Parasites that are endemic among native species of hosts on the tropical wintering grounds of Ozark birds were recovered from hatch-year birds in the Ozarks, indicating that transmission takes place on the summer breeding grounds, and consequently, that suitable vectors are present in both the temperate and tropical portions of the parasite lineage distributions.
   We estimate that the number of parasite lineages within a local area will approximate the number of host species and that our perception of host breadth and parasite diversity will increase for most lineages and hosts with increased sampling. Thus, host-parasite relationships in a local area, including the role of parasites in sexual selection and the evolutionary maintenance of sex, are likely to be complex, with population and evolutionary dynamics involving many actors.

TI  - HTLV-1 contains a high CG dinucleotide content and is susceptible to the host antiviral protein ZAP
T2  - RETROVIROLOGY
AB  - BackgroundHuman T cell leukaemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is a retrovirus associated with human diseases such as adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma and HTLV-1 associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis. In contrast to another human retrovirus, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), HTLV-1 persists in the host not via vigorous virus production but mainly via proliferation and/or long-term survival in the form of silent proviruses in infected host cells. As a result, HTLV-1-infected cells rarely produce virus particles in vivo even without anti-retroviral treatment. That should be an advantage for the virus to escape from the host immune surveillance by minimizing the expression of viral antigens in host cells. However, why HIV-1 and HTLV-1 behave so differently during natural infection is not fully understood.ResultsWe performed cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) using total RNAs and nascent, chromatin-associated, RNAs in the nucleus and found that HTLV-1 RNAs were processed post-transcriptionally in infected cells. RNA processing was evident for the sense viral transcripts but not the anti-sense ones. We also found a higher proportion of CG di-nucleotides in proviral sequences of HTLV-1-infected cells, when compared to the HIV-1 genomic sequence. It has been reported recently that CG dinucleotide content of viral sequence is associated with susceptibility to the antiviral ZC3HAV1 (ZAP), suggesting the involvement of this protein in the regulation of HTLV-1 transcripts. To analyse the effect of ZAP on HTLV-1 transcripts, we over-expressed it in HTLV-1-infected cells. We found there was a dose-dependent reduction in virus production with ZAP expression. We further knocked down endogenous ZAP with two independent targeting siRNAs and observed a significant increase in virus production in the culture supernatant. Other delta-type retroviruses such as simian T-cell leukaemia virus and bovine leukaemia virus, also contain high CG-dinucleotide contents in their viral genomes, suggesting that ZAP-mediated suppression of viral transcripts might be a common feature of delta-type retroviruses, which cause minimal viremia in their natural hosts.ConclusionsThe post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism involving ZAP might allow HTLV-1 to maintain a delicate balance required for prolonged survival in infected individuals.

TI  - <i>Phytophthora morindae</i>, a new species causing black flag disease on noni (<i>Morinda citrifolia</i> L) in Hawaii
T2  - MYCOLOGIA
AB  - A homothallic, papillate Phytophthora species causing foliar and fruit blight of noni (Morinda citrifolia var. citrifolia) in Hawaii was identified. The asexual phase of this species is characterized by the production of umbellate sporangiophores and papillate sporangia that are ellipsoid and obpyriform with conspicuously tapered bases and possess caducous, medium to long pedicels. The sexual phase is characterized by the production of oogonia with tapered bases, small amphigynous antheridia and thick-walled, plerotic oospores. The morphology of the taxon does not match any of the valid 95 Phytophthora. species described to date. Phylogenetic analysis based on sequences of the internal transcribed spacer rDNA region (ITS) and the translation elongation factor 1 alpha (EF-1 alpha) of this taxon and those from other Phytophthora species from GenBank and the Phytophthora. database indicates that the new taxon is most closely related to species in ITS clade 10, including P. kernoviae, P. boehmeriae and the recently described P. gallica. The most closely related species is R kernoviae, an invasive plant pathogen causing bleeding stem lesions on forest trees (beech, Fagus sylvatica) and foliar necrosis of ornamentals (rhododendron, pieris and magnolia) in the UK, and isolated in New Zealand from necrotic cherimoya shoots and fruits and soil. Although the morphological characters of the sexual phase of P. morindae and P. kernoviae are similar, the umbellate sporangiophores produced by the new taxon marks the main morphological distinction. In this paper we describe the morphological characteristics, the phylogenetic relationships and pathogenicity characteristics that support the description of this taxon as a new species with the proposed name Phytophthora morindae sp. nov.

TI  - FAILURE TO DETECT HUMAN T-LYMPHOTROPIC VIRUS-ANTIBODY IN WILD-CAUGHT NEW-WORLD PRIMATES
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - We conducted a study to look for a simian counterpart of human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV) in wild-caught monkeys in the Republic of Panama. Serum specimens were obtained from 102 monkeys (Ateles fusciceps, n = 75; Alouatta villosa, n = 18; and Cebus capucinus, n = 9) captured in Panama's Darien rain forest in 1979-1980. Specimens were screened for HTLV antibody by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and reactive specimens were further tested by Western blot. None of the 102 specimens were seropositive for HTLV. Our findings provide no evidence for an HTLV-like virus in New World primates from Panama, but the sample size was small, and further studies are warranted.

TI  - Improving irrigation practices in container stock plant production of herbaceous plant cuttings
T2  - INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIA ON TROPICAL AND TEMPERATE HORTICULTURE - ISTTH2016
CP  - International Symposia on Tropical and Temperate Horticulture (ISTTH)
AB  - The majority of stock plants for producing cuttings of herbaceous ornamental plants for export to the US and Europe are located in Africa and Latin America. Plants are typically produced in bags or plastic containers, often with a locally-available volcanic rock or pumice substrate, and irrigation with a nutrient solution provided through drip emitters. Nutrient solution in many farms is not captured for treatment and recirculation in order to avoid the risk of disease transmission, and leaching fractions can be as high as 80%. The objective was to evaluate alternative approaches to measure water and nutrient use efficiency, and reduce leaching of nutrient solution. Dielectric soil moisture sensors (SMS) at the University of Florida (UF) were tested in both a 90% perlite/10% coconut coir substrate and a volcanic rock substrate over two years. The SMS were calibrated to monitor and automatically control moisture level in geranium (Pelargonium x hybrida) plants. Leaching fraction was 20 to 25% in the coir substrate, however, leaching rate increased when the highly porous volcanic substrate was used. An evapotranspiration model for geranium was also calibrated using vapor pressure deficit, light, and leaf area. Data on leaf area, climate, water, and nutrient use were collected from commercial geranium stock farms in East Africa. Leaching fraction (drained irrigation volume/applied irrigation volume) averaged 65 and 40% (397 or 111 mL container(-1) day(-1)) at the commercial locations, indicating high potential to improve irrigation efficiency. In commercial stock farm locations, we concluded that climate monitoring and moisture sensors were useful tools, but that other aspects including the substrate physical properties, irrigation uniformity and infrastructure, and staff training were also important to improve watering decisions.

TI  - Patterns of association with host and habitat: Antibody reactive with Sin Nombre virus in small mammals in the major biotic communities of the southwestern United States
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - The distribution and prevalence of antibody reactive with Sin Nombre virus were determined in mammals in biotic communities of the southwestern United States. Small mammals (n = 3,069) of 69 species were trapped in nine communities from lower Sonoran desert to alpine tundra. Antibody was found in rodents from all communities (overall prevalence = 6.3%); prevalence was lowest at the altitudinal and climatic extremes (0.4% in desert and 2.0% in alpine tundra). Antibody occurred in 11% of 928 deer mice, 20% of 355 brush mice, 23% of 35 western harvest mice, and 12% of 24 Mexican voles. No infected deer mice were found in desert habitat; prevalence varied from 4% in chaparral to 17% in pinyon-juniper. Brush mice were frequently infected in chaparral and montane forest (25%). Seropositivity was higher in males and in heavier animals, suggesting horizontal transmission among adult males. Decreasing prevalence with age among the youngest deer mice suggests that infected dams confer passive immunity to pups.

TI  - West Nile virus infections are here! Are we prepared to face another flavivirus epidemic?
T2  - REVISTA DA SOCIEDADE BRASILEIRA DE MEDICINA TROPICAL
AB  - Emerging arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses), such as chikungunya and Zika viruses, are a major threat to public health in countries like Brazil where biodiversity is high and medical care is sometimes precarious. West Nile fever is a disease caused by the West Nile Virus (WNV), an RNA virus belonging to the Flaviviridae family. It is transmitted by infected mosquitoes to numerous animals like birds, reptiles and mammals, including human and non-human primates. In the last decade, the number of reported cases of WNV infection in humans and animals has increased in the Americas. Circulation of WNV in forests and rural areas in Brazil has been detected based on serological surveys and, in 2014, the first case of West Nile fever was confirmed in a patient from Piaui State. In 2018, the virus was isolated for the first time from a horse from a rural area in the state of Espirito Santo presenting with a neurological disorder; this raises the possibility that other cases of WNV encephalitis may have occurred without clinical recognition and without laboratory diagnosis by specific assays. The imminent WNV outbreak poses a challenge for Brazilian clinicians and researchers. In this review, we summarize the basic biological and ecological characteristics of this virus and the clinical presentation and treatment of febrile illnesses caused by WNV. We also discuss the epidemiological aspects, prophylaxis of WNV infections, and monitoring strategies that could be applied in the possibility of a WNV outbreak in Brazil.

TI  - An outbreak of bartonellosis in Zamora Chinchipe province in Ecuador
T2  - TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - We report an outbreak of human bartonellosis in Zamora Chinchipe Province in Ecuador, which occurred in 1995-1996. Nineteen cases were seen, of which 18 presented with classical oroya fever (fever and profound anaemia) and one with verruga peruana; 11 of the cases (58%) had positive blood films containing Bartonella bacilliformis. The houses of cases and neighbouring controls were visited; blood samples for thin films and cultures were collected from members of each house and a questionnaire was administered to investigate possible risk factors for disease transmission. In none of those sampled was B. bacilliformis bacteriologically demonstrable. All case houses were located in isolated areas at the margin of forest and the presence of dead rodents was reported only in case houses (P<0.05). We suggest that human bartonellosis is a zoonosis with a natural rodent reservoir and that migrant humans infected in this way may become a temporary reservoir host in populated areas.

TI  - Adaptation of vegetation in high-rate constructed wetland using artificial carriers for bacterial growth: Assessment using phytopathological indicators
T2  - JOURNAL OF WATER PROCESS ENGINEERING
AB  - A variant of constructed wetland using artificial carriers for bacterial growth as support medium (High Rate Constructed Wetlands (HRCW)) has been developed to depurate high organic loads (45 g BOD5 m(-2) d(-1)). The metabolic state of vegetation in this phytodepuration system affects the treatment processes; therefore, its optimum adaptation is necessary. A comparative study, in mesocosms scale, was undertaken to test the capacity of adaptation of three plant species (Cyperus alternifolius, Heliconia burleana, and Zantedeschia aethiopica) in HRCW. 25 units of each species were planted in three lines of HRCW (one species per line), named for ease of understanding as L1, L2, L3 respectively, and monitored during the start-up phase of the system under climatic conditions of intersection between dry tropical forest and premontane sub-humid. Quantitative epidemiology was used to determine incidence, infection rate, and the relative area under the disease progress curve for each type of plant. The relationship between these epidemiology variables and the environmental conditions was determined. Vegetative stress was observed in all species, followed by a phase of high phytopathology, with infection rates of 0.0049-0.0183; 0.1085-0.1821; 0.0911-0.1158 (units/day) for L1, L2, and L3, respectively. The combination between the high organic load, water volume (94% v/v), and weather conditions favoured this behaviour. This study indicated that Cyperus alternifolius is a type of plant suitable for HRCW; highlighted the importance of studies on plant adaptation in CW with particular conditions; and showed epidemiological analysis as a tool for performing this selection in a low cost and user-friendly way.

TI  - Chikungunya Virus: Emerging Targets and New Opportunities for Medicinal Chemistry
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY
AB  - Chikungunya virus is an emerging arbovirus that is widespread in tropical regions and is spreading quickly to temperate climates with recent epidemics in Africa and Asia and documented outbreaks in Europe and the Americas. It is having an increasingly major impact on humankind, with potentially life-threatening and debilitating arthritis. There is no treatment available, and only in the past 24 months have lead compounds for development as potential therapeutics been reported. This Perspective discusses the chikungunya virus as a significant, new emerging topic for medicinal chemistry, highlighting the key viral target proteins and their molecular functions that can be used in drug design, as well as the most important ongoing developments for anti-chikungunya virus research. It represents a complete picture of the current medicinal chemistry of chikungunya, supporting the development of chemotherapeutics through drug discovery and design targeting this virus.

TI  - Structure based design towards the identification of novel binding sites and inhibitors for the chikungunya virus envelope proteins
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR GRAPHICS & MODELLING
AB  - Chikungunya virus is an emerging arbovirus that is widespread in tropical regions and is spreading quickly to temperate climates with recent epidemics in Africa, Asia, Europe and the Americas. It is having an increasingly major impact on humans with potentially life-threatening and debilitating arthritis. Thus far, neither vaccines nor medications are available to treat or control the virus and therefore, the development of medicinal chemistry is a vital and immediate issue that needs to be addressed. The viral envelope proteins play a major role during infection through mediation of binding and fusion with the infected cell surfaces. The possible binding target sites of the chikungunya virus envelope proteins have not previously been investigated; we describe here for the first time the identification of novel sites for potential binding on the chikungunya glycoprotein complexes and the identification of possible antagonists for these sites through virtual screening using two successive docking scores; FRED docking for fast precise screening, with the top hits then subjected to a ranking scoring using the AUTODOCK algorithm. Both the immature and the mature forms of the chikungunya envelope proteins were included in the study to increase the probability of finding positive and reliable hits. Some small molecules have been identified as good in silica chikungunya virus envelope proteins inhibitors and these could be good templates for drug design targeting this virus.

TI  - Breeding season shift by the Oahu Elepaio (<i>Chasiempis ibidis</i>) in response to changing rainfall patterns
T2  - WILSON JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY
AB  - Anthropogenic climate change is affecting many bird species in a variety of ways, causing changes in their distribution, abundance, and food supply, and triggering responses such as shifting migration and nesting seasons. Most studies have focused on migratory birds that breed in temperate areas and little is known about effects of climate change on tropical birds. We used a 24 year dataset that included 1,632 nesting events of the Oahu Elepaio (Chasiempis ibidis), an endangered forest bird endemic to Hawaii, to investigate whether breeding phenology and performance were related to rainfall and whether a recent shift in the breeding season is related to changes in rainfall. Fecundity of the Oahu Elepaio was closely related to rainfall, with more offspring produced during years with higher rainfall. During the first 19 years of this study, from 1996 to 2014, all nests were initiated from November to June. From 2015 to 2019, up to 33% of annual reproduction occurred from August to October. Higher rainfall caused parallel increases in reproduction during the normal nesting season and the atypical season, with some birds nesting in both seasons. The change in breeding phenology of the Oahu Elepaio is unusual because it was not a gradual transition, but a sudden change of 6 months. The shift in breeding phenology coincided with unusually high summer and fall rainfall from tropical storms associated with a novel climate pattern in the northern Pacific Ocean from late 2014-2016 termed the warm blob. This pattern of warmer water and more frequent storms is expected to become more prevalent in the Central Pacific, so summer-fall breeding in the Oahu Elepaio is likely to continue and perhaps become more common. The Oahu Elepaio is flexible, adaptable, and may not be seriously affected by changing climatic conditions. Received 28 June 2020. Accepted 16 March 2021.

TI  - Malaria in Southern Venezuela: The hottest hotspot in Latin America
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Author summary
   Despite major progress in malaria control or elimination in South America in the last years, this disease is still an important public health concern in all the Amazon basin countries, particularly during 2017 and 2018, when a substantial malaria incidence (similar to one million) was reported. Most of the rise in cases has been due to increases in malaria transmission in Venezuela. Within this country, populations in the southeastern (Guiana Shield) region have been at the highest risk of Plasmodium vivax and P. falciparum infection. In this study, reported malaria cases between 2007-2017 in this region were analyzed to stratify the spatial risk of disease and identify the malaria surge's main driver over the last years. Malaria risk was highly focal and prevalent in 2 consistent disease hotspots that accounted for most Plasmodium transmission in the whole region. Illegal gold-mining activities seem to drive malaria in these disease pockets and seem critical in malaria's surge throughout the country. Analyses of the Venezuelan surveillance data showed that from 2014 onwards, local malaria transmission has reemerged in new areas of the country, leading to a shift in this disease's epidemiology. Successful control of Venezuela's ongoing malaria epidemic requires hotspot-targeted control at the national level and regional coordination to avoid cross-border malaria spillover.
   Malaria elimination in Latin America is becoming an elusive goal. Malaria cases reached a historical similar to 1 million in 2017 and 2018, with Venezuela contributing 53% and 51% of those cases, respectively. Historically, malaria incidence in southern Venezuela has accounted for most of the country's total number of cases. The efficient deployment of disease prevention measures and prediction of disease spread to new regions requires an in-depth understanding of spatial heterogeneity on malaria transmission dynamics. Herein, we characterized the spatial epidemiology of malaria in southern Venezuela from 2007 through 2017 and described the extent to which malaria distribution has changed country-wide over the recent years. We found that disease transmission was focal and more prevalent in the southeast region of southern Venezuela where two persistent hotspots of Plasmodium vivax (76%) and P. falciparum (18%) accounted for similar to 60% of the total number of cases. Such hotspots are linked to deforestation as a consequence of illegal gold mining activities. Incidence has increased nearly tenfold over the last decade, showing an explosive epidemic growth due to a significant lack of disease control programs. Our findings highlight the importance of spatially oriented interventions to contain the ongoing malaria epidemic in Venezuela. This work also provides baseline epidemiological data to assess cross-border malaria dynamics and advocates for innovative control efforts in the Latin American region.

TI  - White-lipped peccaries are recorded at Iguacu National Park after 20 years
T2  - MAMMALIA
AB  - The white-lipped peccary (WLP) is the most endangered ungulate in the Neotropics. In the recent years, this species has undergone a large reduction in range size and experienced the loss of several populations. An emblematic case was the local extinction of this species from the Iguacu National Park (INP) in the mid-1990s. After the report of this particular WLP disappearance, surveys conducted along the 2000s confirmed its absence in the park. However, in 2016, after 20 years of previous reports, we obtained five records of WLP herds, indicating a possible population recovery probably resulting from emigration. To effectively re-establish white-lipped peccary population and, consequently, restore its ecological role, urgent practical conservation measures are necessary.

TI  - Mammalian herbivores in Australia transport nutrients from terrestrial to marine ecosystems via mangroves
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY
AB  - Nutrient subsidies from one ecosystem to another serve a critical link among ecosystems. The transfer of materials across the terrestrial-to-marine boundary is considered to be driven by hydrological connectivity, but animal movement can provide another pathway for nutrient transfers. In two separate studies we assessed the role mammals (bats and kangaroos) play in alleviating nutrient limitation in mangrove forests in Australia. At Lizard Island, we measured tree growth and foliar elemental and isotopic composition of trees growing within and outside a large flying fox roost. In Western Australia, we measured foliar elemental and isotopic composition of trees within two forests frequented by kangaroos that feed in spinifex grasslands and shelter in the shade of the mangroves. We compared those with mangroves from adjacent forests that are not frequented by kangaroos. We show that at both locations, the mangroveforest receives terrestrial nutrient subsidies through animal movement. At Lizard Island dominant mangrove species were significantly enriched in nitrogen within the bat roost, as evidenced by higher foliar N concentrations (by up to 150%), N:P and N:C ratios in trees within the roost compared with trees outside the roost. The isotopic signature of foliar N was significantly enriched in 15N by 1-3% within the roost, further suggesting that the source of the N enrichment was the bat roost. Growth rates of mangroves within the roost were nearly six times higher than trees outside the roost. In the arid coast of Western Australia, we show elevated foliar N-15 abundance of up to 3 parts per thousand in mangroves where kangaroos shelter relative to trees where they do not. Thus, this study presents two examples for mammalian herbivore mediated localized transport of nutrients from terrestrial to marine ecosystems, consequently affecting mangrove tree growth, productivity and forest structure.

TI  - The Burden of <i>Pneumocystis</i> Pneumonia Infection among HIV Patients in Ethiopia: A Systematic Review
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE
AB  - Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) is a leading cause of death among patients with AIDS worldwide, but its burden is difficult to estimate in low- and middle-income countries, including Ethiopia. This systematic review aimed to estimate the pooled prevalence of PCP in Ethiopia, the second most densely populated African country. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines were used to review published and unpublished studies conducted in Ethiopia. Studies that reported on the prevalence of PCP among HIV-infected patients were searched systematically. Variations between the studies were assessed by using forest plot and I-squared heterogeneity tests. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were carried out when I2 > 50. The pooled estimate prevalence with 95% CI was computed using a random-effects model of analysis. Thirteen articles, comprising studies of 4847 individuals living with HIV, were included for analysis. The pooled prevalence of PCP was 5.65% (95% CI [3.74-7.56]) with high heterogeneity (I2 = 93.6%, p < 0.01). To identify the source of heterogeneity, subgroup analyses were conducted by study design, geographical region, diagnosis methods, and year of publication. PCP prevalence differed significantly when biological diagnostic methods were used (32.25%), in studies published before 2010 (32.51%), in cross-sectional studies (8.08%), and in Addis Ababa (14.05%). PCP prevalence differences of 3.25%, 3.07%, 3.23%, and 2.29% were recorded in studies based on clinical records, published since 2017, follow-up studies, and north-west Ethiopian studies, respectively. The prevalence of PCP is probably underestimated, as the reports were mainly based on clinical records. An expansion of biological diagnostic methods could make it possible to estimate the exact burden of PCP in Ethiopia.

TI  - A Novel Hybrid Swarm Optimized Multilayer Neural Network for Spatial Prediction of Flash Floods in Tropical Areas Using Sentinel-1 SAR Imagery and Geospatial Data
T2  - SENSORS
AB  - Flash floods are widely recognized as one of the most devastating natural hazards in the world, therefore prediction of flash flood-prone areas is crucial for public safety and emergency management. This research proposes a new methodology for spatial prediction of flash floods based on Sentinel-1 SAR imagery and a new hybrid machine learning technique. The SAR imagery is used to detect flash flood inundation areas, whereas the new machine learning technique, which is a hybrid of the firefly algorithm (FA), Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) backpropagation, and an artificial neural network (named as FA-LM-ANN), was used to construct the prediction model. The Bac Ha Bao Yen (BHBY) area in the northwestern region of Vietnam was used as a case study. Accordingly, a Geographical Information System (GIS) database was constructed using 12 input variables (elevation, slope, aspect, curvature, topographic wetness index, stream power index, toposhade, stream density, rainfall, normalized difference vegetation index, soil type, and lithology) and subsequently the output of flood inundation areas was mapped. Using the database and FA-LM-ANN, the flash flood model was trained and verified. The model performance was validated via various performance metrics including the classification accuracy rate, the area under the curve, precision, and recall. Then, the flash flood model that produced the highest performance was compared with benchmarks, indicating that the combination of FA and LM backpropagation is proven to be very effective and the proposed FA-LM-ANN is a new and useful tool for predicting flash flood susceptibility.

TI  - Behavioral heterogeneity of <i>Anopheles darlingi</i> (Diptera: Culicidae) and malaria transmission dynamics along the Maroni River, Suriname, French Guiana
T2  - TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - The border area between Suriname and French Guiana is considered the most affected malaria area in South America. A one-year cooperative malaria vector study was performed by the two countries, between March 2004 and February 2005, in four villages. Anopheles darlingi proved to be the most abundant anopheline species. Human biting rates differed between villages. The differential effect of high rainfall on mosquito densities in the villages suggests variation in breeding sites. Overall parity rates were low, with means varying from 0.31 to 0.56 per study site. Of the 2045 A. darlingi mosquitoes collected, 13 were found to be infected with Plasmodium: ten P. falciparum, two P. malariae and one mixed P. malariae/P. vivax. The overall annual entomological inoculation rates in the villages ranged from 8.7 to 66.4. There was an apparent lack of relationship between number of malaria cases and periods of high mosquito density. The tendency of Anopheles darlingi to bite during sleeping hours provides opportunity for malaria control using impregnated bed nets, a strategy just introduced in Suriname that may also find its way into French Guiana.

TI  - Temperature dependent transmission potential model for chikungunya in India
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - The risk of chikungunya transmission in recent years of climate is gradually increasing in India. The R-0 predicts the optimal temperature for peak chikungunya transmission is 29 degrees C and declined to zero below <17 degrees C and above >34 degrees C. Similarly the predicted temperatures are better suited for Aedes vectors development and diseases transmission.
   [GRAPHICS]
   Chikungunya is a major public health problem in tropical and subtropical countries of the world. During 2016, the National Capital Territory of Delhi experienced an epidemic caused by chikungunya virus with >12,000 cases. Similarly, other parts of India also reported a large number of chikungunya cases, highest incidence rate was observed during 2016 in comparison with last 10 years of epidemiological data. In the present study we exploited R-0 mathematical model to understand the transmission risk of chikungunya virus which is transmitted by Aedes vectors. This mechanistic transmission model is climate driven and it predicts how the probability and transmission risk of chikungunya occurs in India. The gridded temperature data from 1948 to 2016 shows that the mean temperatures are gradually increasing in South India from 1982 to 2016 when compared with data of 1948-1981 time scale. During 1982-2016 period many states have reported gradual increase in risk of chikungunya transmission when compared with the 1948-1981 period. The highest transmission risk of chikungunya in India due to favourable ecoclimatic conditions, increasing temperature leads to low extrinsic incubation period, mortality rates and high biting rate were predicted for the year 2016. The epidemics in 2010 and 2016 are also strongly connected to El Nino conditions which favours transmission of chikungunya in India. The study shows that transmission of chikungunya occurs between 20 and 34 degrees C but the peak transmission occurs at 29 degrees C. The infections of chikungunya in India are due to availability of vectors and optimum temperature conditions influence chikungunya transmission faster in India. This climate based empirical model helps the public health authorities to assess the risk of chikungunya and one can implement necessary control measures before onset of disease outbreak.

TI  - Development and Evaluation of Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) as a Preliminary Diagnostic Tool for Brown Root Rot Disease Caused by <i>Phellinus noxius</i> (Corner) G. H. Cunningham in Hong Kong Urban Tree Management
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Brown Root Rot Disease (BRRD) is one of the most devastating urban tree diseases in tropical and subtropical areas, including Hong Kong. It can result in tree death in a few months and is difficult to detect in the early stages of development. Fungal isolation and PCR methods are currently the most widely adopted methods to diagnose the disease. However, they are both time and technically demanding. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a superior molecular-based diagnostic method with great specificity, accessibility, and effectivity. In this study, 15 BRRD-positive and 15 BRRD-negative trees were sampled from 19 roadside slopes in Hong Kong from the end of 2020 to the middle of 2021. The wood tissues were isolated and cultivated in PN3 and PDA agars for the disease diagnosis. The mycelium samples in PDA were directly conducted in LAMP kits (mLAMP) to substitute the purified DNA materials. Wood tissues were also used in LAMP kits (wLAMP) as impurified and highly contaminated samples. The results of mLAMP and wLAMP were compared with the results of isolation to evaluate the specificity and sensitivity of LAMP method. The results showed that mLAMP had 100% sensitivity and 73.3% specificity. For wLAMP, both the sensitivity and specificity were 73.3%. For symptomless trees, 85.7% and 64.3% congruencies were found in mLAMP and wLAMP, respectively. Based on the results of this study, the co-application of LAMP in the current tree management work was also discussed. We envisaged LAMP is a sensitive, prompt, and user-friendly method to diagnose BRRD and it could favor the BRRD diagnosis in fields by accelerating and promoting large-scale screening.

TI  - Potential dispersal of aquatic snails by waterbird endozoochory in neotropical wetlands
T2  - BIOTA NEOTROPICA
AB  - Waterbird-mediated zoochory is one of the main ecological mechanisms by which non-flying freshwater invertebrates can disperse between isolated wetlands. Passive dispersal through gut passage inside waterbirds (endozoochory) may explain how many organisms spread in the landscape. Here, we evaluate the potential for dispersal of aquatic snails by three waterbird species in neotropical wetlands. A total of 77 faecal samples from Coscoroba coscoroba (n = 28), Dendrocygna viduata (n = 36) and Anas flavirostris (n = 13) were collected in the field and taken to the laboratory. There, the samples were examined under a stereomicroscope to check for the presence of gastropod shells. We found 496 intact gastropod shells, and Heleobia piscium was the most abundant species (n = 485). We also found two shells of Drepanotrema sp. and nine others distributed between two different morphotypes of Planorbidae. Snails were present in 20.8 % of all samples, and were more frequent in faeces of coscoroba swan (50%) than the other two bird species. Our data suggest that aquatic snails may disperse by avian endozoochory between neotropical wetlands, with vectors including migratory bird species.

TI  - Visceral leishmaniasis:: a study on phlebotomine sand flies and canine infection in Montes Claros, State of Minas Gerais
T2  - REVISTA DA SOCIEDADE BRASILEIRA DE MEDICINA TROPICAL
AB  - Visceral leishmaniasis in Brazil was initially associated with rural areas. However, due to several environmental modi cations such as deforestation, urbanization and intense migratory processes, there has been an expansion of endemic areas, leading to urbanization of the disease, mainly in the central and northeastern regions of Brazil. In the municipality of Montes Claros, located in the north of the state of Minas Gerais, an epidemiological survey on VL was carried out. A canine serological inquiry was carried out in 2002 and an entomological survey, using luminous CDC traps, was performed from September 2002 to August 2003. Canine VL prevalence showed an average infection rate of approximately 5 %. An estimated 16 species comprised the phlebotomine sand fly fauna, based on a total of 1043 specimens. The predominant species was Lutzomyia longipalpis with a rate of 74 %, suggesting its participation in the transmission of VL in the municipality of Montes Claros.

TI  - Characterization of genes expressed in <i>Casuarina equisetifolia</i> in response to elicitation by cell wall components of <i>Trichosporium vesiculosum</i>
T2  - SILVAE GENETICA
AB  - Casuarina equisetifolia has the widest distribution of all Casuarina species and is a nitrogen-fixing tree planted in tropical/subtropical littoral zones of Asia, the Pacific and Africa for coastal reclamation, charcoal making, pulp and timber. Trichosporium vesiculosum, the causal agent of blister bark disease, is a serious pathogen of C. equisetifolia. The present study was undertaken to understand the molecular mechanisms involved during pathogen cell wall elicitation in this hardy tree species. Transcript profiling during elicitation induced by cell wall components of T. vesiculosum revealed expression of resistance genes; cytochrome oxidase; trans membrane proteins; genes involved in programmed cell death like 26S proteasome and ubiquitin activating enzyme; early nodulin gene, wound inducible metallocarboxy peptidase inhibitor, glucanase, metal binding protein and signal recognition particle. The fold expression of selected transcripts including glucanase, 26 S proteasome, signal recognition particle, cytochrome oxidase and the metal binding protein using RT-qPCR revealed 12-59 fold increase in expression after 48 hours of elicitor treatment. The expression of these transcripts during abiotic stresses like heat, mechanical wounding, salt (NaCl) and drought (PEG) was also analyzed. Glucanase was up-regulated significantly during wounding and heat stress while proteasome was up-regulated 1-4 fold during NaCl, PEG and wounding stress. The novel transcript CeHMA was up-regulated under all the stress conditions.
   This is the first report on molecular defense in C. equisetifolia and has provided a pool of candidate genes for detailed molecular dissection to further broaden the knowledge on the response of woody perennials during pathogen cell wall elicitation.

TI  - Reproductive phenology of bromeliad species at Serra da Piedade, Minas Gerais State, Brazil
T2  - ACTA BOTANICA BRASILICA
AB  - (Reproductive phenology of bromeliad species at Serra da Piedade, Minas Gerais State, Brazil). This work characterizes the phenology of Bromeliaceae species at Serra da Piedade. Of the i8 species studied, 72% flowered in the rainy season and 28% in the dry season. We observed sequential flowering of bromeliads along the entire altitudinal gradient at Serra da Piedade; flowering was also influenced by rainfall seasonality. Most species that occur in the rocky xeric habitat (above 1400 m altitude) flowered during the rainy season, while three of the five species found in the mesic forest (below 1300 m altitude) flowered in the dry season. Sympatric species with similar floral characteristics, such as Tillandsia stricta, T. gardneri, Vriesea citrina and V. crassa, also flowered sequentially. The dispersal of species with winged seeds (Pitcairnoideae) and plumose seeds (Tillandsioideae) occurred in the dry season, except for Dyckia saxatilis and Racinaea aerisincola. Asynchrony was observed in fruit maturation and seed dispersal among zoochorous bromeliads. These conditions probably allow the bromeliad species of Serra da Piedade to avoid use overlap of animal vectors of pollen and seeds.

TI  - Pollination of <i>Pagamea duckei</i> Standl. (Rubiaceae): a functionally dioecious species
T2  - BIOTA NEOTROPICA
AB  - The floral biology, pollination and breeding system of Pagamea duckei Standl. (Rubiaceae) were studied at the Reserva Biologica da Campina, Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil. Floral morphology suggested that P. duckei is a distylous species. However, crossing experiments revealed that it is functionally dioecious. The flowers are actinomorphic, yellowish, produce nectar and a sweet odor, which is more intense in the morning. Anthesis started in the morning between 5.00 and 6.00 AM and extended until dusk, when the corolla tube abscissed. The flowers were visited mostly by bees of the genus Melipona. Pagamea duckei is not agamospermic and thus needs pollen vectors for effective pollination. The results of this study strengthen the idea that, in Pagamea, species with distylous flower morphology are actually functionally dioecious.

T2  - 2009 IEEE INTERNATIONAL GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING SYMPOSIUM, VOLS 1-5
CP  - IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium
AB  - This work demonstrates the utility of reduced resolution ALOS Palsar data for biomass mapping and land cover classification over the tropical forests of Indonesia. This study is important because we processed the ALOS Palsar mosaic, which is made freely available within K&C initiatives project and will be updated regularly We first used 38 sample plots collected on the ground during dry season in September 2004, to develop a tree diameter (dbh) - biomass model. The HH, HV, HV/HH and HH-HV backscatters of ALOS Palsar data allowed the empirical estimation of forest above ground biomass (AGB). Each band of Palsar data was separately used to estimate the biomass, and we found HV band resulted in better correlation with the AGB compared to other SAR bands. Validation of the prediction results was carried out by comparing the biomass estimates with those predicted from an existing allometric equation.
   Optical data are sensitive to the physical properties of the reflectors whereas SAR data are more influenced by the geometric properties of the scatterers Therefore, the second part of this study concerned the integration of mosaic SAR textures and ETM data for land cover classification. The classification was conducted using ETM data and variations of ETM, SAR bands, and SAR textures calculated using GLC Matrix. The image classifications were carried out using a Machine Learning based classifier, so-called Support Vector Machine (SVM), and a conventional Maximum Likelihood method. An ensemble of neural networks method using Kalman Filter and scaled conjugate gradient algorithm was applied. The classification accuracy was assessed using confusion matrices and Kappa Statistics We show that the Introduction of SAR textures significantly enhanced the classification accuracies.
   This study showed that the joint processing of SAR and multispectral data increased the accuracies of biomass estimation and landuse classifications. The efficiency of the method at medium spatial resolutions allows its application of global datasets.

TI  - Variability and geographical distribution of <i>Fusarium oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>lycopersici</i> physiological races and field performance of resistant sources in Brazil
T2  - V INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON TOMATO DISEASES: PERSPECTIVES AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS IN TOMATO PROTECTION
CP  - 5th International Symposium on Tomato Diseases - Perspectives and Future Directions in Tomato Protection
AB  - Fusarium wilt, caused by three physiological races of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici (FOL), is a major tomato disease in tropical and subtropical regions of Brazil. A collection of FOL isolates from Brazil was characterized via inoculation assays using a set of Solanum (sect. Lycopersicon) accessions employed for race discrimination: 'Ponderosa' (susceptible to all races), 'IPA-5' (race 1 resistant due to the I locus); 'Floradade' (races 1 and 2 resistant; I-2 gene), Solanum pennellii 'LA 716' (resistant to race 3; I-3 gene) and 'BHRS 2-3' (race 3 resistant; I-7 gene introgressed from S. pennellii 'PI 414773'). Race-specific molecular marker systems were also employed in these studies. Surveys indicated that races 1 and 2 are widespread in Brazil. However, because of the massive use of hybrids with both I and I-2 genes, no new isolates of these two races have been incorporated into the Brazilian FOL collection since 2002. Race 3 isolates were initially restricted to commercial fields located in mild climate areas encompassing the Atlantic Forest biome in Espirito Santo and Rio de Janeiro states (southeast region). However, recent surveys indicated that FOL race 3 isolates were also present in the states of Minas Gerais (in the continental southeastern region) and Bahia (northeastern region), thus expanding the geographical distribution of this pathogen. The fast and widespread dissemination of race 3 in Brazil suggests its introduction into new producing areas via contaminated propagative material. The severe outbreaks of race 3 were the basis for the substantial replacement of susceptible hybrids by resistant ones (mainly with the I-3 gene). 'BRS Imigrante' (released by Embrapa) was the first commercial hybrid with the I-7 gene. 'BRS Imigrante' and the I-3 gene-carrying hybrids show high levels of resistance in distinct production regions even when the tomato crop is established in heavily infested soils. Multi-race-resistant hybrids are now prevalent in all FOL-infested areas, increasing the selection pressure in favor of new FOL variants.

TI  - Patterns of mosquito and arbovirus community composition and ecological indexes of arboviral risk in the northeast United States
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   In the northeast United States (U.S.), mosquitoes transmit a number of arboviruses, including eastern equine encephalitis, Jamestown Canyon, and West Nile that pose an annual threat to human and animal health. Local transmission of each arbovirus may be driven by the involvement of multiple mosquito species; however, the specificity of these vector-virus associations has not been fully quantified.
   Methodology
   We used long-term surveillance data consistently collected over 18 years to evaluate mosquito and arbovirus community composition in the State of Connecticut (CT) based on land cover classifications and mosquito species-specific natural histories using community ecology approaches available in the R package VEGAN. We then used binomial-error generalized linear mixed effects models to quantify species-specific trends in arbovirus detections.
   Primary results
   The composition of mosquito communities throughout CT varied more among sites than among years, with variation in mosquito community composition among sites explained mostly by a forested-to-developed-land-cover gradient. Arboviral communities varied equally among sites and years, and only developed and forested wetland land cover classifications were associated with the composition of arbovirus detections among sites. Overall, the avian host arboviruses, mainly West Nile and eastern equine encephalitis, displayed the most specific associations among mosquito species and sites, while in contrast, the mammalian host arboviruses (including Cache Valley, Jamestown Canyon, and Potosi) associated with a more diverse mix of mosquito species and were widely distributed throughout CT.
   Conclusions
   We find that avian arboviruses act as vector specialists infecting a few key mosquito species that associate with discrete habitats, while mammalian arboviruses are largely vector generalists infecting a wide diversity of mosquito species and habitats in the region. These distinctions have important implications for the design and implementation of mosquito and arbovirus surveillance programs as well as mosquito control efforts.
   Author summary
   The numbers and types of mosquito species in a community vary across space and time, and this variability may be linked to variation in risk of human exposure to mosquito-borne diseases. In this report, the authors use a long-term mosquito-borne virus (i.e., arbovirus) surveillance dataset from the State of Connecticut (CT), United States to first examine whether or not the same land cover classes explain variation in mosquito and arbovirus community composition; they then used statistical models to determine which mosquito species were the most likely and unlikely to test positive for an infection for one of seven arboviruses circulating in CT. Multiple mosquito species tested positive for each arbovirus examined, and blood feeding behaviors were the strongest predictor of whether or not a mosquito species tested positive for a particular arbovirus. Isolations of bird-host arboviruses aggregated in discrete habitat types, while isolations of mammalian-host arboviruses showed no specific habitat associations. The authors conclude that risk of bird-host arbovirus exposures in humans is driven by only a few key mosquito species, whereas risk of mammalian-host arbovirus exposure in humans could be attributed to the general presence and abundance of mammal-feeding mosquito species in the community.

TI  - Ignoring the "Itch": The Global Health Problem of Scabies
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Infestation with Sarcoptes scabiei var. hominis is a common human parasitic affliction endemic in tropical developing countries. Scabies is transmitted by close person-person contact, and outbreaks have been reported in reception centers for asylum seekers. Scabies presents clinically as extremely pruritic excoriated papules and linear burrows in the skin. This infestation predisposes to bacterial skin infections that can result in serious complications affecting the kidneys and possibly the heart. Treatment of individuals with scabies and their close contacts involves the use of antiparasitic agents. First-line treatment is topical 5% permethrin cream. Community mass drug administration, followed by active case finding with targeted treatment, is a promising approach that can reduce the prevalence of both scabies and bacterial skin infections. Organizations such as the International Alliance for the Control of Scabies are advocating for the development of integrated disease control strategies in an effort to decrease scabies infestation worldwide.

TI  - Pining away and at home: global utilisation of<i> Pinus</i><i> radiata</i> by native and non-native insects
T2  - NEOBIOTA
AB  - Pinus radiata (radiata pine or Monterey pine) is threatened in its native range in California and, at the same time, one of the most widely-planted tree species worldwide, especially in the southern hemisphere. It is affected by a wide range of plant-feeding insects both in its native range and in regions where it is planted as an introduced tree. In addition, there are many invasive insects that have colonised P. radiata, in some cases causing major damage. Here, our objectives were to provide a complete and up-to-date over-view of all insect species recorded from P. radiata worldwide, to summarise where these insects are native and which countries or regions they have invaded, to categorise them according to their impacts as dam-aging species or as vectors of plant pathogens, and to examine border interceptions to determine whether pathways exist that would allow these species to enter and potentially invade additional regions. Our com-pilation of insects feeding on P. radiata provides a list of 649 species (and an additional 11 species identi-fied at the genus level only). Coleoptera is the most represented order in the list (299 species), followed by Lepidoptera (224 species) and Hemiptera (65 species). We classified 28 species as high-impact, including 12 true bark beetles (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae), eight Lepidoptera, five other Coleoptera, two Hymenoptera and one Hemiptera. These species can cause substantial direct damage or act as vectors of highly-damaging plant pathogens. Other species cause only occasional damage, rarely requiring man-agement (classified as 'low-medium impact') or they are generally benign ('negligible impact'). Hemiptera and Scolytinae have a high proportion of species established outside their native range. The Nearctic and Neotropic regions have been invaded by the most high-impact species, mainly by species native to Europe. Border interceptions of 185 species (29% of those on our list) were recorded during import inspections between 1995-2021, indicating considerable potential for further invasions. The findings of our study can be used to identify potential high-impact invaders and the pathways that may require more phytosanitary attention. Furthermore, our analyses provide useful insights into the insect-plant interactions resulting from the global distribution of a tree species and the native and non-native insects feeding on it.

TI  - Pathogenic Botryosphaeriaceae associated with <i>Mangifera indica</i> in the Kimberley Region of Western Australia
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PATHOLOGY
AB  - Members of the Botryosphaeriaceae, in particular Lasiodiplodia theobromae, Neofusicoccum parvum, N. mangiferum and Botryosphaeria dothidea, commonly cause stem cankers, dieback and stem end rot of mangoes worldwide. In the current study, eight taxa of Botryosphaeriaceae were identified as canker-associated fungi, pathogens, potential pathogens or endophytes of mangoes in the Kimberley, Australia. These include Neoscytalidium novaehollandiae, Ne. dimidiatum, Pseudofusicoccum adansoniae, P. ardesiacum, P. kimberleyense, Lasiodiplodia sp. 1, L. iraniensis and L. pseudotheobromae. The pathogenicity of a selection of these species toward fruit and branches was tested. All were pathogenic to mango in comparison to the control, with Lasiodiplodia spp. being the most pathogenic. It appears that either geographic isolation or the unique growing conditions in the Kimberley may have provided an effective barrier to the acquisition or establishment of known botryosphaeriaceous pathogens. Wounds caused by mechanical pruning may provide an entry point for infection, whilst severe pruning may increase plant stress.

TI  - Hyperspectral band selection and Classification of Hyperion image of Bhitarkanika mangrove ecosystem, eastern India
T2  - REMOTE SENSING FOR AGRICULTURE, ECOSYSTEMS, AND HYDROLOGY XVI
CP  - Conference on Remote Sensing for Agriculture, Ecosystems, and Hydrology XVI was part of the International Symposium on Remote Sensing
AB  - Tropical mangrove forests along the coast evolve dynamically due to constant changes in the natural ecosystem and ecological cycle. Remote sensing has paved the way for periodic monitoring and conservation of such floristic resources, compared to labour intensive in-situ observations. With the laboratory quality image spectra obtained from hyperspectral image data, species level discrimination in habitats and ecosystems is attainable. One of the essential steps before classification of hyperspectral image data is band selection. It is important to eliminate the redundant bands to mitigate the problems of Hughes effect that are likely to affect further image analysis and classification accuracy. This paper presents a methodology for the selection of appropriate hyperspectral bands from the EO-1 Hyperion image for the identification and mapping of mangrove species and coastal landcover types in the Bhitarkanika coastal forest region, eastern India. Band selection procedure follows class based elimination procedure and the separability of the classes are tested in the band selection process. Individual bands are de-correlated and redundant bands are removed from the bandwise correlation matrix. The percent contribution of class variance in each band is analysed from the factors of PCA component ranking. Spectral bands are selected from the wavelength groups and statistically tested. Further, the band selection procedure is compared with similar techniques (Band Index and Mutual information) for validation. The number of bands in the Hyperion image was reduced from 196 to 88 by the Factor-based ranking approach. Classification was performed by Support Vector Machine approach. It is observed that the proposed Factor-based ranking approach performed well in discriminating the mangrove species and other landcover units compared to the other statistical approaches. The predominant mangrove species Heritiera fomes, Excoecaria agallocha and Cynometra ramiflora are spectral identified and the health status of these species are assessed by the selected band. Further, the performance of this band selection approaches are evaluated in multi-sensor image fusion for better mapping of mangrove ecosystems, wherein spatial resolution is enhanced while retaining the optimal number of hyperspectral bands.

TI  - Genetic diversity of vector-borne pathogens in spotted and brown hyenas from Namibia and Tanzania relates to ecological conditions rather than host taxonomy
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
AB  - Background Improved knowledge on vector-borne pathogens in wildlife will help determine their effect on host species at the population and individual level and whether these are affected by anthropogenic factors such as global climate change and landscape changes. Here, samples from brown hyenas (Parahyaena brunnea) from Namibia (BHNA) and spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta) from Namibia (SHNA) and Tanzania (SHTZ) were screened for vector-borne pathogens to assess the frequency and genetic diversity of pathogens and the effect of ecological conditions and host taxonomy on this diversity. Methods Tissue samples from BHNA (n = 17), SHNA (n = 19) and SHTZ (n = 25) were analysed by PCRs targeting Anaplasmataceae, Rickettsia spp., piroplasms, specifically Babesia lengau-like piroplasms, Hepatozoidae and filarioids. After sequencing, maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analyses were conducted. Results The relative frequency of Anaplasmataceae was significantly higher in BHNA (82.4%) and SHNA (100.0%) than in SHTZ (32.0%). Only Anaplasma phagocytophilum/platys-like and Anaplasma bovis-like sequences were detected. Rickettsia raoultii was found in one BHNA and three SHTZ. This is the first report of R. raoultii from sub-Saharan Africa. Babesia lengau-like piroplasms were found in 70.6% of BHNA, 88.9% of SHNA and 32.0% of SHTZ, showing higher sequence diversity than B. lengau from South African cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus). In one SHTZ, a Babesia vogeli-like sequence was identified. Hepatozoon felis-like parasites were identified in 64.7% of BHNA, 36.8% of SHNA and 44.0% of SHTZ. Phylogenetic analysis placed the sequences outside the major H. felis cluster originating from wild and domestic felids. Filarioids were detected in 47.1% of BHNA, 47.4% of SHNA and 36.0% of SHTZ. Phylogenetic analysis revealed high genetic diversity and suggested the presence of several undescribed species. Co-infections were frequently detected in SHNA and BHNA (BHNA median 3 pathogens, range 1-4; SHNA median 3 pathogens, range 2-4) and significantly rarer in SHTZ (median 1, range 0-4, 9 individuals uninfected). Conclusions The frequencies of all pathogens groups were high, and except for Rickettsia, multiple species and genotypes were identified for each pathogen group. Ecological conditions explained pathogen identity and diversity better than host taxonomy. Graphic

AB  - The adaptation of agriculture and forestry to the climate of the twenty-first century supposes that research projects will be conducted cooperatively between meteorologists, agronomists, soil scientists, hydrologists, and modellers. To prepare for it, it is appropriate first of all to study the variations in the climate of the past using extensive, homogenised series of meteorological or phenological data. General circulation models constitute the basic tool in order to predict future changes in climate. They will be improved, and the regionalisation techniques used for downscaling climate predictions will also be made more efficient. Crop simulation models using input data from the general circulation models applied at the regional level ought to be the favoured tools to allow the extrapolation of the major trends on yield, consumption of water, fertilisers, pesticides, the environment and rural development. For this, they have to be validated according to the available agronomical data, particularly the available phenological series on cultivated crops. In addition, climate change would have impact on crop diseases and parasites, as well as on weeds. Very few studies have been carried out in this field. It is also necessary to quantify in a more accurate way the stocks and fluxes of carbon in large forest ecosystems, simulate their future, and assess the vulnerability of the various forest species to a change in climate. This is all the more important in that some propagate species choices must be made in the course of the next ten years in plantations which will experience changed climate. More broadly speaking, we shall have not only to try hard to research new agricultural and forestry practices which will reduce greenhouse gas emissions or promote the storage of carbon, but it will also be indispensable to prepare the adaptation of numerous rural communities for the climate change (with special reference to least developed countries in tropical areas, where malnutrition is a common threat). This can be accomplished with a series of new environmental management practices suited to the new climatic order.

TI  - The epidemiology of tick-borne relapsing fever in the United States
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Each year, many residents of and visitors to endemic regions of the western United States are exposed to the vector of tick-borne relapsing fever (TBRF), an underrecognized and underreported disease. Through review of report forms and literature review, we identified 450 cases of TBRF acquired in the United States in 11 western states (and in British Columbia by a U.S. resident) from January 1977 to January 2000. Exposure sites were in forested areas, at varying elevations, in mountainous regions (Cascade, Rocky Mountain, San Bernardino, and Sierra Nevada ranges) of the United States and Canada and in limestone caves in central Texas, Only 13 counties accounted for approximately 50% of all cases. Forty percent of the cases were not residents of the state where TBRF exposure occurred, including 7% from I I states where TBRF is not endemic. TBRF is endemic in the United States and is a disease affecting travelers, who may return home with the disease to areas where physicians are not familiar with it.

TI  - INCIDENCE, DISTRIBUTION AND SEVERITY OF BACTERIAL DISEASES ON RICE IN WEST AFRICA
T2  - TROPICAL PEST MANAGEMENT
AB  - The incidence, distribution and severity of bacterial diseases of rice was studied in West Africa.  Two bacterial diseases - the bacterial leaf streak caused by Xanthomonas campestris pv. oryzicola and bacterial leaf blight caused by Xanthomonas campestris pv. oryzae-were detected.  Both bacterial diseases were found to be more prevalent and severe in the Sahelian than in the forest zone of West Africa.  They are rarely found in the more humid zone of West Africa.  Bacterial leaf blight was found to be more widely distributed in the Sahelian region than the bacterial leaf streak.  The incidence of bacterial leaf blight was found to be aggravated by high dosages of nitrogen.  Lossese ranging from 2.7% to 41.0% in grain yield were inflicted on the rice crop by bacterial leaf blight.  Some control measures are recommended.

TI  - Regional modeling of climate change impacts on smallholder agriculture and ecosystems in Central America
T2  - CLIMATIC CHANGE
AB  - Climate change will have serious repercussions for agriculture, ecosystems, and farmer livelihoods in Central America. Smallholder farmers are particularly vulnerable due to their reliance on agriculture and ecosystem services for their livelihoods. There is an urgent need to develop national and local adaptation responses to reduce these impacts, yet evidence from historical climate change is fragmentary. Modeling efforts help bridge this gap. Here, we review the past decade of research on agricultural and ecological climate change impact models for Central America. The results of this review provide insights into the expected impacts of climate change and suggest policy actions that can help minimize these impacts. Modeling indicates future climate-driven changes, often declines, in suitability for Central American crops. Declines in suitability for coffee, a central crop in the regional economy, are noteworthy. Ecosystem models suggest that climate-driven changes are likely at low- and high-elevation montane forest transitions. Modeling of vulnerability suggests that smallholders in many parts of the region have one or more vulnerability factors that put them at risk. Initial adaptation policies can be guided by these existing modeling results. At the same time, improved modeling is being developed that will allow policy action specifically targeted to vulnerable groups, crops, and locations. We suggest that more robust modeling of ecological responses to climate change, improved representation of the region in climate models, and simulation of climate influences on crop yields and diseases (especially coffee leaf rust) are key priorities for future research.

TI  - Entomological risk of African tick-bite fever (<i>Rickettsia africae</i> infection) in Eswatini
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   Rickettsia africae is a tick-borne bacterium that causes African tick-bite fever (ATBF) in humans. In southern Africa, the tick Amblyomma hebraeum serves as the primary vector and reservoir for R. africae and transmits the bacterium during any life stage. Previous research has shown that even when malaria has been dramatically reduced, unexplained acute febrile illnesses persist and may be explained by the serological evidence of rickettsiae in humans.
   Methodology/Principal findings
   We collected 12,711 questing Amblyomma larvae across multiple land use types in a savanna landscape in Eswatini. Our results show that host-seeking Amblyomma larvae are abundant across both space and time, with no significant difference in density by land use or season. We investigated the entomological risk (density of infected larvae) of ATBF from A. hebraeum larvae by testing over 1,600 individual larvae for the presence of R. africae using a novel multiplex qPCR assay. We found an infection prevalence of 64.9% (95% CI: 62.167.6%) with no land use type significantly impacting prevalence during the dry season of 2018. The mean density of infected larvae was 57.3 individuals per 100m(2) (95% CI: 49-65 individuals per 100m(2)).
   Conclusions
   Collectively, our results demonstrate R. africae infected A. hebraeum larvae, the most common tick species and life stage to bite humans in southern Africa, are ubiquitous in the savanna landscape of this region. Increased awareness of rickettsial diseases is warranted for policymakers, scientists, clinicians, and patients. Early detection of disease via increased clinician awareness and rapid diagnostics will improve patient outcomes for travelers and residents of this region.

TI  - Prediction of Drug-Target Interaction on Jamu Formulas using Machine Learning Approaches
T2  - 2019 11TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS (ICACSIS 2019)
CP  - 11th International Conference on Advanced Computer Science and Information Systems (ICACSIS)
AB  - Jamu is an Indonesian herbal medicine that has many benefits. Prediction of drug-target interactions on Jamu formula using a graph-based approach was carried out, but the results were unsatisfactory with the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPR) of 0.70. This study develops a prediction model of drug-target interactions with machine learning approach using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF). The dataset used in this study as the same as the dataset in the previous research, obtained from Indonesian Jamu Herbs (IJAH) Analytics. The dataset represents interactions of compounds and proteins, including labels to indicate those of interactions. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used as feature reduction in the pre-processing stage. The prediction models using SVM and RF combined with PCA obtain the best AUPR results of 0.99. These results indicate that the machine learning approach has better performance than those of the graph-based approach in predicting drug-target interactions on Jamu formulas.

TI  - Considerations of potential vectors and animal reservoirs in an emerging cutaneous leishmaniasis area in <i>Sao Domingos</i> ranch, <i>Parana State</i> in Southearn Brazil
T2  - REVISTA DO INSTITUTO DE MEDICINA TROPICAL DE SAO PAULO
AB  - The aim of this study was to better understand the dynamics of Leishmania sand flies and reservoirs in Sao Domingos ranch, Arapongas municipality, Parana State, an anthropic environment in an endemic area of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL). Sand flies were collected in wild animal burrows, residences and in the forest, with Falcao light trap (FA), Shannon trap (SH) and quadrangular pyramidal trap (QP). The search for Leishmania was made on sand flies, biological samples of wild rodents and dogs using PCR and culture; while parasite direct search (DS) was carried out on animal skin lesions; infection of gold hamsters; and indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) test in dog blood samples. Eighty eight (88) sand flies were collected with FA traps and 526 sand flies using the SH trap, with a predominance of Pintomyia fischeri. Six hundred and one (601) specimens of Brumptomyia brumpti were collected in armadillo burrows, with the QP trap. Seventeen (17) wild rodents were captured, six of them had skin lesions with characteristics of Leishmania infection. Even though no positive test was found for Leishmania, epidemiological surveillance should be maintained, remembering that the human buildings are situated only 50 m from the forest. Considering the species of wild animals and sandflies found in Sao Domingos, the negative test found do not exclude the existence of the Leishmania transmission cycle in this preservation area.

TI  - Spatial-temporal analysis of Ross River virus disease patterns in Queensland, Australia
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Ross River virus is the most common vector-borne disease in Australia, with the majority of notifications being in Queensland. This study describes a retrospective spatial analysis of Queensland Ross River virus disease notifications spanning a 10-year period. Notifications were mapped to the local government area (LGA) of the residence of the patient. Ross River virus disease outbreaks within each LGA were detected by applying a Poisson model. Estimates of the seasonal incidence rates indicated wide variation between seasons and LGAs. Positive spatial autocorrelation between LGAs experiencing outbreaks indicated that LGAs within the same region often experience outbreaks at the same time. A hierarchical cluster analysis of the outbreak data was used to group LGAs with similar temporal outbreak patterns. This analysis highlights the variability in Ross River virus disease notification rates across Queensland, and provides a robust method for identifying disease outbreaks.

TI  - It Is a Long Way to GM Agriculture
T2  - ANNUAL REVIEW OF PLANT BIOLOGY, VOL 62
AB  - When we discovered that crown gall induction on plants by Agrobacterium tumefaciens is a natural event of genetic engineering, we were convinced that this was the dawn of a new era for plant science. Now, more than 30 years later, I remain overawed by how far and how rapidly we progressed with our knowledge of the molecular basis of plant growth, development, stress resistance, flowering, and ecological adaptation, thanks to the gene engineering technology. I am impressed, but also frustrated by the difficulties of applying this knowledge to improve crops and globally develop a sustainable and improved high-yielding agriculture. Now that gene engineering has become so efficient, I had hoped that thousands of teams, all over the world, would work on improving our major food crops, help domesticate new ones, and succeed in doubling or tripling biomass yields in industrial crops. We live in a world where more than a billion people are hungry or starving, while the last areas of tropical forest and wild nature are disappearing. We urgently need a better supply of raw material for our chemical industry because petroleum-based products pollute the environment and are limited in supply. Why could this new technology not bring the solutions to these challenges? Why has this not happened yet; what did we do wrong?

TI  - Diversity patterns, <i>Leishmania</i> DNA detection, and bloodmeal identification of Phlebotominae sand flies in villages in northern Colombia
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Leishmaniases are neglected tropical diseases exhibiting complex transmission cycles due to the number of parasite species circulating, sand fly species acting as vectors and infected mammals, including humans, which are defined in the New World as accidental hosts. However, current transmission scenarios are changing, and the disease is no longer exclusively related to forested areas but urban transmission foci occur, involving some species of domestic animals as suspected reservoirs. The aim of this study was to determine the transmission cycles in urban environments by evaluating sand fly diversity, detection of Leishmania DNA, and bloodmeal sources through intra and peridomestic collections. The study was carried out in Colombia, in 13 municipalities of Cordoba department, implementing a methodology that could be further used for the evaluation of vector-borne diseases in villages or towns. Our sampling design included 24 houses randomly selected in each of 15 villages distributed in 13 municipalities, which were sampled in two seasons in 2015 and 2016. Sand flies were collected using CDC light traps placed in intra and peridomestic habitats. In addition to the morphological identification, molecular identification through DNA barcodes was also performed. A total of 19,743 sand flies were collected and 13,848 of them (10,268 females and 3,580 males) were used in molecular procedures. Circulation of two known parasite species-Leishmania infantum and Leishmania panamensis was confirmed. Blood source analyses showed that sand flies fed on humans, particularly in the case of the known L. infantum vector, P. evansi; further analyses are advised to evaluate the reservoirs involved in parasite transmission. Our sampling design allowed us to evaluate potential transmission cycles on a department scale, by defining suspected vector species, parasite species present in different municipalities and feeding habits.

TI  - The primate community of the Lope Reserve, Gabon: Diets, responses to fruit scarcity, and effects on biomass
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY
AB  - The diets of all diurnal primates (Gorilla g. gorilla, Pan t. troglodytes, Mandrillus sphinx Colobus satanas, Cercocebus albigena, Cercopithecus nictitans, C. pogonias, C. cephus) in the Lope Reserve, central Gabon, are described from qualitative and quantitative data collected over 10 years. A total of 397 foods were recorded, of which 91% were from plants. The diets of seven of the eight species were numerically dominated by fruit, the exception being Colobus satanas with a diet dominated by seeds. When proportion of feeding time was examined, fruit remained the dominant food class for six species, while Cercocebus albigena, like the black colobus, spent most time feeding on seeds. The number of foods recorded per species ranged from 46-220, but dietary breadth of the four species that have not been subjects of detailed study was certainly underestimated. Almost half of the foods (46%) were eaten by only one species, and only four (1%) were recorded for all eight species. At Lope, fruit is scarce for 2-3 months during the annual dry season, and fruit crop failures can prolong this period of scarcity to as many as 8 months in some years. When fruit is scarce, the diets of all species changed to include more nonfruit foods, but chimpanzees and the three species of guenons maintained a fruit dominated diet. The total biomass of the Lope primate community is 374 kg/km(2), which is low compared to other sites in tropical Africa. Within the Lope community, biomass correlates negatively with degree of frugivory, suggesting that fruit availability may be critical, but this does not explain the low total biomass compared to other sites. Neither floristic diversity nor the composition of the primate community at Lope can account for the low biomass. While historical events such as climate-induced changes in forest cover, disease, or impact of human activities cannot be ruled out, we conclude that the most likely explanation of low primate biomass is the occurrence of an ecological ''catastrophe'' in the fairly recent past from which populations have not yet recovered. We believe that the most likely scenario was climate-mediated disturbance of flowering of important fruit food species. Prolonged fruit scarcity would have caused mortalities and affected the most frugivorous species more severely. (C) 1997 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

T2  - REVISTA DA SOCIEDADE BRASILEIRA DE MEDICINA TROPICAL
AB  - Introduction: The influx and efflux of military personnel in the possible endemic areas of leishmaniasis provided the impetus for research on the sandflies on Marambaia Island. Methods: Sandflies were collected with light traps installed in the 3 ecotypes of 3 areas chosen for their particular landscape aspects. Results: In 2009, were collected 32,006 specimens of sandflies belonging to 13 species. The species that showed highest density were Nyssomyia intermedia and Migoneimyia migonei. Conclusions: N. intermedia and M migonei are the principal vectors of American tegumentary leishmaniasis (ATL) in Brazil; thus, extension studies related to the eco-epidemiology of these species of Marambaia Island are essential.

AB  - The shells of dead snails collect water from rainfalls producing aquatic microenvironments called gastrotelmata. These habitats are small and hold simple detritus based on animal communities, being rotifers and culicids the most studied. Although a high diversity of aquatic microhabitats has been reported as larval habitats of mosquitoes in Argentina, the shell of snails has not been investigated yet. We report the shells of three species of native Megalobulimus genus as larval habitats of a neotropical mosquito and suspected vector of bunyaviruses, Limatus durhamii, and describe these microhabitats in the Yungas forest of Argentina.

TI  - Identification of promising nutraceuticals against filarial immune-modulatory proteins: insights from <i>in silico</i> and <i>ex vivo</i> studies
T2  - RSC ADVANCES
AB  - Lymphatic filariasis is a neglected tropical disease affecting over 863 million people in 47 countries of the world. The anti-filarial drugs, diethylcarbamazine, albendazole, and ivermectin, are effective only at the larval stages and have proven completely ineffective as adulticides. Besides this, a long-term use of these drugs is associated with several side effects including drug toxicity. Nutraceuticals have emerged as better alternatives for long term treatments due to their safety and lesser side effects. In the present work, we have used drug docking analysis and molecular dynamics simulation approaches to explore the effect of anti-inflammatory nutraceuticals against the immune-modulatory proteins of filarial worms. The filarial proteins enolase, ES-62 precursor, serpin, and cystatin, which are highly efficient in host immune modulation were targeted with more than 50 nutraceuticals. In the in silico study nutraceuticals such as naringin, beta-carotene, and emodin showed higher binding efficacy and lower dissociation constant as compared to anti-filarial drugs. Molecular dynamics simulation results showed that immune-modulatory proteins formed highly stable complexes with naringin, beta-carotene, and emodin over the entire MD simulation run. The nutraceutical emodin formed the most stable system in silico and hence its effect was investigated on adult filarial parasites under ex vivo conditions too. Emodin significantly affected the motility, viability, ROS production, and genomic DNA fragmentation of filarial parasites. Further in vivo and in vitro studies will help in understanding the mechanism of action of emodin at the molecular level and would help in the development of more effective anti-filarial drugs.

TI  - Prevalence and diversity of small rodent-associated <i>Bartonella</i> species in Shangdang Basin, China
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence and molecular characteristics of Bartonella infections in small rodents in the Shangdang Basin, China. Small rodents were captured using snap traps, and their liver, spleen, and kidney tissues were harvested for Bartonella detection and identification using a combination of real-time PCR of the ssrA gene (296 bp) and conventional PCR and sequencing of the gltA gene (379 bp). Results showed that 55 of 147 small rodents to be positive for Bartonella, with a positivity rate of 37.41%, and 95% confidence interval of 29.50%- 45.33%. While the positivity rate across genders (42.62% in males and 33.72% in females, chi(2) = 1.208, P = 0.272) and tissues (28.57% in liver, 33.59% in spleen, and 36.76% in kidney, chi(2) = 2.197, P = 0.333) of small rodents was not statistically different, that in different habitats (5.13% in villages, 84.44% in forests, and 54.17% in farmlands, chi(2) = 80.105, P<0.001) was statistically different. There were 42 Bartonella sequences identified in six species, including 30 B. grahamii, three B. phoceensis, two B. japonica, two B. queenslandensis, one B. fuyuanensis and four unknown Bartonella species from Niviventer confucianus, Apodemus agrarius and Tscherskia triton. In addition to habitat, Bartonella species infection could be affected by the rodent species as well. Among the Bartonella species detected in this area, B. grahamii was the dominant epidemic species (accounting for 71.43%). B. grahamii exhibited four distinct clusters, and showed a certain host specificity. In addition, 11 haplotypes of B. grahamii were observed using DNASP 6.12.03, among which nine haplotypes were novel. Overall, high occurrence and genetic diversity of Bartonella were observed among small rodents in the Shangdang Basin; this information could potentially help the prevention and control of rodent-Bartonella species in this area.

TI  - Taxonomy of the African giant pouched rats (Nesomyidae: Cricetomys): molecular and craniometric evidence support an unexpected high species diversity
T2  - ZOOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY
AB  - Our study combined a mitochondrial cytochrome b phylogeny with cranial measurements from giant pouched rats collected across sub-Saharan Africa. The mitochondrial phylogeny resolves two West African clades and a clade with east and central Africa representatives. This last clade can be further divided into four subclades. Altogether they represent six species (Cricetomys gambianus, Cricetomys ansorgei, Cricetomys emini, and three undescribed taxa) that can be distinguished on the basis of their mitochondrial DNA sequences and craniometry. In the absence of adequate craniometric data the existence of Cricetomys kivuensis cannot be confirmed by our data. Our combined molecular and craniometric data allowed us to broadly delineate the distribution ranges of the detected species. Cricetomys gambianus occurs in the savannah and forest clearings of West Africa. Cricetomys ansorgei is distributed in the savannah of East and southern Africa. Cricetomys emini, as currently recognized across the Guineo-Congolian forest of Africa, is shown to be diphyletic. Cricetomys sp. 1, a separate operational taxonomic unit closely resembling C. emini, occurs in the forest zone of West Africa. An undescribed sister-species of C. ansorgei, Cricetomys sp. 2, occurs in the forest of Central Africa along the left bank of the Congo River. Cricetomys sp. 3 occurs on the right bank of the Congo River from Cameroon to the Republic of Congo, whereas the true C. emini also occurs on the right bank of the Congo River but appears to be restricted to the Democratic Republic of Congo. Cranial phenotype within the genus tends to conform to ecological zonation (either forest or savannah) rather than to phylogenetic affiliation of the species concerned, suggesting that diversifying selection across environmental gradients could be responsible for biological diversification within the genus.

TI  - Divergent impacts of warming weather on wildlife disease risk across climates
T2  - SCIENCE
AB  - Disease outbreaks among wildlife have surged in recent decades alongside climate change, although it remains unclear how climate change alters disease dynamics across different geographic regions. We amassed a global, spatiotemporal dataset describing parasite prevalence across 7346 wildlife populations and 2021 host-parasite combinations, compiling local weather and climate records at each location. We found that hosts from cool and warm climates experienced increased disease risk at abnormally warm and cool temperatures, respectively, as predicted by the thermal mismatch hypothesis. This effect was greatest in ectothermic hosts and similar in terrestrial and freshwater systems. Projections based on climate change models indicate that ectothermic wildlife hosts from temperate and tropical zones may experience sharp increases and moderate reductions in disease risk, respectively, though the magnitude of these changes depends on parasite identity.

TI  - Molecular networking-based chemical profiling and anti-influenza viral and neuroprotective effects of <i>Elaeocarpus hygrophilus</i> Kurz.
T2  - CHEMICAL PAPERS
AB  - Elaeocarpus hygrophilus Kurz. is a tropical tree that has recently been used for food and medicinal purposes. This study aimed to reveal the phytochemicals and evaluate the anti-influenza viral and neuroprotective effects of different parts of this plant including leaves, stems, fruit peels, and seeds. The study results indicated that the leaf extract was a potential candidate in the inhibition of the influenza viral replication through anti-neuraminidase receptors and attenuation of the glutamate-induced neuronal cell death and cellular oxidative stress. Using molecular networking as well as fragmentation, twenty-six known compounds were dereplicated from the leaves of E. hygrophilus. Molecular docking simulations of target proteins (PDB: 3CL0 and 4CXT) with these predicted compounds indicated that phenolic compounds from the EtOH leaf extract may be considered as active components for treating not only neuraminidase inhibitor-resistant strains but also activating Keap1/Nrf2 pathway. The anti-influenza viral and neuroprotective effects of the leaf extract and the link between the two activities could significantly contribute to the development of natural product drugs for influenza treatment and prevention of neuropsychiatric adverse events. These results suggested further research about the phytochemicals and the bio-guided isolation of the most active fractions from the leaf extract and their respective herbal drug formulations, with effective and secure aspects, to low-income populations of the tropics.

TI  - One year after the Zika virus outbreak in Brazil: from hypotheses to evidence
T2  - REVISTA DA SOCIEDADE BRASILEIRA DE MEDICINA TROPICAL
AB  - Zika virusis an arbovirus of the Flaviviridae family with two major strains, an Asian and an African strain. The main vectors involved in the transmission of Zika virus are the Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. Despite its identification, discovered in 1947 in the Zika forest in Uganda, only isolated and sporadic occurrences of human infection were reported within a largely asymptomatic proportion of individuals. The first reported outbreak occurred in 2007 in the Yap Island, which belongs to the Federated States of Micronesia in the Pacific Ocean, and in French Polynesia, where high attack rates occurred and the first cases of associated Guillain-Barre syndrome were reported. From November 2014 to early 2015, the Northeast states of Brazil reported the first outbreaks of Zika virus infection, with laboratory confirmation of Zika virus circulation in April 2015. In the second quarter of 2015, the association between Zika virus infection and neurological symptoms was confirmed in adults. Moreover, in October 2015 a novel suspicion was raised based on clinical and epidemiological observations: that an association between Zika virus infection and neonatal microcephaly may exist. A year after the first reports on Zika virus in Brazil, many hypotheses and much evidence on the patterns of involvement of the disease and its complications have been produced, both in this country and others; other hypotheses still need to be clarified. This review is a synthesis of a new chapter in the history of medicine; it outlines the main results produced.

TI  - Early Detection of Seasonal Outbreaks from Twitter Data Using Machine Learning Approaches
T2  - COMPLEXITY
AB  - Seasonal outbreaks have several different periods that occur primarily during winter in temperate regions, while influenza may occur throughout the year in tropical regions, triggering outbreaks more irregularly. Similarly, dengue occurs in the star of the rainy season in early May and reaches its peak in late June. Dengue and flu brought an impact on various countries in the years 2017-2019 and streaming Twitter data reveals the status of dengue and flu outbreaks in the most affected regions. This research work presents that Social Media Analysis (SMA) can be used as a detector of the epidemic outbreak and to understand the sentiment of social media users regarding various diseases. Providing awareness about seasonal outbreaks through SMA is an effective approach for researchers and healthcare responders to detect the early outbreaks. The proposed model aims to find the sentiment about the disease in tweets, and the seasonal outbreaks-related tweets are classified into two classes as disease positive and disease negative. This work proposes a machine-learning-based approach to detect dengue and flu outbreaks in social media platform Twitter, using four machine learning algorithms: Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Decision Tree (DT), with the help of Term Frequency and Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF). For experimental analysis, two datasets (dengue and flu) are analyzed individually. The experimental results show that the RF classifier has outperformed the comparison models in terms of improved accuracy, precision, recall, F1-measure, and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. The proposed work offers favorable performance with total precision, accuracy, recall, and F1-measure ranging from 84% to 88% for conventional machine learning techniques.

TI  - Filarial Antigenemia and <i>Loa loa</i> Night Blood Microfilaremia in an Area Without Bancroftian Filariasis in the Democratic Republic of Congo
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Implementation of mass drug administration for lymphatic filariasis (LF) has been delayed in central Africa because of incomplete mapping and coendemic loiasis. We mapped two regions in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo that were suspected to have LF. Night blood samples were collected from 2,724 subjects in 30 villages. Filarial antigenemia rates by card test exceeded 1% in 28 villages (range = 0-14%). Prevalence rates for large sheathed microfilariae (Mf) ranged from 4% to 40%; Mansonella perstans rates ranged from 22% to 98%. Large Mf were exclusively Loa loa by microscopy, and only 1 of 337 samples tested by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was positive for Wuchereria bancrofti DNA. Filarial antigen positivity was strongly associated with high L. loa Mf counts. Periodicity studies revealed atypical patterns, with no significant diurnal periodicity in some individuals. Thus, methods routinely used for LF mapping may not be reliable in areas in central Africa that are highly endemic for loiasis.

TI  - Clinical predictors for etiology of acute diarrhea in children in resource-limited settings
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background Diarrhea is one of the leading causes of childhood morbidity and mortality in lower- and middle-income countries. In such settings, access to laboratory diagnostics are often limited, and decisions for use of antimicrobials often empiric. Clinical predictors are a potential non-laboratory method to more accurately assess diarrheal etiology, the knowledge of which could improve management of pediatric diarrhea. Methods We used clinical and quantitative molecular etiologic data from the Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS), a prospective, case-control study, to develop predictive models for the etiology of diarrhea. Using random forests, we screened the available variables and then assessed the performance of predictions from random forest regression models and logistic regression models using 5-fold cross-validation. Results We identified 1049 cases where a virus was the only etiology, and developed predictive models against 2317 cases where the etiology was known but non-viral (bacterial, protozoal, or mixed). Variables predictive of a viral etiology included lower age, a dry and cold season, increased height-for-age z-score (HAZ), lack of bloody diarrhea, and presence of vomiting. Cross-validation suggests an AUC of 0.825 can be achieved with a parsimonious model of 5 variables, achieving a specificity of 0.85, a sensitivity of 0.59, a NPV of 0.82 and a PPV of 0.64. Conclusion Predictors of the etiology of pediatric diarrhea can be used by providers in low-resources setting to inform clinical decision-making. The use of non-laboratory methods to diagnose viral causes of diarrhea could be a step towards reducing inappropriate antibiotic prescription worldwide.
   Author summary Diarrhea is one of the leading causes of death in young children worldwide. In low-resource settings, diarrhea testing is not available or too expensive, and the decision to prescribe antibiotics is often made without testing. Using clinical information to predict which cases are caused by viruses, and thus wouldn't need antibiotics, would help to improve appropriate use of antibiotics. We used data from a large study of childhood diarrhea, paired with advanced statistical methods including machine learning, to come up with the top clinical factors that could predict a viral cause of diarrhea. We compared 1049 cases where a virus was the only cause, with 2317 cases where the cause was known but not a virus. We found that a lower age, dry and cold season, nutritional status defined by increased height, lack of blood diarrhea, and vomiting, were the clinical factors most predictive of whether the diarrhea was caused by a virus. We found that, using just those 5 factors, we were able to predict a viral cause with good accuracy. Our findings can be used by doctors to guide the appropriate use of antibiotics for diarrhea in children.

TI  - Nelfinavir, an HIV-1 Protease Inhibitor, Induces Oxidative Stress-Mediated, Caspase-Independent Apoptosis in <i>Leishmania</i> Amastigotes
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background: Visceral leishmaniasis has now emerged as an important opportunistic disease in patients coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1). Although the effectiveness of HIV-1 protease inhibitors, such as nelfinavir, in antiretroviral therapies is well documented, little is known of the impact of these drugs on Leishmania in coinfected individuals.
   Methodology and Principal Findings: Here, we show that nelfinavir generates oxidative stress in the parasite, leading to altered physiological parameters such as an increase in the sub-G1 DNA content, nuclear DNA fragmentation and loss of mitochondrial potential, which are all characteristics of apoptosis. Pretreatment of axenic amastigotes with the caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk did not inhibit the increase in sub-G1 DNA content in nelfinavir-treated parasites, suggesting therefore that this antiviral agent does not kill Leishmania amastigotes in a caspase-dependent manner. Furthermore, we observed that the mitochondrial resident protein endonuclease G is involved. We also demonstrate that parasites overexpressing GSH1 (the rate limiting enzyme of glutathione biosynthesis) were more resistant to nelfinavir when compared to untransfected controls.
   Conclusions and Significance: These data suggest that nelfinavir induces oxidative stress in Leishmania amastigotes, culminating in caspase-independent apoptosis, in which DNA is degraded by endonuclease G. This study provides a rationale for future, long-term design of new therapeutic strategies to test nelfinavir as a potential antileishmanial agent as well as for possible future use in Leishmania/HIV-1 coinfections.

TI  - Enteropathogen Changes After Rotavirus Vaccine Scale-up
T2  - PEDIATRICS
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To inform next steps in pediatric diarrhea burden reduction by understanding the shifting enteropathogen landscape after rotavirus vaccine implementation.
   METHODS: We conducted a case-control study of 1788 medically attended children younger than 5 years, with and without gastroenteritis, after universal rotavirus vaccine implementation in Peru. We tested case and control stools for 5 viruses, 19 bacteria, and parasites; calculated coinfection-adjusted attributable fractions (AFs) to determine pathogen-specific burdens; and evaluated pathogen-specific gastroenteritis severity using Clark and Vesikari scales.
   RESULTS: Six pathogens were independently positively associated with gastroenteritis: norovirus genogroup II (GII) (AF 29.1, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 28.0-32.3), rotavirus (AF 8.9, 95% CI: 6.8-9.7), sapovirus (AF 6.3, 95% CI: 4.3-7.4), astrovirus (AF 2.8, 95% CI: 0.0-4.0); enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli heat stable and/or heat labile and heat stable (AF 2.4, 95% CI: 0.6-3.1), and Shigella spp. (AF 2.0, 95% CI: 0.4-2.2). Among typeable rotavirus cases, we most frequently identified partially heterotypic strain G12P[8] (54 of 81, 67%). Mean severity was significantly higher for norovirus GII-positive cases relative to norovirus GII-negative cases (Vesikari [12.7 vs 11.8; P <.001] and Clark [11.7 vs 11.4; P = .016]), and cases in the 6- to 12-month age range relative to cases in other age groups (Vesikari [12.7 vs 12.0; P = .0002] and Clark [12.0 vs 11.4; P = .0016]).
   CONCLUSIONS: Norovirus is well recognized as the leading cause of pediatric gastroenteritis in settings with universal rotavirus vaccination. However, sapovirus is often overlooked. Both norovirus and sapovirus contribute significantly to the severe pediatric disease burden in this setting. Decision-makers should consider multivalent vaccine acquisition strategies to target multiple caliciviruses in similar countries after successful rotavirus vaccine implementation.

TI  - In Vitro Propagation of Dwarf Poinciana Using Temporary Immersion Bioreactors
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE FLORIDA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY, VOL 131, 2018
CP  - 131st Annual Meeting of the Florida-State-Horticultural-Society (FSHS)
AB  - The dwarf Poinciana (Caesalpinia pulcherrima L.) is a tropical tree in the Fabaceae family. It is fast-growing and produces a stunning arrangement of red, orange, and yellow flowers, and is highly desirable for home and roadside landscaping. The species also has medicinal properties, producing antibacterial and antiviral compounds. Seed germination and rooting of cuttings are the usual methods for propagation of this species. However, seed material usually lacks uniformity and cuttings do not root properly. Furthermore, traditional propagation methods are prone to disease infection. Therefore, the development of a large-scale in vitro propagation system would be of benefit to the nursery industry to allow the production of a large number of uniform and disease-free plant material. The objective of this study is to develop a system for in vitro propagation of dwarf poinciana using advanced temporary immersion bioreactor technology. Different plant growth regulators were evaluated at different concentrations for induction of pro-embryogenic masses (PEMs) and consequently, somatic embryos. Preliminary results indicate that 2,4-D resulted in higher induction of PEMs and conversion of PEMS into somatic embryos. However, somatic embryo formation was low and new studies are necessary to fine tune the concentrations of both 2,4-D and 6-BA in combination to optimize somatic embryo formation. Subsequently, studies will focus on somatic embryo conversion into plantlets, which will be placed in the greenhouse for acclimatization and eventually transferred to the field for performance evaluation.

TI  - Comparative metatranscriptomics reveals decline of a neustonic planktonic population
T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
AB  - The neuston layer in tropical seas provides a good model to study the effects of increased levels of different stressors (e.g., temperature, ultraviolet radiation and Trichodesmium blooms). Here, we use a comparative in situ metatranscriptomics approach to reveal the functional genomic composition of metabolically active neustonic mesozooplankton community in response to the summer conditions in the Red Sea. The neustonic population exhibited changes in composition and abundance with a significant decline in copepods and appendicularia in July, when Trichodesmium cells were more abundant along with high temperatures and UV-B radiation. Nearly 23,000 genes were differentially expressed at the community level when the metatranscriptomes of the neustonic zooplankton were compared in April, July, and October. On a wider Phylum level, the genes related to oxidative phosphorylation, carbon, nucleotides, amino acids, and lipids were significantly overrepresented in both arthropods and chordates in April and October. On organism level for copepods, expression of genes responsive to oxidative stress, defense against bacteria, immune response, and virus reproduction were increased along with the observed increased appearance of copepod carcasses in the samples collected during July. The differences in expression correspond either to secondary effects of the Trichodesmium bloom or more likely to the increased UV-B radiation in July. Given the dearth of information on the zooplankton gene expression in response to environmental stimuli, our study provides the first transcriptome landscape of the mesozooplankton community during a period of increased mortality of the copepod and appendicularia population.

TI  - Indicator Framework for Monitoring Ecosystem Integrity of Coral Reefs in the Western Caribbean
T2  - OCEAN SCIENCE JOURNAL
AB  - Ecosystem monitoring is a key priority for evaluating ecosystem conditions, but high costs, especially with regard to marine ecosystems, hamper its large-scale implementation. Despite a wide range of monitoring programs for tropical coral reefs, it has not been possible to establish a minimum set of the most relevant metrics. This leads to heterogeneous methods, the collection of different metrics that are difficult to compare and lengthy, time- and money-consuming surveys. In the present study, we use ecosystem integrity as an underlying conceptual framework to establish a minimum set of metrics for evaluating the ecosystem condition of Caribbean coral reefs. We reviewed ten existing monitoring protocols for their conceptual framework, metrics used, their reference ranges and sampling methods and documented the ecological relevance of indicators, as reported in the literature. Of the 64 in situ metrics, 15 with high ecological relevance were selected as a minimum set, covering aspects of composition (Hill numbers for corals and fish), structure (coral, red algae, macroalgae and filamentous algae cover, topographic complexity, and habitat extent) and function (recruit density, disease and bleaching incidence, fish biomass, and filamentous and macroalgae height) of coral reefs across a range of ecological scales. Besides the lack of underlying conceptual frameworks and reference levels for specific regions in existing monitoring protocols, landscape scale and connectivity metrics are also missing, producing negative impacts on indicator interpretation. The presented indicator framework constitutes a valuable guideline, as it documents the most relevant metrics for ecosystem condition, considering composition, structure, and function.

TI  - Detection of <i>Bartonella</i> sp. and a novel spotted fever group <i>Rickettsia</i> sp. in Neotropical fleas of wild rodents (Cricetidae) from Southern Brazil
T2  - COMPARATIVE IMMUNOLOGY MICROBIOLOGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB  - The Neotropical region shows a great diversity of fleas, comprising more than 50 genera. The importance of the study of fleas is linked to their potential role as disease vectors. The aim of this study is to investigate the presence of Rickettsia spp. and Bartonella spp. in Neotropical fleas collected from wild rodents in Southern Brazil. From 350 rodents captured, 30 were parasitized by fleas. A total of 61 fleas belonging to two genera and six different species were collected (Craneopsylla minerva minerva, Polygenis occidentalis occidentalis, Polygenis platensis, Polygenis pradoi, Polygenis rimatus, and Polygenis roberti roberti). In 13 % of fleas of three different species (C. minerva, P. platensis, and P. pradoi) Rickettsia sp. DNA was found. Phylogenetic analysis of concatenated sequences of gltA, htrA, and ompA genes showed that Rickettsia sp. found in rodent fleas (referred as strain Taim) grouped together with Spotted Fever Group Rickettsia. In reference to Bartonella spp., five genotypes were identified in seven fleas of two species (C. minerva and P. platensis) and in five rodent spleens. Also, 207 frozen samples of wild rodents were screened for these pathogens: while none was positive for Rickettsia spp.; five rodent spleens were PCR-positive for Bartonella spp.. Herein, we show the detection of potential novel variants of Bartonella sp. and Rickettsia sp. in fleas collected of wild rodents from Southern Brazil. Further studies are needed to fully characterize these microorganisms, as well as to improve the knowledge on the potential role of Neotropical flea species as diseases vectors.

TI  - A myovirus encoding both photosystem I and II proteins enhances cyclic electron flow in infected <i>Prochlorococcus</i> cells
T2  - NATURE MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Cyanobacteria are important contributors to primary production in the open oceans. Over the past decade, various photosynthesis-related genes have been found in viruses that infect cyanobacteria (cyanophages). Although photosystem II (PSII) genes are common in both cultured cyanophages and environmental samples(1-4), viral photosystem I (vPSI) genes have so far only been detected in environmental samples(5,6). Here, we have used a targeted strategy to isolate a cyanophage from the tropical Pacific Ocean that carries a PSI gene cassette with seven distinct PSI genes (psaJF, C, A, B, K, E, D) as well as two PSII genes (psbA, D). This cyanophage, P-TIM68, belongs to the T4-like myoviruses, has a prolate capsid, a long contractile tail and infects Prochlorococcus sp. strain MIT9515. Phage photosynthesis genes from both photosystems are expressed during infection, and the resultant proteins are incorporated into membranes of the infected host. Moreover, photosynthetic capacity in the cell is maintained throughout the infection cycle with enhancement of cyclic electron flow around PSI. Analysis of metagenomic data from the Tara Oceans expedition(7) shows that phages carrying PSI gene cassettes are abundant in the tropical Pacific Ocean, composing up to 28% of T4-like cyanomyophages. They are also present in the tropical Indian and Atlantic Oceans. P-TIM68 populations, specifically, compose on average 22% of the PSI-gene-cassette carrying phages. Our results suggest that cyanophages carrying PSI and PSII genes are likely to maintain and even manipulate photosynthesis during infection of their Prochlorococcus hosts in the tropical oceans.

TI  - Isolation and characterization of Indian isolates of camel pox virus
T2  - TROPICAL ANIMAL HEALTH AND PRODUCTION
AB  - In this study, we isolated and identified three camel pox viruses (CMLV) from two outbreaks of camel pox infection in camels associated with eruptions on cheeks, nostrils, limbs, scrotum, and sheath that occurred at different places of Bikaner district, Rajasthan (India). The scab specimens collected were subjected for virus isolation in Vero cell culture, and the isolated viruses were characterized by employing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing. The causative agent was identified as CMLV, based on A-type inclusion, B5R and C18L genes-specific PCRs and partial sequencing of these genes, which clearly confirmed that the outbreaks were caused by CMLV and identity of CMLV isolates. Further, phylogenetic analysis of partial C18L gene sequences have showed that Indian CMLV are clustered together with other reported isolates/strains.

TI  - Immunomodulatory effects and associated mechanisms of <i>Momordica charantia</i> and its phytochemicals
T2  - FOOD & FUNCTION
AB  - Momordica charantia L. (M. charantia), which is a member of the Cucurbitaceae family and widely distributed in tropical and subtropical regions, has been consumed as a vegetable and also used as herbal medicine for thousands of years worldwide. M. charantia has received great attention in biological and biomedical research due to its remarkable antidiabetic/hypoglycaemic, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antiviral and antitumour activities both in vivo and in vitro. Numerous studies have revealed that the typical health-promoting activities of M. charantia are mainly attributed to its phytochemicals including saponins, proteins/peptides, phenolic compounds, alkaloids, triterpenoids and polysaccharides. In particular, it has been attested that there is a strong relationship between the antidiabetic activity and the saponins and proteins of M. charantia. In recent years, studies on the immunoenhancing and immunostimulating effects of M. charantia have attracted much attention and made significant progress. Therefore, this review focuses on the immunomodulatory effects and associated mechanisms of M. charantia and its bioactive phytochemicals. The clinical applications of M. charantia in immune-related diseases are also discussed, aiming to broaden the exploration of M. charantia as a functional food.

TI  - Biological Parameters of <i>Scirtothrips dorsalis</i> (Thysanoptera: Thripidae) on Selected Hosts
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - Since its establishment in Florida in 2005, Scirtothrips dorsalis Hood, a highly polyphagous species, has become an economically important pest of ornamental plants and a potentially significant pest of vegetable and fruit crops. Fruit and vegetable production in Florida is trending toward significant adoption of organic methods and use of widely dispersed small fields in rapidly urbanizing landscapes. Landscape plants may serve as refugia from which S. dorsalis recruits can disperse to nearby fruit and vegetable plantings. Therefore, information on this pest's biology including how it is affected by various host species is needed to develop effective integrated pest management (IPM) programs. In the greenhouse and laboratory condition, we studied the effects of various host plants, development, did l flight activity, oviposition, and demographics of S. dorsalis. The pest preferred Jalapeno pepper and Knockout rose over the other hosts, and it was most active between 1000 and 1600 hours EST. Irrespective of the host species, the duration of each of the immature stadia varied within a narrow range, and their respective sizes were quite similar. Demographic parameters quantified included gross reproduction rate (GRR), net reproductive rate (R-o), intrinsic rate of increase per day (r(m)), finite rate of increase per day (lambda), and mean generation time (T). The pest population may increase by a factor of approximate to 1.09/d, so that it may double in 8 or 9d. The above information should be helpful in the development of sound programs to manage S. dorsalis on various crops and in the formulation of detection strategies by quarantine officers.

TI  - Perception and belief in oral health among Karen ethnic group living along Thai-Myanmar border, Thailand
T2  - BMC ORAL HEALTH
AB  - BackgroundUtilization of oral health services has been low among rural populations in Thailand, especially for minority ethnicity populations living along the borders. The aim of this study was to increase understanding of the determinants of the underutilization of oral health services among these populations.MethodsA qualitative study using in-depth interview and semi-structured interview was conducted among participants of Karen ethnicity living in Mae Tan Sub-district, Thasongyang District, Tak Province, Thailand. The interviews focused on exploring the participants' perceptions of oral health problems, oral health and hygiene, and oral health-seeking behaviors. The verbatim-transcribed interviews were analyzed using thematic analysis. ResultsA total of 101 participants (50 adults and 51 children) with a Karen ethnic background took part in the interviews. Most participants could not identify oral health problems and did not perceive dental disease as a problem unless there was severe pain that could not be relieved by painkillers. The Karen ethnic community worked as subsistence farmers, and their busy daily activities consisted of farming, going to the forest to hunt and gather, performing housework, and taking care of their children. Dental health was given a lower priority compared with general health. The perceived value of primary teeth was low, which was identified as an underlying factor resulting in delayed oral health care seeking among this population. The participants had relied on self-care throughout their lifetimes, using either traditional medicines or modern painkillers to relieve toothaches. Fear of dental procedures among children was also described as a barrier to seeking dental health care.ConclusionsThis study found that the lifestyle and traditions of Karen people living in this area influence their oral health care and hygiene activities as well as their health-seeking behaviors. Further research should emphasize how to improve oral health promotion by providing necessary services and health education appropriately to Karen ethnic populations living along the Thai-Myanmar border.

TI  - Light alters the impacts of nitrogen and foliar pathogens on the performance of early successional tree seedlings
T2  - PEERJ
AB  - Light limitation is a major driver of succession and an important determinant of the performance of shade-intolerant tree seedlings. Shade intolerance may result from a resource allocation strategy characterized by rapid growth and high metabolic costs, which may make shade-intolerant species particularly sensitive to nutrient limitation and pathogen pressure. In this study, we evaluated the degree to which nitrogen availability and fungal pathogen pressure interact to influence plant performance across different light environments. To test this, we manipulated nitrogen availability (high, low) and access by foliar fungal pathogens (sprayed with fungicide, unsprayed) to seedlings of the shade-intolerant tree, Liquidambar styraciflua, growing at low and high light availability, from forest understory to adjacent old field. Foliar fungal damage varied with light and nitrogen availability; in low light, increasing nitrogen availability tripled foliar damage, suggesting that increased nutrient availability in low light makes plants more susceptible to disease. Despite higher foliar damage under low light, spraying fungicide to exclude pathogens promoted 14% greater plant height only under high light conditions. Thus, although nitrogen availability and pathogen pressure each influenced aspects of plant performance, these effects were context dependent and overwhelmed by light limitation. This suggests that failure of shade-intolerant species to invade closed-canopy forest can be explained by light limitation alone.

TI  - Characterization of influenza infection in a high-income urban setting in Nairobi, Kenya
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HEALTH
AB  - Background Influenza viruses are an important cause of respiratory infections across all age groups. Information on occurrence and magnitude of influenza virus infections in different populations in Kenya however remains scanty, compromising estimation of influenza disease burden. This study examined influenza infection in an urban high-income setting in Nairobi to establish its prevalence and activity of influenza viruses, and evaluated diagnostic performance of a rapid influenza diagnostic test. Methodology A cross-sectional hospital-based study was conducted in six private health facilities located within high-income residential areas in Nairobi from January 2019 to July 2020. Patients of all ages presenting with influenza-like illness (ILI) were recruited into the study. Detection of influenza virus was conducted using rapid diagnosis and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Data were summarized using descriptive statistics and tests of association. Sensitivity, specificity and area under receiver operating characteristics curve was calculated to establish diagnostic accuracy of the rapid diagnosis test. Results The study recruited 125 participants with signs and symptoms of ILI, of whom 21 (16.8%) were positive for influenza viruses. Of all the influenza-positive cases, 17 (81.0%) were influenza type A of which 70.6% were pandemic H1N1 (A/H1N1 2009). Highest detection was observed among children aged 5-10 years. Influenza virus mostly circulated during the second half of the year, and fever, general fatigue and muscular and joint pain were significantly observed among participants with influenza virus. Sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic test was 95% (95% confidence interval 75.1-99.9) and 100% (95% confidence interval 96.5-100.0), respectively. Conclusions Findings of this study shows continuous but variable activity of influenza virus throughout the year in this population, with substantial disease burden. The findings highlight the need for continuous epidemiologic surveillance including genetic surveillance to monitor activity and generate data to inform vaccine introduction or development, and other interventions.

TI  - Investigation of <i>Borrelia</i> spp. in ticks (Acari: Ixodidae) at the border crossings between China and Russia in Heilongjiang Province, China
T2  - ASIAN PACIFIC JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE
AB  - Objective: To investigate the precise species of tick vector and the Borrelia spirochete pathogen at the Heilongjiang Province international border with Russia. Methods: In this study, ticks were collected from 12 Heilongjiang border crossings (including grasslands, shrublands, forests, and plantantions) to determine the rate and species type of spirochete-infected ticks and the most prevalent spirochete genotypes. Results: The ticks represented three genera and four species of the Ixodidae family [Ixodes persulcatus, Dermacentor silvarum, Haemaphysalis concinna and Haemaphysalis japonica]. Ixodes persulcatus had the highest amount of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato infection of 25.6% and the most common species of Borrelia isolated from Ixodes persulcatus was Borrelia garinii, strain PD91. Conclusions: Our results suggest that Borrelia garinii PD91-infected Ixodes persulcatus may be the principal cause of Lyme disease in the border crossing areas of Heilongjiang Province.

TI  - City puzzles: Does urban land scape affect genetic population structure in <i>Aedes aegypti</i>?
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Cities usually offer a suitable environment for the dengue vector Aedes aegypti, providing oviposition sites, accessibility to human hosts and nectar meals. However, large urban centres are highly heterogeneous environments, forming a patched landscape that could affect Ae. aegypti population dynamics and dispersal. Here, we performed a genome-wide analysis using Rad-seq data from 99 Ae. aegypti specimens collected in three areas within Buenos Aires city with varying levels of urbanization/land use: highly urbanized Area 1, intermediate Area 2 and poorly urbanized Area 3. We found an inverse association between urbanization levels and spatial genetic structure. Populations from highly urbanized Area 1 did not present genetic structure whereas two and three clusters were detected in Areas 2 and 3, respectively. In the case of Area 3, initial analyses showed separation in clusters was mostly due to elevated consanguinity within sites although three clusters were still detected after closely related individuals were discarded. Mosquitoes around each site displayed a high degree of isolation, evidencing a close dependence between the vector and human dwellings. Interestingly, specimens from distant boroughs (within the limits of the city) and the city's outskirts formed a single cluster with inner city sites (Area 1), highlighting the role of passive transport in shaping population structure. Genetic distances were poorly correlated with geographic distances in Buenos Aires, suggesting a stronger influence of passive than active dispersal on population structure. Only Area 2 displayed a significant isolation-by-distance pattern (p = 0.046), with males dispersing more than females (p = 0.004 and p = 0.016, respectively). Kinship analyses allowed us to detect full-siblings located 1.5 km apart in Area 1, which could be due to an extreme event of active female dispersal. Effective population size was higher in Area 2 confirming that cemeteries represent highly favourable environments for Ae. aegypti and need to be specifically targeted. Our results suggest that control programs should take into account urban landscape heterogeneity in order to improve vector control.
   Author summary
   Arboviral vector Aedes aegypti usually thrives in urban areas due to its close dependence of human dwellings on breeding sites and meals. However, urban landscapes are heterogeneous and present varying levels of urbanization and land use, affecting Ae. aegypti spatial structure and dispersal. We used nuclear Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms to analyze 99 Ae. aegypti specimens from three areas within the city of Buenos Aires: highly urbanized Area 1, intermediate urbanized Area 2 and poorly urbanized Area 3. We found an inverse association between urbanization levels and spatial genetic structure: mosquitoes from Area 1 did not present genetic structure. On the other hand, mosquitoes from Area 2 and 3 displayed 2 and 3 clusters, respectively. Human-mediated transport plays an important role in highly urbanized areas, connecting mosquito populations from distant locations. Potential active dispersal was detected in Area 1 where we found pairs of full-siblings located 1500m apart. In less urbanized areas, the distribution of breeding sites also affected spatial genetic structure. In Area 3, spatial structure was mostly due to consanguinity, but it also reflected the effect of urban landscape on Ae. aegypti population dynamics. Area 2 presented the highest effective population size. This could be partially explained by the advantageous conditions that cemeteries offer to vector populations which can also spill over surrounding neighbourhoods. Our results suggest that vector programs should consider the heterogeneity of urban landscapes to improve the effectiveness of control measures.

TI  - Temporal Patterns of Abundance of <i>Aedes aegypti</i> and <i>Aedes albopictus</i> (Diptera: Culicidae) and Mitochondrial DNA Analysis of <i>Ae</i>. <i>albopictus</i> in the Central African Republic
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - The invasive Asian tiger mosquito Aedes albopictus (Diptera: Culicidae) was first reported in central Africa in 2000, in Cameroon, with the indigenous mosquito species Ae. aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae). Today, this invasive species is present in almost all countries of the region, including the Central African Republic (CAR), where it was first recorded in 2009. As invasive species of mosquitoes can affect the distribution of native species, resulting in new patterns of vectors and concomitant risk for disease, we undertook a comparative study early and late in the wet season in the capital and the main cities of CAR to document infestation and the ecological preferences of the two species. In addition, we determined the probable geographical origin of invasive populations of Ae. albopictus with two mitochondrial DNA genes, COI and ND5. Analysis revealed that Ae. aegypti was more abundant earlier in the wet season and Ae. albopictus in the late wet season. Used tyres were the most heavily colonized productive larval habitats for both species in both seasons. The invasive species Ae. albopictus predominated over the resident species at all sites in which the two species were sympatric. Mitochondrial DNA analysis revealed broad low genetic diversity, confirming recent introduction of Ae. albopictus in CAR. Phylogeographical analysis based on COI polymorphism indicated that the Ae. albopictus haplotype in the CAR population segregated into two lineages, suggesting multiple sources of Ae. albopictus. These data may have important implications for vector control strategies in central Africa.
   Author SummaryAedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus are the main vectors of human arboviral diseases such as dengue and chikungunya. Ae. aegypti is indigenous in the Central African Republic (CAR), whereas Ae. Albopictus, originating from Asian forests, was first reported in 2009. To determine the consequences of this invasion of Ae. albopictus for epidemiological transmission of arboviruses, we conducted a comparative study in the early and late wet season in the capital, Bangui, and in the other main cities of the country to document infestation by the two species and their ecological preferences. In addition, we explored the geographical origin of populations of Ae. albopictus with two mitochondrial DNA genes (COI and ND5). We demonstrate that Ae. aegypti predominates early and Ae. albopictus late in the wet season. Ae. albopictus was the most prevalent species in almost all the sites investigated, except Bouar, where only Ae. aegypti was found, suggesting that Ae. albopictus tends to supplant Ae. aegypti in sympatric areas. Mitochondrial DNA analysis revealed broad low genetic diversity, confirming recent introduction of Ae. albopictus. Phylogeographical analysis with MtDNA COI gene suggested that Ae. albopictus in CAR came from multiple invasions and from multiple population sources.

TI  - Phytochemical Composition of Flower Essential Oil of <i>Plumeria alba</i> Grown in India
T2  - JOURNAL OF ESSENTIAL OIL BEARING PLANTS
AB  - Plumeria alba (Family: Apocynaceae), commonly known as temple tree/white frangipani is an ornamental, deciduous, tropical plant grown in landscape places, gardens, parks, and home premises for its beautiful and fragrant flowers. The different parts of white frangipani are traditionally used for the treatment of several diseases. This study was executed to identify the volatile constituents of the flower essential oil of P. alba from India, as this has not been studied to date. The essential oil composition was investigated through GC/MS analysis. The isolation of essential oil through the hydrodistillation method produced a yield of 0.05 +/- 0.01 %. A total of 46 volatile constituents were identified, representing 98.11 +/- 0.5 % of the total essential oil. The essential oil was rich in esters comprising 48.61 +/- 0.3 % of the essential oil followed by oxygenated monoterpene (15.41 +/- 0.1 %), oxygenated sesquiterpene (10.43 +/- 0.08 %) and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (10.39 +/- 0.1 %), etc. The dominant components of the essential oil were benzyl salicylate (33.98 +/- 0.04 %), benzyl benzoate (12.37 +/- 0.03 %), germacrene B (10.30 +/- 0.05 %), and linalool (8.17 +/- 0.11 %). Other notable constituents identified in the essential oil were (2Z,6Z)-farnesol, n-heneicosane, n-nonadecane, (Z, E)-geranyl linalool, trans-sabinene hydrate acetate, (2E,6Z)-farnesol, alpha-terpineol, n-docosane, geranyl benzoate, n-tricosane, alpha-bisabolol, nerol and 8-cedren-13-ol, etc. (1.17 % - 4.76 %).

TI  - Dramatic declines in neotropical salamander populations are an important part of the global amphibian crisis
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
AB  - We document major declines of many species of salamanders at several sites in Central America and Mexico, with emphasis on the San Marcos region of Guatemala, one of the best studied and most diverse salamander communities in the Neotropics. Profound declines of several formerly abundant species, including 2 apparent extinctions, are revealed. Terrestrial microhabitat specialists at mid- to high elevations have declined more than microhabitat generalists. These terrestrial microhabitat specialists have largely disappeared from multiple sites in western Guatemala, including in well-protected areas, suggesting that the phenomenon cannot be explained solely by localized habitat destruction. Major declines in southern Mexican plethodontid salamanders occurred in the late 1970s to early 1980s, concurrent with or preceding many reported frog declines. The species in decline comprise several major evolutionary lineages of tropical salamanders, underscoring that significant portions of the phylogenetic diversity of Neotropical salamanders are at risk. Our results highlight the urgent need to document and understand Neotropical salamander declines as part of the larger effort to conserve global amphibian diversity.

TI  - <i>Paramuricea clavata</i> (Anthozoa, Octocorallia) loss in the Marine Protected Area of Tavolara (Sardinia, Italy) due to a mass mortality event
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY-AN EVOLUTIONARY PERSPECTIVE
AB  - Recent studies highlight an increase in the frequency and intensity of marine mass mortalities of several species over the past 30-40 years, mainly in tropical and temperate areas. In the Mediterranean Sea these episodes particularly affect benthic suspension feeders, such as sponges and cnidarians. The main objective of this work was to document the loss of one of the main Mediterranean seascapes, Paramuricea clavata forests at the Marine Protected Area of Tavolara Punta Coda Cavallo, Sardinia (Italy), during the summer of 2008. Data regarding colony height, density, level of damage, and microbiological community were collected at two sites. Such parameters help us understand how mass mortality mechanisms act on this ecosystem engineer. We identified a change in size class distribution following a mass mortality that leaves mainly small colonies with a decrease in habitat complexity. Several tests on water chemistry demonstrate that the mortality event was not caused by local contamination. Moreover, microbiological tests on potential pathogenic agents suggest that bacteria belonging to the genus Vibrio are present as an opportunistic and not an etiological cause of P. clavata mortality events. Possible restoration approaches are discussed.

TI  - Characterization of Enteroviruses from Non-Human Primates in Cameroon Revealed Virus Types Widespread in Humans along with Candidate New Types and Species
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Enteroviruses (EVs) infecting African Non-Human Primates (NHP) are still poorly documented. This study was designed to characterize the genetic diversity of EVs among captive and wild NHP in Cameroon and to compare this diversity with that found in humans. Stool specimens were collected in April 2008 in NHP housed in sanctuaries in Yaounde and neighborhoods. Moreover, stool specimens collected from wild NHP from June 2006 to October 2008 in the southern rain forest of Cameroon were considered. RNAs purified directly from stool samples were screened for EVs using a sensitive RT-nested PCR targeting the VP1 capsid coding gene whose nucleotide sequence was used for molecular typing. Captive chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) were primarily infected by EV types already reported in humans in Cameroon and elsewhere: Coxsackievirus A13 and A24, Echovirus 15 and 29, and EV-B82. Moreover EV-A119, a novel virus type recently described in humans in central and west Africa, was also found in a captive Chimpanzee. EV-A76, which is a widespread virus in humans, was identified in wild chimpanzees, thus suggesting its adaptation and parallel circulation in human and NHP populations in Cameroon. Interestingly, some EVs harbored by wild NHP were genetically distinct from all existing types and were thus assigned as new types. One chimpanzee-derived virus was tentatively assigned as EV-J121 in the EV-J species. In addition, two EVs from wild monkeys provisionally registered as EV-122 and EV-123 were found to belong to a candidate new species. Overall, this study indicates that the genetic diversity of EVs among NHP is more important than previously known and could be the source of future new emerging human viral diseases.

TI  - Mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) of the Brazilian semiarid: dynamic interactions with biotic and abiotic factors
T2  - AUSTRAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - Mosquitoes are found worldwide; in Brazil, 530 species are distributed across all its biomes. Understanding of the biodiversity of the Caatinga biome remains incomplete, especially for Culicidae. We carried out a sampling of immature and adult mosquitoes in aquatic habitats and using Shannon traps in a seasonally dry tropical forest, in the semiarid of Rio Grande do Norte. A total of 1747 immatures of 13 species were collected during the study period (2017-2020) in groundwater sites, rock depressions, with and without vegetation, and tree holes. The maintenance of temporary breeding sites is related to the dry and rainy seasons. We collected 2132 adult mosquitoes of 12 species between 5 and 8 PM. Correlation analyses showed the effect of meteorological variables on Culicidae populations. Both immature and adult mosquitoes' abundance were significantly influenced by temperature and wind. The abundance of adult mosquitoes of the genera Aedes demonstrated a positive correlation with temperature, and a negative one with Mansonia and Uranotaenia. Our study adds information on the population dynamics of mosquitoes in the Brazilian semiarid, highlighting the bioecological relationships and breeding sites of species relevant to public health.

TI  - <i>Mycobacterium ulcerans</i> infection
T2  - LANCET
AB  - After tuberculosis and leprosy, Buruli-ulcer disease (caused by infection with Mycobacterium ulcerans) is the third most common mycobacterial disease in immunocompetent people. Countries in which the disease is endemic have been identified, predominantly in areas of tropical rain forest; the emergence of Buruli-ulcer disease in West African countries over the past decade has been dramatic. Current evidence suggests that the infection is transmitted through abraded skin or mild traumatic injuries after contact with contaminated water, soil, or vegetation; there is one unconfirmed preliminary report on possible transmission by insects. The clinical picture ranges from a painless nodule to large, undermined ulcerative lesions that heal spontaneously but slowly. Most patients are children. The disease is accompanied by remarkably few systemic symptoms, but occasionally secondary infections resulting in sepsis or tetanus cause severe systemic disease and death. Extensive scarring can lead to contractures of the limbs, blindness, and other adverse sequelae, which impose a substantial health and economic burden. Treatment is still primarily surgical, and includes excision, skin grafting, or both. Although BCG has a mild but significant protective effect, new vaccine developments directed at the toxins produced by M ulcerans are warranted. In West Africa, affected populations are underprivileged, and the economic burden imposed by Buruli-ulcer disease is daunting. Combined efforts to improve treatment, prevention, control, and research strategies (overseen by the WHO and funded by international relief agencies) are urgently needed.

TI  - Carrion fly-derived DNA as a tool for comprehensive and cost-effective assessment of mammalian biodiversity
T2  - MOLECULAR ECOLOGY
AB  - Large-scale monitoring schemes are essential in assessing global mammalian biodiversity, and in this framework, leeches have recently been promoted as an indirect source of DNA from terrestrial mammal species. Carrion feeding flies are ubiquitous and can be expected to feed on many vertebrate carcasses. Hence, we tested whether fly-derived DNA analysis may also serve as a novel tool for mammalian diversity surveys. We screened DNA extracted from 201 carrion flies collected in tropical habitats of Cote d'Ivoire and Madagascar for mammal DNA using multiple PCR systems and retrieved DNA sequences from a diverse set of species (22 in Cote d'Ivoire, four in Madagascar) exploiting distinct forest strata and displaying a broad range of body sizes. Deep sequencing of amplicons generated from pools of flies performed equally well as individual sequencing approaches. We conclude that the analysis of fly-derived DNA can be implemented in a very rapid and cost-effective manner and will give a relatively unbiased picture of local mammal diversity. Carrion flies therefore represent an extraordinary and thus far unexploited resource of mammal DNA, which will probably prove useful for future inventories of wild mammal communities.

TI  - Ecological aspects of the sandfly fauna (Diptera, Psychodidae) in an American cutaneous leishmaniasis endemic area under the influence of hydroelectric plants in Paranapanema river, State of Parana, Brazil
T2  - REVISTA DA SOCIEDADE BRASILEIRA DE MEDICINA TROPICAL
AB  - Introduction: An epidemiological study was undertaken to identify determinant factors in the occurrence of American cutaneous leishmaniasis in areas under the influence of hydroelectric plants in Paranapanema river, State of Parana, Brazil. The ecological aspects of the phlebotomine fauna were investigated. Methods: Sandflies were sampled with automatic light traps from February 2004 to June 2006 at 25 sites in the urban and rural areas of Itambaraca, and in Porto Almeida and Sao Joaquim do Pontal. Results: A total of 3,187 sandflies of 15 species were captured. Nyssomyia neivai predominated (34.4%), followed by Pintomyia pessoai (32.6%), Migonemyia migonei (11.6%), Nyssomyia whitmani (8.8%), and Pintomyia fischeri (2.7%), all implicated in the transmission of Leishmania. Males predominated for Ny. neivai, and females for the other vector species, with significant statistical differences (p < 0.001). Nyssomyia neivai, Pi. pessoai, Ny. whitmani, Brumptomyia brumpti, Mg. migonei, and Pi. fischeri presented the highest values for the Standardized Species Abundance Index (SSAI). The highest frequencies and diversities were found in the preserved forest in Porto Almeida, followed by forests with degradation in Sao Joaquim do Pontal and Vila Rural. Conclusions: Sandflies were captured in all localities, with the five vectors predominating. Ny. neivai had its highest frequencies in nearby peridomestic environments and Pi. pessoai in areas of preserved forests. The highest SSAI values of Ny. neivai and Pi. pessoai reflect their wider dispersion and higher frequencies compared with other species, which seems to indicate that these two species may be transmitting leishmaniasis in the area.

TI  - The Importance of Water Typologies in Lay Entomologies of <i>Aedes aegypti</i> Habitat, Breeding and Dengue Risk: A Study from Northern Australia
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE
AB  - Dengue fever is making a significant comeback globally and its control still depends largely on residents' actions. Community awareness and education are central to its management; however, programmes have had limited impact, because they are often based on short-term research and limited awareness of the socio-ecological contexts wherein local knowledge of dengue and its vectors (lay entomology) is produced and enacted in and through place. Long-term studies of lay knowledge of dengue vectors are very rare, even though they are essential to the development of effective, targeted community education campaigns and mobilisation. In this paper, we examine the popular belief that dengue vector, Aedes aegypti, is ubiquitous in the north Australian landscape and demonstrate how local typologies of water are central to the reasoning underwriting this assumption. We show how these logics are fortified by people's lived experiences of mosquitoes and the watery abodes they are thought to reside in, as well as through key messages from health education. We posit that long term, context-sensitive research approaches are better able to identify, understand and later address and challenge assumptions and may be more effective at informing, empowering and mobilizing the public to combat dengue fever.

TI  - The use of a vest equipped with a global positioning system to assess water-contact patterns associated with schistosomiasis
T2  - GEOSPATIAL HEALTH
AB  - The real exposure to many of the tropical diseases is difficult to assess at the individual-level due to problems of recall, self-reported diaries, personnel requirements, and altered behaviour related to observation. We present a study in all area endemic for Schistosoma japonicum in which global positioning system (GPS) receivers were used for personal time-activity monitoring to assess water-contact associated with schistosomiasis transmission. The study subjects were equipped with a vest with,in embedded GPS receiver for 8-hour periods. The resulting data were used to create hourly time-activity maps, which were subsequently used in interviews to ascertain thin timing and location of the water-contacts. Based oil a sample of twenty-four 8-four person-days we found that individuals averaged 1.4 +/- 1.2 water-contacts per day, and were surprisingly mobile, with 39%, of the participants having Spent time out of the village (0.8 +/- 1.4 hours Outside of village). Such mobility suggests the need for further research into social patterns that may facilitate the spread Of parasites, and contribute to sustained transmission. We present an assessment of the accuracy of cheaper commercially-available GPS units that have shown promise in Such applications. We feel that a speed-filtering method is effective in managing measurement errors commonly encountered during personal activity monitoring with GPS. We conclude that personal GPS units Call help reduce recall problems associated with other methods of assessing water-contact, and that they offer valuable insights into time-activity patterns that influence schistosomiasis transmission.

TI  - <i>Gymnema sylvestre</i> R. Br., an Indian Medicinal Herb: Traditional Uses, Chemical Composition, and Biological Activity
T2  - CURRENT PHARMACEUTICAL BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB  - Gymnema sylvestre R. Br. is one of the most important medicinal plants that grows in tropical forests in India and South East Asia. Its active ingredients and extracts of leaves and roots are used in traditional medicine to treat various ailments and they are present in the market for pharmaceutical and parapharmaceutical products. Commercial products based on substances of plant origin that are generally connoted as natural have to be subjected to monitoring and evaluation by health authorities for their potential impacts on public health. The monitoring and evaluation of these products are critical because the boundary between a therapeutic action and a functional or healthy activity has not yet been defined in a clear and unambiguous way. Therefore, these products are considered borderline products, and they require careful and rigorous studies, in order to use them as complement and/or even replacement of synthetic drugs that are characterized by side effects and high economic costs. This review explores the traditional uses, chemical composition and biological activity of Gymnema sylvestre extracts, providing a general framework on the most interesting extracts and what are the necessary studies for a complete definition of the range of activities.

TI  - Analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects in animal models of an ethanolic extract of Taheebo, the inner bark of <i>Tabebuia avellanedae</i>
T2  - MOLECULAR MEDICINE REPORTS
AB  - Taheebo, the purple inner bark of the Bignoniaceae tree Tabebuia avellanedae Lorentz ex Griseb, which is found in tropical rain forests in northeastern Brazil, has been used as a traditional medicine for various diseases for more than 1,500 years. In the current study, various animal models were used to demonstrate the analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties of its ethanolic extract, thereby investigating its potential as a therapeutic treatment for diseases with pain and inflammation. In the hot plate and writhing tests for the in vivo analgesic effect test of Taheebo, a 200 mg/kg dose of the extract induced a significant anti-nociceptive effect and increased the pain threshold by approximately 30% compared with the control. In vascular permeability and tetradecanoylphorbol acetate (TPA)-, arachidonic acid- and carrageenan-induced paw edema tests for anti-inflammatory effects, treatment with 200 mg/kg Taheebo led to significant anti-inflammatory effects and inhibited inflammation by 30-50% compared with the control. At 100 mg/kg, the extract decreased the levels of pain and inflammation in all tested models, but the degree of inhibition was not statistically significant. The results suggest that the ethanolic extract of the inner bark of Tabebuia avellanedae has the potential to be developed as a therapeutic or supportive drug against diseases with accompanying pain and inflammation, including osteoarthritis.

TI  - Evaluating the efficacy of various traps in catching tsetse flies at Nech Sar and Maze National Parks, Southwestern Ethiopia: An Implication for <i>Trypanosoma</i> Vector Control
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Tsetse flies are the vector of protozoan parasite of the genus Trypanosoma, the causative agent of human African sleeping sickness and animal trypanosomiasis. Traps such as Nguruman (NGU), biconical and sticky traps are in use for tsetse flies sampling and monitoring. However, there is no evidence regarding their comparative efficiency in catching flies using olfactory cues. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the efficiency of different types of traps in catching tsetse flies at Nech Sar and Maze National Parks, Southwestern Ethiopia. The study was done for six consecutive months from February to July 2019. Briefly, a 3x4 Latin square design was performed, and tsetse flies were collected for three days each month in four different vegetation types, including wood grassland, bush land, forest, and riverine forest. To avoid trapping position bias, rotation of traps has been done every day. Almost all (99.5%) of the flies were Glossina pallidipes and the remaining were G. fuscipes. The latter were present only at Maze national park. NGU traps were the most efficient type with 12.1 flies/trap/day at Nech Sar National Park and it was 2.2 flies/trap/day at Maze National Park followed by biconical and sticky traps. The number of tsetse flies collected by biconical trap was three-fold lower than NGU trap, and it was four-fold lower in sticky trap than NGU trap in both Nech Sar and Maze National Parks. A substantial number (41%) of G. pallidipes were collected from woody grassland (WGL). In conclusion, G. pallidipes monitoring and evaluation activities could consider NGU trap model as it performed better in most vegetation types in the region.
   Author summary
   African Animal Trypanosomiasis (AAT) or Nagana and Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) agents, are transmitted by a blood feeding vector called tsetse flies. In Animals, the disease is arguably the main constraint to an integrated livestock and crop production in sub-Saharan Africa, including Ethiopia. In humans, the disease is highly neglected. Vector control is considered to be one of the strategies to control the AAT and HAT. These interventions, however, need sampling and monitoring of vector distribution in disease endemic areas. This will be done using different tsetse traps. In Ethiopia, especially in southern and south-western regions, NGU (Nguruman), Biconical and Sticky traps are commonly used, but no evidences on the effectiveness of these traps in catching flies have been generated. Therefore, the measurement of traps efficiency and identification of the most effective one based on the type of vegetation in Nech Sar and Maze National Parks was the aim of this study. Our findings indicated that the NGU trap was the most effective model and the best-identified trap in most vegetation types in the region. This will help in monitoring the impact of interventions and for effective control of trypanosomiasis.

TI  - Current and potential distribution of <i>Myotis simus</i> (Chiroptera, Vespertilionidae)
T2  - MAMMALIA
AB  - Myotis simus is apparently restricted to tropical and subtropical South American lowlands, with a possible disjunction isolating northern and southern populations. Twenty-eight museum and literature records were assembled and analysed in the context of a taxonomic review of South American species of Myotis. In order to model the distribution of M. simus, to reveal putative areas of occurrence and environmental constraints to its distribution, as well as to test the previously proposed hypothesis of disjunct distribution, Maximum entropy algorithm (MaxEnt) was implemented on the information retrieved from the sampling localities, using nine environmental variables. Two regions with increased probability values were revealed in the Amazon and Parana basins, connected by a bottleneck in southeastern Bolivia, which provides further support for the previously proposed hypothesis of disjunctive distribution. The predicted distribution for M. simus was strongly associated with the drainage basins, precipitations of the driest quarter, mean temperatures of the warmest quarter and altitude. The Andean eastern slopes and the Guyana, Parana and Central Brazilian plateaus delimit the geographical distribution of M. simus, and the confirmed records document its presence in both terra firme and floodplain areas in lowland forest and savanna formations across South America.

TI  - Visitor or vector? The extent of rove beetle (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae) pollination and floral interactions
T2  - ARTHROPOD-PLANT INTERACTIONS
AB  - Beetles (Coleoptera) are a diverse group of overlooked pollinators, considered particularly important in tropical ecosystems. The role of the most diverse beetle family, Staphylinidae, as pollinators is generally considered minor, yet their relationships with plants are mostly unknown. Although often referred to as opportunistic visitors, it is arguable that the true extent of rove beetle pollination is underestimated given their frequency of visitation to flowers. This review comprehensively analysed the plant-pollinator or visitor interactions of the Staphylinidae and uncovered 108 well-described staphylinid-flower interactions across 27 seed plant families. Of these interactions, Staphylinidae were considered either potential or conclusive pollinators for 56 plant species, having either a primary or secondary role in pollination. Conversely, Staphylinidae were visitors to 40 plant species with a negligible role in pollination. For the remaining 12 interactions and additional anecdotal reports, the role of staphylinids as pollinators was unresolved. Staphylinid-flower interactions were most prevalent in the monocots and magnoliids (families: Araceae, Annonaceae, Arecaceae, and Magnoliaceae) involving predominantly generalist pollination systems, and interactions were limited to six staphylinid subfamilies (Omaliinae, Tachyporinae, Aleocharinae, Oxytelinae, Paederinae, and Staphylininae). Trends in the involvement of staphylinid subfamilies with particular plant lineages were identified, associated with differences in insect habit and floral rewards. Overall this review indicates that the role of Staphylinidae as pollinators, and Coleoptera as a whole, is underestimated. Caution, however, must be given to inferring the role of staphylinids in pollination because rove beetles commonly function as inadvertent secondary pollinators or antagonists there to fulfil other ecological roles.

TI  - Historical, cultural, political, and social influences on dietary patterns and nutrition in Australian Aboriginal children
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NUTRITION
CP  - International Colloquium on Fat Intake During Childhood
AB  - Before permanent European colonization 2 centuries ago, Australian Aborigines were preagriculturalist hunter-gatherers who had adapted extraordinarily well to Life in a variety of habitats ranging from tropical forests, coastal and riverine environments, savannah woodlands, and grasslands to harsh, hot, and very arid deserts. Colonization had serious negative effects on Aboriginal society, well-being, and health, so much so that Aborigines are now the unhealthiest subgroup in Australian society. The change from active and lean hunter-gatherers to a more sedentary group of people whose diet is now predominantly Westernized has had, and continues to have, serious effects on their health, particularly in relation to cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus, which are highly prevalent among Aborigines. The contemporary diets of Australian Aborigines are energy rich and contain high amounts of fat, refined carbohydrates, and salt; they are also poor in fiber and certain nutrients, including folate, retinol, and vitamin E and other vitamins. Risks of development of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes in this population probably develop during late childhood and adolescence. This indicates a need for greater emphasis on health promotion and disease prevention than at present and a need to plan these in culturally sensitive, secure, and appropriate ways. Most information about Aboriginal diets is anecdotal or semiquantitative. More effort needs to be invested in studies that more clearly and precisely define dietary patterns in Aboriginal people, especially children, and how these patterns influence their growth, nutritional status, and health, prospectively.

TI  - Decay and erosion-related transport of sulfur compounds in soils of rubber based agroforestry
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - Elemental sulfur is intensively used to control weeds and rubber leaf diseases. However, the mechanisms contributing to elemental sulfur dissipation and decay (hereafter decay) in rubber agroforestry remains unclear. This study relates hydrological processes such as runoff and soil loss to the changes in soil total sulfur (S-tot) and sulfate (S-SO4) in typical hillslope rubber agroforestry intercropped with cocoa in Xishuangbanna. The elemental sulfur decay kinetics were studied at two slopes (top and bottom) and three agrosystems (weed, no-weed and mixed). The results show that soil moisture and hydraulic conductivity was uniformly distributed in the experimental rubber agroforestry settings. Higher soil loss and runoff occurred in the bottom slope than the top slope, and in no-weed agrosystem than the herbaceous agrosystems (weed and mixed). The soil loss was mainly driven by runoff. Moreover, S-tot and S-SO4 in runoff water were higher in weed agrosystem than no-weed agrosystems. Soil S-tot best fit a two-compartments kinetics model, with lower kinetic rates in elemental sulfur applied treatments than in the no-added elemental sulfur treatments, particularly for the weed agrosystem. The soil S-tot dissipation time 50% (DT50) was 10-14 times higher in top slope than bottom slope; but 4 and 20 times higher in mixed and no-weed agrosystems, respectively, compared to the weed agrosystem. The soil S-tot and S-SO4 contents negatively correlated with soil microbial respiration (CO2 efflux), indicating an adverse influence of elemental sulfur on soil microbial activity. In short, elemental sulfur decay and its S-SO4 transformation depended on soil moisture, runoff, soil erosion and soil CO2, which are in turn affected by slope and agrosystem. This study not only clarifies the mechanisms of elemental sulfur dissipation and decay for its use as an environmental friendly agrochemical; but it also provides information to understand the contribution of runoff and soil loss on these mechanisms in rubber agroforestry.

TI  - Morphological, cultural and pathogenic characteristics of <i>Coniothyrium zuluense</i> isolates from different plantation regions in South Africa
T2  - MYCOPATHOLOGIA
AB  - Coniothyrium canker caused by Coniothyrium zuluense, is a serious stem canker disease of Eucalyptus species in sub-tropical regions of South Africa. This disease is typified by necrotic bark lesions that coalesce to form large kino-impregnated cankers along the stems of trees. The strategy currently used to manage Coniothyrium canker in plantations is to deploy Eucalyptus species or clones that are resistant to the disease. Considerable success has already been achieved in this regard, but the long-term durability of resistance is of concern. Thus, forest managers are interested in the genetic diversity of the pathogen and its potential to overcome disease resistance in planting stock. In this study, 344 isolates of C. zuluense from different plantation regions in South Africa were compared on the basis of colony colour, conidial morphology, growth characteristics on agar and pathogenicity to a susceptible E. grandis clone. Conidia of all C. zuluense isolates measured were similar in size and shape. The fungus is slow growing in culture, which is indicative of its apparent biotrophic habit, with optimum growth observed at 30degreesC. Isolates of C. zuluense displayed considerable variation in colony colour and pathogenicity in inoculation trials. Variation in morphology and pathogenicity amongst isolates suggests that C. zuluense has been present in South Africa for an extended period of time, or that it is changing rapidly due to strong directional selection pressures.

TI  - A novel negevirus isolated from <i>Aedes vexans</i> mosquitoes in Finland
T2  - ARCHIVES OF VIROLOGY
AB  - Negeviruses are insect-specific enveloped RNA viruses that have been detected in mosquitoes and sandflies from various geographical locations. Here, we describe a new negevirus from Northern Europe, isolated from pool ofAedes vexansmosquitoes collected in Finland, designated as Mekrijarvi negevirus (MEJNV). MEJNV had a typical negevirus genome organization, is 9,740 nucleotides in length, and has a GC content of 47.53%. The MEJNV genome contains three ORFs, each containing the following identified conserved domains: ORF1 (7,068 nt) encodes a viral methyltransferase, an FtsJ-like methyltransferase, a viral RNA helicase, and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, ORF2 (1,242 nt) encodes a putative virion glycoprotein, and ORF3 (660 nt) encodes a putative virion membrane protein. A distinctive feature relative to other currently known negeviruses is a 7-nucleotide-long overlap between ORF1 and ORF2. MEJNV shares the highest sequence identity with Ying Kou virus from China, with 67.71% nucleotide and 75.19% and 59.00% amino acid sequence identity in ORF 1 and ORF 2, respectively. ORF3 had the highest amino acid sequence similarity to Daeseongdong virus 1 and negevirus Nona 1, both with 77.61% identity, and to Ying Kou virus, with 71.22% identity. MEJNV is currently the northernmost negevirus described. Our report supports the view that negeviruses are a globally distributed, diverse group of viruses that can be found from mosquitoes in a wide range of terrestrial biomes from tropical to boreal forests.

TI  - Ocular involvement in systemic Loa-Loa filariasis. Case report and review of the literature
T2  - OPHTHALMOLOGE
AB  - Background. Within the last few years there is more and more evidence for nonspecific ocular symptoms caused by "exotic" pathogens. We herewith report another case of such an infection to underline the increasing importance and diagnostic relevance even of rare diseases.
   Patient. A 35-year-old female German patient presented with recurrent left retrobulbar "feeling of pressure" after a 6-month-stay in Central Africa 5 years ago. In addition, she reported on repeated swelling of the skin and joints of her hands and arms. Multiple ophthalmologic and rheumatologic investigations had been carried out without diagnostic results. Her ophthalmologist referred her with the presumed diagnosis of a subconjunctival worm.
   Results. Slit-lamp biomicroscopy confirmed the original suspicion, and after topical anesthesia a female Loa-Loa worm was easily removed with forceps through a conjunctival incision. The general examination showed symptoms of systemic infection (calabar swelling, eosinophilia). Classification and initiation of treatment with diethylcarbamazine and mebendazole were carried out by the University Institute of Parasitology.
   Conclusion. Loa-Loa is a parasitic infection endemic in the tropical rain forests of Western, Central, and Eastern Africa. It is transmitted by the Chrysops fly. An increasing number of oculosystemic infections in non-African patients with Loa-Loa are being published. Therefore, any patient with an unclassifiable eye affection should also be investigated for those rare pathogens.

TI  - Amazonian Biodiversity: A View of Drug Development for Leishmaniasis and Malaria
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE BRAZILIAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB  - Chemotherapy is the only validated therapy for the treatment for the neglected diseases leishmaniasis and malaria. However, the emergence of drug resistance, collateral effects and long-term treatment encourage the development of new and more efficient drugs. The Amazon tropical forest includes the richest areas of biodiversity in the world, including a great number of microbes, plant and animal species that produce a source of interesting biologically active molecules. Several of these molecules, obtained from plant extracts and frog venom have leishmanicidal and plasmodicidal activity, highlighting the potential of this biodiversity for the development of new drugs. In research, modern approaches in new drug development are carried out using combinatorial chemistry, high-throughput screening, bioinformatics, molecular interaction, crystallography and dynamic studies of cellular and systemic toxicity. In Brazil, these techniques are mainly present in only a few academic groups with no efficient connection to industry. The problem associated with over-regulation for accessing the biological material in restricted areas, local populations and indigenous areas places major barriers in the path of research and development of new drugs. Thus, the association of academic research groups in Brazil, encouraged and supported by government and industry, is essential to overcome these major barriers related to the development of new products for treatment of neglected diseases from Amazonian biodiversity in future years.

TI  - Impact of repeated annual community directed treatment with ivermectin on loiasis parasitological indicators in Cameroon: Implications for onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis elimination in areas co-endemic with <i>Loa loa</i> in Africa
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   Loiasis is a filarial infection endemic in the rainforest zone of west and central Africa particularly in Cameroon, Gabon, Republic of Congo, and Democratic Republic of the Congo. Repeated treatments with ivermectin have been delivered using the annual community directed treatment with ivermectin (CDTI) approach for several years to control onchocerciasis in some Loa loa-Onchocerca volvulus co-endemic areas. The impact of CDTI on loiasis parasitological indicators is not known. We, therefore, designed this cross sectional study to explore the effects of several rounds of CDTI on parasitological indicators of loiasis.
   Methodology/Principal findings
   The study was conducted in the East, Northwest and Southwest 2 CDTI projects of Cameroon. Individuals who consented to participate were interviewed for ivermectin treatment history and enrolled for parasitological screening using thick smears. Ivermectin treatment history was correlated with loiasis prevalence/intensity. A total of 3,684 individuals were recruited from 36 communities of the 3 CDTI projects and 900 individuals from 9 villages in a non-CDTI district. In the East, loiasis prevalence was 29.3% (range = 24.2%-34.6%) in the non-CDTI district but 16.0% (3.3%-26.6%) in the CDTI district with 10 ivermectin rounds (there were no baseline data for the latter). In the Northwest and Southwest 2 districts, reductions from 30.5% to 17.9% (after 9 ivermectin rounds) but from 8.1% to 7.8% (not significantly different after 14 rounds) were registered post CDTI, respectively. Similar trends in infection intensity were observed in all sites. There was a negative relationship between adherence to ivermectin treatment and prevalence/intensity of infection in all sites. None of the children (aged 10-14 years) examined in the East CDTI project harboured high (8,000-30,000 mf/ml) or very high (>30,000 mf/ml) microfilarial loads. Individuals who had taken >5 ivermectin treatments were 2.1 times more likely to present with no microfilaraemia than those with less treatments.
   Conclusion
   In areas where onchocerciasis and loiasis are co-endemic, CDTI reduces the number of, and microfilaraemia in L. ioa-infected individuals, and this, in turn, will help to prevent nonneurological and neurological complications post-ivermectin treatment among CDTI adherents.

TI  - Zoonoses As Ecological Entities: A Case Review of Plague
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - As a zoonosis, Plague is also an ecological entity, a complex system of ecological interactions between the pathogen, the hosts, and the spatiotemporal variations of its ecosystems. Five reservoir system models have been proposed: (i) assemblages of small mammals with different levels of susceptibility and roles in the maintenance and amplification of the cycle; (ii) species-specific chronic infection models; (ii) flea vectors as the true reservoirs; (iii) Telluric Plague, and (iv) a metapopulation arrangement for species with a discrete spatial organization, following a source-sink dynamic of extinction and recolonization with naive potential hosts. The diversity of the community that harbors the reservoir system affects the transmission cycle by predation, competition, and dilution effect. Plague has notable environmental constraints, depending on altitude (500+ meters), warm and dry climates, and conditions for high productivity events for expansion of the transmission cycle. Human impacts are altering Plague dynamics by altering landscape and the faunal composition of the foci and adjacent areas, usually increasing the presence and number of human cases and outbreaks. Climatic change is also affecting the range of its occurrence. In the current transitional state of zoonosis as a whole, Plague is at risk of becoming a public health problem in poor countries where ecosystem erosion, anthropic invasion of new areas, and climate change increase the contact of the population with reservoir systems, giving new urgency for ecologic research that further details its maintenance in the wild, the spillover events, and how it links to human cases.

TI  - Seroprevalence of Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania mexicana in Free-Ranging Howler Monkeys in Southeastern Mexico
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY
AB  - Natural infection of wild mammals by protozoa parasites is quite common in nature. For Neotropical Primates different infections of parasites that are etiological agent of disease in human have been identified. In particular, infections by Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania sp., have been reported for some New World primate species, but there are no reports of infection with these parasites in any primate species in Mexico. A serological study was conducted on two howler monkey species (Alouatta pigra and A. palliata) from the Mexican states of Campeche and Tabasco. A total of 55 serum samples (20 samples from A. pigra, 20 samples from A. palliata, and 15 samples from semifree ranging A. palliata of Los Tuxtlas, Veracruz as negative controls) were analyzed for the detection of immunoglobulin G antibodies against T. cruzi and Leishmania mexicana through enzyme linked immunosorbent assay test, indirect immunofluorescence assay and Western blot. The overall prevalence of antibodies in howler monkeys was 17.5% for T. cruzi and 30% for L. mexicana. Our results also indicate that A. pigra is more susceptible to develop leishmaniasis than A. palliata. Finally, the finding of positive serology in these primates should be given serious consideration for public health, given the potential role of these primate species as wild reservoirs for these diseases and the increasing contact of monkeys with human populations due to habitat loss and fragmentation.

TI  - Occurrence, distribution and health risk from polycyclic aromatic compounds (PAHs, oxygenated-PAHs and azaarenes) in street dust from a major West African Metropolis
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Scientific evidence suggests that the burden of disease on urban residents of sub-Saharan African Countries is increasing, partly as a result of exposure to elevated concentrations of toxic environmental chemicals. However, characterization of the levels, composition pattern and sources of polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs) in environmental samples from African cities is still lacking. This study measured the PAHs, oxygenated-PAHs (OPAHs) and azaarene (AZAs) content of street dusts collected from Kumasi, Ghana (a major metropolis located in the tropical forest zone of West Africa). The Sigma Alkyl + parent-PAHs, Sigma OPAHs and Sigma AZAs concentration in street dust averaged 2570 ng g(-1) (range: 181-7600 ng g-1), 833 ng g-1 (57-4200 ng g-1) and 73 ng g-1 (3.3240 ng g-1), respectively. The concentrations of Sigma Alkyl+ parent-PAHs were strongly correlated (n = 25) with SOPAHs (r = 0.96, p < 0.01) and Sigma AZAs (r = 0.94, p < 0.01). The Sigma OPAHs concentrations were also strongly correlated with Sigma AZAs (r = 0.91, p < 0.01). Concentrations of individual PAHs in these street dusts were enriched at between 12 and 836 compared to their average concentrations in background soils from same city, demonstrating the high influence of traffic emissions. Several individual OPAHs and AZAs had higher concentrations than their related and often monitored parent-PAHs. The estimated incremental lifetime cancer risks due to the parent-PAHs in street dusts was >10(-6) indicating high risk of contracting cancer from exposure to street dust from Kumasi. The contribution of OPAHs, AZAs, and alkyl-PAHs in street dust to cancer risk could not be quantified because of lack of toxicity equivalency factors for these compounds; however this could be significant because of their high concentration and known higher toxicity of some polar PACs and alkyl-PAHs than their related parent-PAHs.

TI  - Increased Human Incidence of West Nile Virus Disease near Rice Fields in California but Not in Southern United States
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Anthropogenic land use change, including agriculture, can alter mosquito larval habitat quality, increase mosquito abundance, and increase incidence of vector-borne disease. Rice is a staple food crop for more than half of the world's population, with similar to 1% of global production occurring within the United States (US). Flooded rice fields provide enormous areas of larval habitat for mosquito species and may be hotspots for mosquito-borne pathogens, including West Nile virus (WNV). West Nile virus was introduced into the Americas in 1999 and causes yearly epidemics in the US with an average of approximately 1,400 neuroinvasive cases and 130 deaths per year. We examined correlations between rice cultivation and WNV disease incidence in rice-growing regions within the US. Incidence of WNV disease increased with the fraction of each county under rice cultivation in California but not in the southern US. We show that this is likely due to regional variation in the mosquitoes transmitting WNV. Culex tarsalis was an important vector of WNV in California, and its abundance increased with rice cultivation, whereas in rice-growing areas of the southern US, the dominant WNV vector was Culex quinquefasciatus, which rarely breeds in rice fields. These results illustrate how cultivation of particular crops can increase disease risk and how spatial variation in vector ecology can alter the relationship between land cover and disease.

TI  - Cacao diseases - The trilogy revisited
T2  - PHYTOPATHOLOGY
CP  - Annual Meeting of the American-Phytopathological-Society Joint with the Canadian-Phytopathological-Society/Mycological-Society-of-America
AB  - This paper reviews the significant advances by the diseases themselves, as well as by the scientists, in the intervening period since the disease trilogy was first delimited in 1989. The impact of these diseases, black pod, witches' broom, and frosty pod rot, has increased dramatically. In addition, there have been radical changes in the taxonomic profiles of these pathogens, which have been based on both traditional (morphological, cytological) and modern (molecular) approaches. Black pod is caused by a complex of Phytophthora species, in which P palmivora still is the most important worldwide. However, recent invasion of the principal cacao-growing countries of West Africa by the more virulent P megakarya has been cause for concern. The latter evolved in the ancient forests straddling the Cameroon-Nigerian border as a primary coloniser of fallen fruit. Conversely, frosty pod rot, caused by Moniliophthora roreri, and witches' broom, caused by M. (Crinipellis) perniciosa, both neotropical diseases, are hemibiotrophic, coevolved pathogens. Respectively, M. roreri arose on Theobroma gileri in submontane forests on the north-western slopes of the Andes, whereas M. perniciosa developed as a complex of pathotypes with a considerably wider geographic and host range within South America; the cacao pathotype evolved on that host in the Amazon basin. The inter-relationships of these vicariant species and their recent spread are discussed, together with control strategies.

TI  - Diagnostics for schistosomiasis in Africa and Arabia: a review of present options in control and future needs for elimination
T2  - PARASITOLOGY
AB  - Within the World Health Organization 2012-2020 roadmap for control and elimination of schistosomiasis, the scale-up of mass drug administration with praziquantel is set to change the epidemiological landscape across Africa and Arabia. Central in measuring progress is renewed emphasis upon diagnostics which operate at individual, community and environmental levels by assessing reductions in disease, infections and parasite transmission. However, a fundamental tension is revealed between levels for present diagnostic tools, and methods applied in control settings are not necessarily adequate for application in elimination scenarios. Indeed navigating the transition from control to elimination needs careful consideration and planning. In the present context of control, we review current options for diagnosis of schistosomiasis at different levels, highlighting several strengths and weaknesses therein. Future challenges in elimination are raised and we propose that more cost-effective diagnostics and clinical staging algorithms are needed. Using the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia as a contemporary example, embedding new diagnostic methods within the primary care health system is discussed with reference to both urogenital and intestinal schistosomiasis.

TI  - Epidemiology of Concomitant Infection Due to <i>Loa loa</i> and <i>Mansonella perstans</i> in Gabon
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background: The filarial parasites Loa loa and Mansonnella perstans are endemic in the central and western African forest block. Loa loa is pathogenic and represents a major obstacle to the control of co-endemic filariae because its treatment can cause fatal complications such as encephalitis.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: 4392 individuals aged over 15 years were studied both by direct examination and a concentration technique. The overall prevalence rates were 22.4% for Loa loa microfilaremia, 10.2% for M. perstans microfilaremia, and 3.2% for mixed infection. The prevalence of both filariae was higher in the forest ecosystem than in savannah and lakeland (p<0.0001). The intensity of microfilariae (mf) was also higher in the forest ecosystem for both parasites. The prevalence and intensity of microfilaria were both influenced by age and gender. Correlations were found between the prevalence and intensity of Loa loa microfilariae (r = 0.215 p = 0.036), and between the prevalence of Loa loa and the prevalence of individuals with microfilaria >8000 mf/ml (r = 0.624; p<0.0001) and microfilariae >30 000 mf/ml (r = 0.319, p = 0.002). In contrast, the prevalence of pruritis and Calabar swellings correlated negatively with the prevalence of Loa loa microfilaria (r = -0.219, p = 0.032; r = -0.220; p = 0.031, respectively). Pruritis, Calabar swellings and eye worm were not associated with L. loa mf intensity (r = -0.144, p = 0.162; r-0.061, p = 0.558; and r = 0.051, p = 0.624, respectively), or with the prevalence or intensity of M. perstans microfilariae.
   Conclusions/Significance: This map of the distribution of filariae in Gabon should prove helpful for control programs. Our findings confirm the spatial uniformity of the relationship between parasitological indices. Clinical manifestations point to a relationship between filariae and allergy.

TI  - Reemergence of yellow fever virus in southeastern Brazil, 2017-2018: What sparked the spread?
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   The 2017-2018 yellow fever virus (YFV) outbreak in southeastern Brazil marked a reemergence of YFV in urban states that had been YFV-free for nearly a century. Unlike earlier urban YFV transmission, this epidemic was driven by forest mosquitoes. The objective of this study was to evaluate environmental drivers of this outbreak.
   Methodology/Principal findings
   Using surveillance data from the Brazilian Ministry of Health on human and non-human primate (NHP) cases of YFV, we traced the spatiotemporal progression of the outbreak. We then assessed the epidemic timing in relation to drought using a monthly Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) and evaluated demographic risk factors for rural or outdoor exposure amongst YFV cases. Finally, we developed a mechanistic framework to map the relationship between drought and YFV. Both human and NHP cases were first identified in a hot, dry, rural area in northern Minas Gerais before spreading southeast into the more cool, wet urban states. Outbreaks coincided with drought in all four southeastern states of Brazil and an extreme drought in Minas Gerais. Confirmed YFV cases had an increased odds of being male (OR 2.6; 95% CI 2.2-3.0), working age (OR: 1.8; 95% CI: 1.5-2.1), and reporting any recent travel (OR: 2.8; 95% CI: 2.3-3.3). Based on this data as well as mosquito and non-human primate biology, we created the "Mono-DrY" mechanistic framework showing how an unusual drought in this region could have amplified YFV transmission at the rural-urban interface and sparked the spread of this epidemic.
   Conclusions/Significance
   The 2017-2018 YFV epidemic in Brazil originated in hot, dry rural areas of Minas Gerais before expanding south into urban centers. An unusually severe drought in this region may have created environmental pressures that sparked the reemergence of YFV in Brazil's southeastern cities.
   Author summary
   In 2017-2018, cities in southeastern Brazil experienced an unusual outbreak of yellow fever virus. In the early 20(th) century, these cities had large outbreaks of yellow fever, spread by Aedes mosquitoes. But until this recent outbreak, they had been free of yellow fever for nearly a century. While this outbreak was spread by Haemagogus forest mosquitoes, the reemergence of yellow fever in densely populated urban areas raises serious concerns about it reestablishing ongoing transmission in cities, spread by urban Aedes mosquitoes. Our study sought to understand how and why yellow fever virus remerged in this area. We traced the outbreak, finding that it started in hot, dry, rural areas and spread south into cool, wet urban areas. The epidemic coincided with a severe drought, particularly in Minas Gerais where the epidemic started. Individuals with outdoor or rural risk factors were at highest risk, especially when the epidemic started. Therefore, this severe drought may have promoted the spread of yellow fever at rural-urban boundaries. To further explore this idea, we developed a unique framework based on forest mosquito and Howler monkey biology. Our framework, "Mono-DrY," shows how severe drought could have increased mosquito and monkey densities, promoting the spread of yellow fever.

TI  - Emergence of dengue in the tribal pockets of Nilgiris district, Tamil Nadu
T2  - TROPICAL DOCTOR
AB  - As original tribal ways of living have morphed from a forest dweller existence, dengue is no longer an urban infection but is now also found in rural hilly areas. The spread of dengue is enhanced by the frequent movement of people to endemic areas where there is a vector mosquito presence. The impact of the virus is known to be great in the immunologically naive population. Our study reports on the threat of the dengue virus in these hilly areas.

TI  - <i>Ganoderma</i> and <i>Amauroderma</i> species associated with root-rot disease of <i>Acacia</i> <i>mangium</i> plantation trees in Indonesia and Malaysia
T2  - AUSTRALASIAN PLANT PATHOLOGY
CP  - 5th Australasian Soilborne Diseases Symposium
AB  - Fungal sporocarps and cultures associated with signs and symptoms of root-rot disease were collected from Acacia mangium and other tropical hardwood species. The collections were identified by either morphological characters and/or by phylogenetic analysis based on DNA sequences as Ganoderma philippii, G. mastoporum, G. aff. steyaertanum, G. australe and Amauroderma rugosum. Phylogenetic analysis unequivocally placed in the G. philippii clade four sequences amplified from A. mangium root and butt tissue showing clear signs of red root-rot disease (roots are covered by a red rhizomorphic skin). Whereas G. philippii was the most frequently encountered fungal species in A. mangium with red root-rot disease, this study indicates that other fungal species related to G. mastoporum may cause root-rot disease with very similar symptoms. An isolate (FRIM 138) that had caused red root-rot disease in artificial inoculations carried out before this study and was presumed to be G. philippii, is here determined to be closely related to G. mastoporum, G. cupreum and G. sinense. A Ganoderma species associated with a yellow-brown root-rot disease killing trees in an A. mangium plantation in Central Java, previously identified as G. lucidum, is shown by phylogenetic analysis to be closely related to G. steyaertanum, though some morphological characters vary from the original description of that species.

TI  - Safety and pharmacokinetics of single doses of (+)-calanolide A, a novel, naturally occurring nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, in healthy, human immunodeficiency virus-negative human subjects
T2  - ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS AND CHEMOTHERAPY
AB  - (+)-Calanolide A is a novel, naturally occurring, nonnucleoside inhibitor of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase first isolated from a tropical tree (Calophyllum lanigerum) in the Malaysian rain forest. Previous studies have demonstrated that (+)-calanolide A has specific activity against the reverse transcriptase of HIV-1 and a favorable safety profile in animals, In addition, (+)-calanolide A exhibits a unique HIV-1 resistance profile in vitro. The safety and pharmacokinetics of (+)-calanolide A was examined in four successive single-dose cohorts (200, 400, 600, and 800 mg) in healthy, HIV-negative volunteers. In this initial phase I study, the toxicity of (+)-calanolide A was minimal in the 47 subjects treated. Dizziness, taste perversion, headache, eructation, and nausea were the most frequently reported adverse events. These events were not all judged to be related to study medication nor were they dose related. While 51% of subjects reported mild and transient dizziness, in many cases this appeared to be temporally related to phlebotomy. Calculation of the terminal-phase half-life (t(1/2)) was precluded by intrasubject variability in the 200-, 400-, and 600-mg dose cohorts but was approximately 20 h for the 800-mg dose group. (+)-Calanolide A was rapidly absorbed following administration, with time to maximum concentration of drug in plasma (T,,,) values occurring between 2.4 and 5.2 h postdosing depending on the dose. Plasma levels of (+)-calanolide A at all dosing levels were quite variable; however, both the mean concentration in plasma (C,,,), and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve increased proportionately in relation to the dose. Although raw plasma drug levels were higher in women than in men, when doses were normalized for body mass, the pharmacokinetic profiles were virtually identical with those observed for males. In general, levels of (+)-calanolide A in human plasma were higher than would have been predicted from animal studies, yet the safety profile remained benign. In conclusion, this study demonstrated the safety and favorable pharmacokinetic profile of single doses of (+)-calanolide A in healthy, HIV-negative individuals.

TI  - A macroecological perspective on strategic bat conservation in the US National Park Service
T2  - ECOSPHERE
AB  - North American bat populations face unprecedented threats from disease and rapid environmental change, requiring a commensurate strategic conservation response. Protected-area networks have tremendous potential to support coordinated resource protection, disease surveillance, and population monitoring that could become a cornerstone of 21st-century bat conservation. To motivate this idea, we develop a macroecological perspective about bat diversity and associated conservation challenges and opportunities on U.S. National Park Service (NPS) lands. We compared occurrence records from parks against published range maps. Only 55 (19%) of parks reported as present >= 90% of the bat species expected based on range maps, highlighting the information-gap challenge. Discrepancies suggest substantial under-reporting and under-sampling of bats on NPS lands; inadequate range maps and habitat specificity are implicated for some species. Despite these discrepancies, 50 species, including several range-restricted and endangered taxa, were reported in at least one park unit, including those in the Caribbean and tropical Pacific. Species richness increased with park area at a rate (z) of similar to 0.1, a pattern confounded by covariation with latitude, elevation, and habitat. When accounting for these factors, richness decreased predictably at higher latitudes and increased at mid-elevations and with greater numbers of keystone underground habitat structures (caves and mines), reflecting a strong species-energy relationship. The inclusion of covariates that represented percentage of natural vs. human-modified (converted) landscapes and elevation range-a proxy for environmental heterogeneity-was uninformative. White-nose syndrome (WNS) presents a tremendous challenge to the NPS: All 12 species currently known to be affected by the disease or to host the causal fungus are represented in the NPS system. One hundred and twenty-seven NPS parks are in counties currently or likely to become WNS-positive by 2026. All parks are expected to experience increasing temperatures in coming decades; forecasted climate change velocity is particularly high (>1 SD) for 50 parks. Seventeen parks are in the vicinity of high (>1 SD) wind turbine density. Based on these biogeographic patterns, we suggest ways to prioritize NPS parks for additional inventories, monitoring, and resource protection. Our results demonstrate how macroecology and bioinformatics together can guide strategic conservation capacity-building among protected areas.

TI  - Characterizing Types of Human Mobility to Inform Differential and Targeted Malaria Elimination Strategies in Northeast Cambodia
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Human population movements currently challenge malaria elimination in low transmission foci in the Greater Mekong Subregion. Using a mixed-methods design, combining ethnography (n = 410 interviews), malariometric data (n = 4996) and population surveys (n = 824 indigenous populations; n = 704 Khmer migrants) malaria vulnerability among different types of mobile populations was researched in the remote province of Ratanakiri, Cambodia. Different structural types of human mobility were identified, showing differential risk and vulnerability. Among local indigenous populations, access to malaria testing and treatment through the VMW-system and LLIN coverage was high but control strategies failed to account for forest farmers' prolonged stays at forest farms/fields (61% during rainy season), increasing their exposure (p = 0.002). The Khmer migrants, with low acquired immunity, active on plantations and mines, represented a fundamentally different group not reached by LLIN-distribution campaigns since they were largely unregistered (79%) and unaware of the local VMW-system (95%) due to poor social integration. Khmer migrants therefore require control strategies including active detection, registration and immediate access to malaria prevention and control tools from which they are currently excluded. In conclusion, different types of mobility require different malaria elimination strategies. Targeting mobility without an in-depth understanding of malaria risk in each group challenges further progress towards elimination.

TI  - BRAZILIAN MOSQUITO (DIPTERA: CULICIDAE) FAUNA. I. <i>Anopheles</i> SPECIES FROM PORTO VELHO, RONDONIA STATE, WESTERN AMAZON, BRAZIL
T2  - REVISTA DO INSTITUTO DE MEDICINA TROPICAL DE SAO PAULO
AB  - This study contributes to knowledge of Anopheles species, including vectors of Plasmodium from the western Brazilian Amazon in Porto Velho, Rondonia State. The sampling area has undergone substantial environmental changes as a consequence of agricultural and hydroelectric projects, which have caused intensive deforestation and favored habitats for some mosquito species. The purpose of this study was to diagnose the occurrence of anopheline species from collections in three locations along an electric-power transmission line. Each locality was sampled three times from 2010 to 2011. The principal adult mosquitoes captured in Shannon trap were Anopheles darlingi, An. triannulatus, An. nuneztovari l.s., An. gilesi and An. costai. In addition, larvae were collected in ground breeding sites for Anopheles braziliensis, An. triannulatus, An. darlingi, An. deaneorum, An. marajoara, An. peryassui, An. nuneztovari l.s. and An. oswaldoi-konderi. Anopheles darlingi was the most common mosquito in the region. We discuss Culicidae systematics, fauna distribution, and aspects of malaria in altered habitats of the western Amazon.

TI  - Rift Valley Fever Virus Seroprevalence in Human Rural Populations of Gabon
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background: Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a mosquito-borne viral zoonosis caused by a phlebovirus and transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Humans can also be infected through direct contact with blood (aerosols) or tissues (placenta, stillborn) of infected animals. Although severe clinical cases can be observed, infection with RVF virus (RVFV) in humans is, in most cases, asymptomatic or causes a febrile illness without serious symptoms. In small ruminants RVFV mainly causes abortion and neonatal death. The distribution of RVFV has been well documented in many African countries, particularly in the north (Egypt, Sudan), east (Kenya, Tanzania, Somalia), west (Senegal, Mauritania) and south (South Africa), but also in the Indian Ocean (Madagascar, Mayotte) and the Arabian Peninsula. In contrast, the prevalence of RVFV has rarely been investigated in central African countries.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We therefore conducted a large serological survey of rural populations in Gabon, involving 4,323 individuals from 212 randomly selected villages (10.3% of all Gabonese villages). RVFV-specific IgG was found in a total of 145 individuals (3.3%) suggesting the wide circulation of Rift Valley fever virus in Gabon. The seroprevalence was significantly higher in the lakes region than in forest and savannas zones, with respective rates of 8.3%, 2.9% and 2.2%. In the lakes region, RVFV-specific IgG was significantly more prevalent in males than in females (respectively 12.8% and 3.8%) and the seroprevalence increased gradually with age in males but not in females.
   Conclusions/Significance: Although RVFV was suggested to circulate at a relatively high level in Gabon, no outbreaks or even isolated cases have been documented in the country. The higher prevalence in the lakes region is likely to be driven by specific ecologic conditions favorable to certain mosquito vector species. Males may be more at risk of infection than females because they spend more time farming and hunting outside the villages, where they may be more exposed to mosquito bites and infected animals. Further investigations are needed to determine the putative sylvan cycle of RVFV, including the mosquito species and the reservoir role of wild animals in the viral maintenance cycle.

TI  - Bayesian Spatiotemporal Pattern and Eco-climatological Drivers of Striped Skunk Rabies in the North Central Plains
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Striped skunks are one of the most important terrestrial reservoirs of rabies virus in North America, and yet the prevalence of rabies among this host is only passively monitored and the disease among this host remains largely unmanaged. Oral vaccination campaigns have not efficiently targeted striped skunks, while periodic spillovers of striped skunk variant viruses to other animals, including some domestic animals, are routinely recorded. In this study we evaluated the spatial and spatio-temporal patterns of infection status among striped skunk cases submitted for rabies testing in the North Central Plains of US in a Bayesian hierarchical framework, and also evaluated potential eco-climatological drivers of such patterns. Two Bayesian hierarchical models were fitted to point-referenced striped skunk rabies cases [n = 656 (negative), and n = 310 (positive)] received at a leading rabies diagnostic facility between the years 2007-2013. The first model included only spatial and temporal terms and a second covariate model included additional covariates representing eco-climatic conditions within a 4km(2) home-range area for striped skunks. The better performing covariate model indicated the presence of significant spatial and temporal trends in the dataset and identified higher amounts of land covered by low-intensity developed areas [Odds ratio (OR) = 3.41; 95% Bayesian Credible Intervals (CrI) = 2.08, 3.85], higher level of patch fragmentation (OR = 1.70; 95% CrI = 1.25, 2.89), and diurnal temperature range (OR = 0.54; 95% CrI = 0.27, 0.91) to be important drivers of striped skunk rabies incidence in the study area. Model validation statistics indicated satisfactory performance for both models; however, the covariate model fared better. The findings of this study are important in the context of rabies management among striped skunks in North America, and the relevance of physical and climatological factors as risk factors for skunk to human rabies transmission and the space-time patterns of striped skunk rabies are discussed.

TI  - Altitude is the main driver of coffee leaf rust epidemics: a large-scale survey in Ethiopia
T2  - TROPICAL PLANT PATHOLOGY
AB  - Arabica coffee (Coffea arabicaL.) is a native from Africa, particularly from Ethiopia. Previously of little concern to Ethiopian farmers, coffee leaf rust (CLR), caused by the fungusHemileia vastatrix, is an emergent disease globally. To update the status of CLR, a large survey was conducted in 405 coffee fields across nine production zones of Oromia and Southern Nations Nationalities and Peoples (SNNP) regions. The disease, evaluated one time during the month of the peak for CLR intensity for each region, was present in every single field; mean incidence and severity ranged from 5 to 86.7% (mean = 35.3%) and 0.22 to 55.5 (mean = 9.09), respectively. A complimentary log-log model was developed to predict mean field severity from mean field incidence. Altitude, a known surrogate variable for temperature, was the main driver of the epidemics. Incidence and severity were highest at the lowland fields, where poorly managed plantations of local varieties grown under open sun were also more dominant. CLR intensity decreased with the increase in altitude at the highlands where well-managed and improved varieties grown under the shade in forest systems dominate the scenario. Our results contribute to increase awareness of a growing problem threatening coffee fields that are still under lower risk, such as at the highlands, particularly if temperatures rise and farmers cut forest to grow plantations of susceptible cultivars. Improving genetic resistance and adoption of best management practices are urgent to prevent the rapid surge of new races and mitigate crop losses currently overlooked by coffee farmers at the lowlands.

TI  - Infestation and distribution of chigger mites on Brown rat (<i>Rattus</i> <i>norvegicus</i>) in Yunnan Province, Southwest China
T2  - TROPICAL BIOMEDICINE
AB  - Chigger mites is a group of arthropods and some of them are vectors of scrub typhus. As a common synanthropic rodent species, the Brown rat ( Rattus norvegicus) often harbors lots of ectoparasites including chigger mites. According to some "data mining" strategies, the present study took the advantage of the abundant original data from a long-term field ecological investigation between 2001 and 2015 to make a detailed analysis of chigger mites on R. norvegicus in Yunnan Province, Southwest of China. From 18 of 33 investigated counties, only 1414 chigger mites were collected from 1113 Brown rats with relatively low infestations. The 1414 individual chigger mites were identified as comprising 61 species, 11 genera and 2 subfamilies of the family Trombiculidae with a high species diversity (S=61, H'=3.13). Of 61 mite species, there were four main species, Walchia ewingi, Ascoschoengastia indica, W. koi and A. rattinorvegici, which accounted for 44.41% of the total mites. All the chigger mites were of aggregated distribution among different individuals of R. norvegicus. The Brown rats in the outdoor habitats harbored much more individuals and species of chigger mites with a higher mean abundance (MA=1.46) and mean intensity (MI=12.53) than in the indoor habitats (P<0.05). The overall infestation of the rats was significantly higher in the mountainous landscapes than in the flatland landscapes (P<0.001). The species similarity (C-ss) of the mites on the male and female rats reached 64.44% with sex biased infestations. The male rats harbored more species and individuals of the mites than the female rats. The adult rats harbored more species and individuals of the mites than the juvenile rats. The species abundance distribution of the mites was successfully fitted by Preston's lognormal model with S(R)=15e(-[0.31(R-1)]2) (alpha=0.31, R-2=0.95). On the basis of fitting the theoretical curve by Preston's model, the total mite species on R. norvegicus was estimated to be 86 species, and 25 rare mite species were missed in the sampling field investigation. The curve tendency of the species-plot relationship indicates that R. norvegicus have a great potential to harbor many species of chigger mites, and more species of the mites would be collected if more rats are sampled.

TI  - Genetic characterization of a new entomo-pathogenic nematode (Tylenchida: Allantonematidae) parasite in wild-caught sandflies (Diptera: Psychodidae) from Western Ghats, India
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TROPICAL INSECT SCIENCE
AB  - Sandflies (Diptera: Psychodidae) are medically important insects prevalent in tropical and temperate regions of the world. About 30 species of these flies have been recorded from the Western Ghats region of Kerala. While carrying out epidemiological investigations on Leishmaniasis in this region, we found two species of field-collected sandflies viz., Phlebotomus argentipes and Sergentomyia monticola infected with Tylenchid nematode parasites. The infection rates were 0.89% and 0.9%, respectively. The parasite density of nematode juvenile stages was more than 1000 in all the specimens. Both males and females were found infected. We performed molecular characterization of these nematode parasites using multiple genetic markers, mitochondrial COI, and two different regions of 18S rDNA. The genetic analysis revealed that the nematode belonged to the genus Howardula of family Allantonematidae, one infesting P. argentipes (major vector species of Leishmania) and the other, S. monticola. This is the first report of natural infection with the entomo-parasitic nematode species, belonging to Allantonematidae among these sandfly species from India. Genetically related and unclassified species of nematodes belonging to this family had been reported elsewhere from termite species. As larval stages of sandflies develop in the organic matter of termite mounds, this finding may have significant implications on their bionomics and control.
