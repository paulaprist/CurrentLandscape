TI  - Pneumonia and bacteremia in a golden-headed lion tamarin (<i>Leontopithecus chrysomelas</i>) caused by <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> subsp <i>pneumoniae</i> during a translocation program of free-ranging animals in Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF VETERINARY DIAGNOSTIC INVESTIGATION
AB  - Klebsiella pneumoniae is an important emerging pathogen in humans, particularly the invasive hypermucoviscosity (HMV) phenotype. In addition, the organism is an important public health concern because of nosocomial infections and antimicrobial resistance. Nonhuman primates in captivity are susceptible to Klebsiella, particularly when a stress factor is involved. Infections vary depending on the species but can cause significant morbidity and mortality in these animals. The objective of this study was to describe a case of bronchopneumonia and bacteremia caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae in a free-ranging golden-headed lion tamarin (Leontopithecus chrysomelas) caught and maintained in quarantine during a translocation program for conservation purposes. An adult male, that had showed emaciation and apathy, was clinically examined and, despite being provided supportive therapy, died 2 days after onset of clinical signs. At postmortem examination, generalized bilateral pneumonia and pericarditis were observed. Tissue samples were fixed in 10% formalin for histology, and pulmonary tissues and cardiac blood were collected for microbiologic diagnostic procedures. Bacteria that were shown to be HMV K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae strains were isolated from the pulmonary fluids and cardiac blood in pure cultures. Severe bronchopneumonia was the main pathological finding. The consequences of the confirmed presence of the HMV phenotype of K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae in this wildlife species for human, animal, and ecosystem health should be determined. These results demonstrate the importance of quarantine and potential pathogen screening during wildlife translocation procedures.

TI  - A NEW <i>HAEMOPROTEUS</i> SPECIES (HAEMOSPORIDA: HAEMOPROTEIDAE) FROM THE ENDEMIC GALAPAGOS DOVE <i>ZENAIDA GALAPAGOENSIS</i>, WITH REMARKS ON THE PARASITE DISTRIBUTION, VECTORS, AND MOLECULAR DIAGNOSTICS
T2  - JOURNAL OF PARASITOLOGY
AB  - Haemoproteus (Haemoproteus) multipigmentatus n. sp. (Haemosporida, Haemoproteidae) was found in the endemic Galapagos dove Zenaida galapagoensis. It is described based on the morphology of its blood stages and segments of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene, which can be used for molecular identification and diagnosis of this species. Haemoproteus multipigmentatus can be readily distinguished from all species of hemoproteids of the subgenus Haemoproteus, primarily due to numerous (approximately 40 on average) small pigment granules in its mature gametocytes. Illustrations of blood stages of the new species are given, and phylogenetic analysis identifies DNA lineages closely related to this parasite, which is prevalent in the Galapagos dove and also has been recorded in other species of Columbiformes in Mexico, Guatemala, and Peru, and so seems to be widespread in countries in the New World with warm climates. Cytochrome b lineages of H. multipigmentatus cluster with hippoboscid-transmitted lineages of Haemoproteus columbae. The same lineages of H. multipigmentatus were recorded in thoraxes of the hippoboscid fly Microlynchia galapagoensis, which likely is a natural vector of this parasite in Galapagos. Because different primers might amplify different parasites if they have a better match during a simultaneous infection, it is important that researchers standardize the genetic marker of choice for molecular typing of hemosporidian species. This study shows that more discussion among researchers is needed to clearly establish the sequence length and number of genes used for identification of hemosporidian parasites at different taxonomic levels. We point to the need of using both morphology and gene markers in studies of hemosporidian parasites, particularly in wildlife.

TI  - BIOMEDICAL EVALUATION OF VERREAUX'S SIFAKA (<i>PROPITHECUS VERREAUXI</i>) FROM KIRINDY MITEA NATIONAL PARK IN MADAGASCAR
T2  - JOURNAL OF ZOO AND WILDLIFE MEDICINE
AB  - Evaluation of the health, prevalence, and incidence of diseases in wild populations is a critical component of wildlife management. In addition, the establishment of reference physiologic parameters can contribute to the assessment of population risks. Complete medical evaluations were performed on 33 wild Verreaux's sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi) from Kirindy Mitea National Park, Madagascar, during two field captures in June 2010 and June 2011. Each animal received a complete physical examination: weight, body temperature, heart rate, and respiratory rate were recorded, and ectoparasites collected. Blood samples were collected for complete blood cell count, differential white blood cell count, hemoparasite examination, serum biochemical profile, fat-soluble vitamin analysis, trace mineral analysis, and toxoplasmosis and viral serology. Fecal samples were collected for bacterial culture and endoparasite examination. Significant differences exist between age classes for neutrophil and lymphocyte count, alkaline phosphatase, and creatinine values. Parasites detected were Callistoura sp., Bertiella lemuriformis, and Dipetalonema petteri. This publication reports the first complete biomedical evaluation of the P. verreauxi and provides a basis for hematologic and biochemical comparisons of P. verreauxi in the wild.

TI  - Effects of Depression, Anxiety, Stigma, and Disclosure on Health-Related Quality of Life among Chronic Hepatitis B Patients in Dalian, China
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major public health problem in China. We evaluated the impact of psychosocial factors (stigma, disclosure, depression, and anxiety) on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among people living with chronic HBV infection (CHB) in the city of Dalian, Liaoning Province, China. In this hospital-based cross-sectional study, 401 patients living with chronic HBV infection were enrolled as study participants. Study measures included the Beck depression and anxiety inventory, the WHO Quality of Life (WHOQOL-BREF) assessment, the Toronto Chinese HBV Stigma Scale, and disclosure of HBV status to sexual partners. The primary outcome was HRQoL score as measured by the WHOQOL-BREF. A linear regression model was used to examine the association between HRQoL and the potential risk factors including stigma, disclosure, depression, anxiety, and sociodemographic variables. Stigma, disclosure, depression, and anxiety were the covariates of interest. A majority of the participants were females (n = 251, 65.6%), married (81.6%), and had a college or higher degree (32.4%). Depression, anxiety, stigma, and disclosure of HBV infection were associated with low HRQoL in all four domains of the WHOQOL-BREF (physical, psychological, social, and environmental domains) (P < 0.05), when all psychological factors were included in the model separately. Depression was found to be independently associated with low HRQoL in people living with HBV, when all psychological factors were included in the model simultaneously (P < 0.0001). Our data indicate the urgent need for healthcare providers (HCPs) and policy-makers to implement psychological interventions to improve HRQoL among people living with CHB.

TI  - Simulation of crop growth and energy and carbon dioxide fluxes at different time steps from hourly to daily
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
AB  - Understanding the exchange processes of energy and carbon dioxide (CO2) in the soil-vegetation -atmosphere system is important for assessing the role of the terrestrial ecosystem in the global water and carbon cycle and in climate change. We present a soil- vegetation -atmosphere integrated model (ChinaAgrosys) for simulating energy, water and CO, fluxes, crop growth and development, with ample supply of nutrients and in the absence of pests, diseases and weed damage. Furthermore, we test the hypotheses of whether there is any significant difference between simulations over different time steps. CO2, 41 water and heat fluxes were estimated by the improving parameterization method of the coupled photosynthesis- stomatal conductance -transpiration model. Soil water evaporation and plant transpiration were calculated using a multilayer water and heat-transfer model. Field experiments were conducted in the Yucheng Integrated Agricultural Experimental Station on the North China Plain. Daily weather and crop growth variables were observed during 1998-2001, and hourly weather variables and water and heat fluxes were measured using the eddy covariance method during 2002-2003. The results showed that the model could effectively simulate diurnal and seasonal changes of net radiation, sensible and latent heat flux, soil heat flux and CO2 fluxes. The processes of evapotranspiration, soil temperature and leaf area index agree well with the measured values. Midday depression of canopy photosynthesis could be simulated by assessing the diurnal change in canopy water potential. Moreover, the comparisons of simulated daily evapotranspiration and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) under different time steps indicated that time steps used by a model affect the simulated results. There is no significant difference between simulated evapotranspiration using the model under different time steps. However, simulated NEE produces large differences in the response to different time steps. Therefore, the accurate calculation of average absorbed photosynthetic active radiation is important for the scaling of the model from hourly steps to daily steps in simulating energy and CO, flux exchanges between winter wheat and the atmosphere.

TI  - Fungal Systematics and Evolution: FUSE 6
T2  - SYDOWIA
AB  - Fungal Systematics and Evolution (FUSE) is one of the journal series to address the "fusion" between morphological data and molecular phylogenetic data and to describe new fungal taxa and interesting observations. This paper is the 6th contribution in the FUSE series-presenting one new genus, twelve new species, twelve new country records, and three new combinations. The new genus is: Pseudozeugandromyces (Laboulbeniomycetes, Laboulbeniales). The new species are: Albatrellopsis flettioides from Pakistan, Aureoboletus garciae from Mexico, Entoloma canadense from Canada, E. frigidum from Sweden, E. porphyroleucum from Vietnam, Erythrophylloporus flammans from Vietnam, Marasmiellus boreoorientalis from Kamchatka Peninsula in the Russian Far East, Marasmiellus longistipes from Pakistan, Pseudozeugandromyces tachypori on Tachyporus pusillus (Coleoptera, Staphylinidae) from Belgium, Robillarda sohagensis from Egypt, Trechispora hondurensis from Honduras, and Tricholoma kenanii from Turkey. The new records are: Arthrorhynchus eucampsipodae on Eucampsipoda africanum (Diptera, Nycteribiidae) from Rwanda and South Africa, and on Nycteribia vexata (Diptera, Nycteribiidae) from Bulgaria; A. nycteribiae on Eucampsipoda africanum from South Africa, on Penicillidia conspicua (Diptera, Nycteribiidae) from Bulgaria (the first undoubtful country record), and on Penicillidia pachymela from Tanzania; Calvatia lilacina from Pakistan; Entoloma shangdongense from Pakistan; Erysiphe quercicola on Ziziphus jujuba (Rosales, Rhamnaceae) and E. urticae on Urtica dioica (Rosales, Urticaceae) from Pakistan; Fanniomyces ceratophorus on Fannia canicularis (Diptera, Faniidae) from the Netherlands; Marasmiellus biformis and M. subnudus from Pakistan; Morchella anatolica from Turkey; Ophiocordyceps ditmarii on Vespula vulgaris (Hymenoptera, Vespidae) from Austria; and Parvacoccum pini on Pinus cembra (Pinales, Pinaceae) from Austria. The new combinations are: Appendiculina gregaria, A. scaptomyzae, and Marasmiellus rodhallii. Analysis of an LSU dataset of Arthrorhynchus including isolates of A. eucampsipodae from Eucampsipoda africanum and Nycteribia spp. hosts, revealed that this taxon is a complex of multiple species segregated by host genus. Analysis of an SSU-LSU dataset of Laboulbeniomycetes sequences revealed support for the recognition of four monophyletic genera within Stigmatomyces sensu lato: Appendiculina, Fanniomyces, Gloeandromyces, and Stigmatomyces sensu stricto. Finally, phylogenetic analyses of Rhytismataceae based on ITS-LSU ribosomal DNA resulted in a close relationship of Parvacoccum pini with Coccomyces strobi.

TI  - Patterns of Infection with Cryptosporidium sp and Giardia sp in Three Species of Free-Ranging Primates in the Peruvian Amazon
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY
AB  - Recent evidence of pathogen transmission to humans from wild primates and a greater recognition of the risk of human pathogen transmission to free-ranging primates have raised awareness of the potential impact of zoonotic pathogen transmission on primate conservation and nonhuman primate and human health. Cryptosporidium and Giardia are zoonotic protozoan parasites transmitted via fecal-oral contamination or water that can cause gastritis or enteritis in human and nonhuman primates. From June 2002 to September 2003, we collected fecal samples noninvasively from two species of tamarins (Saguinus mystax and S. nigrifrons) and one species of titi monkeys (Callicebus cupreus) at the Estacin Biolgica Quebrada Blanco in the Peruvian Amazon to determine the distribution and prevalence of these potential pathogens. We screened 140 fecal samples representing known individuals of each species for Cryptosporidium and Giardia using the Merifluor immunoflourescence assay to determine the prevalence and intensity of infection with these organisms. With the exception of two samples we collected during the same week from a juvenile male Saguinus mystax, all samples were negative for Cryptosporidium. None of the fecal samples were positive for Giardia. The low prevalence of infection we observed limited our ability to examine the effects of demographic and environmental variables on patterns of infection; however, the exceptionally low prevalence of Cryptosporidium suggests that it is not a current health threat to these primate populations. Although the origin of infection with Cryptosporidium in the juvenile male Saguinus mystax cannot be determined, its presence alerts us to the potential for cross-species transmission and highlights the need for more detailed research to improve our understanding of the distribution and diversity of potentially pathogenic protozoa in Neotropical primate populations.

TI  - <i>Arabidopsis</i> WRKY46 coordinates with WRKY70 and WRKY53 in basal resistance against pathogen <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i>
T2  - PLANT SCIENCE
AB  - The WRKY transcription factors are involved in plant resistance against both biotrophic and necrotrophic pathogens. Arabidopsis WRKY46 is specifically induced by salicylic acid (SA) and biotrophic pathogen Pseudomonas syringae infection. To determine its possible roles in plant defense and elucidate potential functional redundancy with structurally related WRKY70 and WRKY53, we examined loss-of-function T-DNA insertion single, double and triple mutants, as well as gain-of-function transgenic WRKY46 over-expressing plants in response to P. syringae. WRKY46 over-expressing plants were more resistant to P. syringae. In contrast, pathogen-infected wrky46wrky70, wrky46wrky53 double mutants and wrky46wrky70wrky53 triple mutants showed increased susceptibility to this pathogen, with increased bacterial growth and more severe disease symptoms. The contrasting responses of gain-of-function plants and loss-of-function mutants were correlated with increased or reduced expression of defense-related PR1 gene. Expression studies of WRKY46,WRKY70, and WRKY53 in various defense-signaling mutants suggested that they are partially involved in SA-signaling pathway. In addition, our findings demonstrated negative cross-regulation among these three genes. These results indicate that WRKY46, WRKY70, and WRKY53 positively regulate basal resistance to P. syringae; and that they play overlapping and synergetic roles in plant basal defense.

TI  - Abundance and richness of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in coffee plantations from Soconusco, Chiapas, Mexico
T2  - REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL
AB  - In the Mexican economy, and especially in the Soconusco region of Chiapas, coffee is economically important, and sustainable management most cover pests and diseases. In this study, we searched for native arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) that could be used as biofertilizers in coffee cultivation. We collected 21 soil samples from seven coffee plantations (Coffea canephora) in November 2015. We used wet sieving and decanting to quantify abundance, richness and composition of morphospecies, as well as their relationships with soil properties. A total of 20 morphospecies and five new records of AMF were obtained, and the most frequent genera were Acaulospora and Glomus. The Toluca and Victoria sites had more morphospecies richness (17 spp. each) than San Agustin, November 20 and San Luis Nexapa (4-7 spp. each). Providencia and Platanar were intermediate but had the highest spore abundance. The dissimilarity of Victoria and Toluca may reflect a low concentration of PO4-3 in the soil. P availability, linked to soil acidity, sems to be regulating these mycorrhizae communities at Soconusco. AMF consortia specific for soil P-levels and acidity, i.e. Acaulospora and Glomus consortia, may occur and be common in the environmental conditions of Mexican coffee plantations, Strains should be tested for compatibility and functionality before using them as native biofertilizers.

TI  - Genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 tracks early interstate transmission of P.1 lineage and diversification within P.2 clade in Brazil
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - The sharp increase of COVID-19 cases in late 2020 has made Brazil the new epicenter of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The novel viral lineages P.1 (Variant of Concern Gamma) and P.2, respectively identified in the Brazilian states of Amazonas and Rio de Janeiro, have been associated with potentially higher transmission rates and antibody neutralization escape. In this study, we performed the whole-genome sequencing of 185 samples isolated from three out of the five Brazilian regions, including Amazonas (North region), Rio Grande do Norte, Paraiba and Bahia (Northeast region), and Rio de Janeiro (Southeast region) in order to monitor the spread of SARS-CoV-2 lineages in Brazil in the first months of 2021. Here, we showed a widespread dispersal of P.1 and P.2 across Brazilian regions and, except for Amazonas, P.2 was the predominant lineage identified in the sampled states. We estimated the origin of P.2 lineage to have happened in February, 2020 and identified that it has differentiated into new clades. Interstate transmission of P.2 was detected since March, but reached its peak in December, 2020 and January, 2021. Transmission of P.1 was also high in December and its origin was inferred to have happened in August 2020. We also confirmed the presence of lineage P.7, recently described in the southernmost region of Brazil, to have spread across the Northeastern states. P.1, P.2 and P.7 are descended from the ancient B.1.1.28 strain, which co-dominated the first phase of the pandemic in Brazil with the B.1.1.33 strain. We also identified the occurrence of a new lineage descending from B.1.1.33 that convergently carries the E484K mutation, N.9. Indeed, the recurrent report of many novel SARS-CoV-2 genetic variants in Brazil could be due to the absence of effective control measures resulting in high SARS-CoV2 transmission rates. Altogether, our findings provided a landscape of the critical state of SARS-CoV-2 across Brazil and confirm the need to sustain continuous sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 isolates worldwide in order to identify novel variants of interest and monitor for vaccine effectiveness.
   Author summary
   Since its first detection in December 2019, the SARS-CoV-2 has evolved into more than a thousand recognized lineages. Several of these lineages are known to have higher transmissibility or better escape from the immune system. One of them is the P.1 lineage, also known as the variant of concern Gamma. It was first discovered in Brazil in December 2020 and has quickly replaced the previous lineage dominating the country, P.2. We used genomic data from SARS-CoV-2 samples that were collected in the first months of 2021 to analyze how P.1, P.2 and other lineages had spread across Brazil. Our research has identified that P.1 lineage was already present in several states of Brazil almost two months before its first detection in the state of Amazonas. Our work sheds light on the importance of continuous monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 lineages in historically understudied regions to early detect and control the spread of new variants of concern.

TI  - American Cutaneous Leishmaniasis in Panama: a historical review of entomological studies on anthropophilic <i>Lutzomyia</i> sand fly species
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
AB  - We review existing information on the epidemiology of American Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (ACL) in Panama, with emphasis on the bionomics of anthropophilic Lutzomyia sand fly species. Evidence from Panamanian studies suggests that there are six anthropophilic species in the country: Lutzomyia trapidoi, Lu. panamensis, Lu. gomezi, Lu. ylephiletor, Lu. sanguinaria and Lu. pessoana (Henceforth Lu. carrerai thula). In general, these taxa are abundant, widespread and feed opportunistically on their hosts, which make them potential transmitters of pathogens to a broad range of wildlife, domesticated animals and humans. Furthermore, nearly all man-biting species in Panama (with the exception of Lu. gomezi) expand demographically during the rainy season when transmission is likely higher due to elevated Leishmania infection rates in vector populations. Despite this, data on the distribution and prevalence of ACL suggest little influence of vector density on transmission intensity. Apart from Lu. trapidoi, anthropophilic species seem to be most active in the understory, but vertical stratification, as well as their opportunistic feeding behavior, could vary geographically. This in turn seems related to variation in host species composition and relative abundance across sites that have experienced different degrees of human alteration (e. g., deforestation) in leishmaniasis endemic regions of Panama.

TI  - A re-assessment of priority amphibian species of Peru
T2  - TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE
AB  - Peru supports approximately 588 amphibian species, of which 492 have been assessed on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Of these, 111 are classified as Threatened, with 69 species classified as Critically Endangered or Endangered. In addition, 140 amphibian species remain Data Deficient. We re-assessed the conservation status of 38 amphibian species originally identified as potentially Threatened by von May et al. (2008), using the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria. Fourteen species assessments changed as a result of re-assessment, of which eight changed from Data Deficient to Threatened; two changed from Data Deficient to Near Threatened and Least Concern respectively; two were up-listed from Least Concern to a Threatened status; two were down-listed. None of the changes were due to a known genuine change since the previous assessment. All changes were justified by an increase in knowledge. The eight species with a change from Data Deficient to a Threatened category belonged to four anuran families: Craugastoridae, Dendrobatidae, Hemiphractidae and Telmatobiidae. The reasons for a change in assessment status were: changes in taxonomy, distribution, population status, threat status, or previously incorrect information. The main threat affecting re-assessed amphibian species was habitat loss, with other threats including pollution, disease outbreaks, and collection for the pet trade. Only 53% of the re-assessed species were found to occur in a protected area. Findings of this study indicate the continuing fragility of many Peruvian amphibians and highlight the need for improving their protection and for further research into their population status and threats.

TI  - INTEGRATED MANAGEMENT OF JATROPHA ROOT ROT CAUSED BY <i>RHIZOCTONIA BATATICOLA</i>
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL FOREST SCIENCE
AB  - KUMAR S, SHARMA S, PATHAK DV & BENIWAL J. 2011. Integrated management of jatropha root rot caused by Rhizoctonia bataticola. Root rot of jatropha caused by Rhizoctonia bataticola is an important disease reported recently in Haryana, India. Management studies were initiated to reduce the disease using fungicides, plant extracts and biocontrol agents. Results revealed that Bavistin and Vitavax were effective in inhibiting the growth of R. bataticola and reducing the incidence of jatropha root rot. These fungicides resulted in 100% inhibition of mycelial growth at 50 ppm. Seed treatment with Bavistin and its soil drenching caused the least pre-emergence (16.7%) and post-emergence mortalities (10.1%). In in vitro studies, neem extract at 20% concentration provided 55.6% inhibition. Trichoderma harzianum showed the highest mycelia] growth inhibition (58.9 %) against R. bataticola. Bavistin alone at 2 g kg(-1) seed was found to be the most effective treatment with 36.3% reduction in root rot. Integrated methods showed higher disease reduction compared with single method. Bavistin (2 g kg(-1) seed) + neem extract (20%) was the most effective treatment with 67.3% reduction followed by T. harzianum (15 g kg(-1) seed) + Bavistin (54.2%) and neem extract + T. harzianum (44.0%).

T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL FOREST SCIENCE
AB  - Screening of seven systemic and non-systemic fungicides in in vitro studies revealed the superiority of all the fungicides in controlling mycelial growth of Fusarium solani which causes root rot of Prosopis cineraria, though their efficacy varied. Topsin-M showed 11% inhibition at 50 ppm whereas Emisan and Bavistin did so at 100 ppm concentration. Bavistin and Topsin-M also retained their supremacy in seed treatment and pre sowing drenching. Soil amendments with crop residues or oil cakes indicated mustard cake amendment as most effective followed by cotton cake and saw dust. Biological antagonist Trichoderma viride controlled the disease to 50% under in vivo condition.

TI  - Occurrence of the anamorphic stage of <i>Ophiocordyceps myrmicarum</i> on a non-Formicidae insect in integrated crop-livestock farming systems
T2  - FUNGAL ECOLOGY
AB  - An enzootic is reported of Ophiocordyceps myrmicarum in field populations of a non-Formicidae insect, the brown shield stink bug Scaptocoris castanea (Hemiptera: Cydnidae). An on -farm epidemiological study was conducted in three previously established integrated crop-livestock systems (ICLSs), seen as sustainable approaches to farming intensification and characterized by rotation or succession of crops and pastures, as follows: (1) 4 y of annual crops (soybean in the summer and a cover crop in the winter), followed by 4 y of pasture (Panicum maximum and Cajanus cajan consortium); (2) 4 y of pasture and 4 y of annual crops (same species as before); (3) 3 y of pasture (Brachiaria brizantha) and 1 y of annual crops (same as before); as well as areas with either continuous pasture (Brachiaria decumbens) or continuous annual crops (same as before). The incidence of this fungus on S. castanea was monitored over a 2 y period, and areawide average infection levels of nymphs and adults were in the 39.7-89.6% and 65.0-98.1% ranges, respectively. Although the number of infected bugs was positively correlated to insect density, different ICLSs had minimal influence on the incidence of the disease. This is the first report of O. myrmicarum in its anamorphic stage (Hirsutella-like) causing infection on burrowing bugs, and the observed infection levels reported under different farming systems could lead to interest in assessment of its potential as a biological control agent of S. castanea, a severe pest of many pastures and crops in the Neotropical region.

TI  - MACRONUTRIENT DEFICIENCY SYMPTOMS IN <i>BETULA ALNOIDES</i> SEEDLINGS
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL FOREST SCIENCE
AB  - CHEN L, ZENG J, XU DP, ZHAO ZG & GUO JJ. 2010. Macronutrient deficiency in symptoms Betula alnoides seedlings. The decline in seedling quality and production of birch tree (Betula alnoides) is often associated with nutrient stress. Visual foliar symptoms, growth performance, pigment compositions and nutrient interaction of birch seedlings in response to six macronutrient deficiencies were studied. Visual foliar symptoms were most obvious in no nitrogen (-N), no potassium (-K) and no magnesium (-Mg) seedlings but not apparent in no calcium (-Ca) seedlings. Except for -Mg and no sulphur (-S) treatments, seedlings lacking other nutrients showed decreases in most of the growth measurements but an increase in root/shoot ratio. Phosphorous deficiency had no effect on all fractions of pigments, while N and K deficiencies resulted in reductions in chlorophyll-a (chla), chlorophyll-b (chlb), total chlorophyll (chl) and carotenoid (car) but increases in chla/chlb and car/chl ratios. Vector analyses showed that N deficiency not only decreased leaf N concentration but also increased leaf P concentration, possibly because of the antagonism between both ions. Similarly, K, Ca and S deficiencies induced a slight decrease in leaf N concentration that could be explained by a synergism between N and these ions. This kind of nutrient interaction also occurred between P and S in -P seedlings or between Mg and Ca in -Mg seedlings. The findings provided a guideline for diagnosing major macronutrient deficiencies of seedlings. The theoretical foundation for silviculture of B. alnoides will help improve seedling quality and accelerate the sustainable plantation of this species.

TI  - INTRODUCTION OF THE RS-AFP2 GENE INTO <i>EUCALYPTUS UROPHYLLA</i> FOR RESISTANCE TO <i>PHYTOPHTHORA CAPSICI</i>
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL FOREST SCIENCE
AB  - OUYANG LJ, HE WH, HUANG ZC, ZHAO LY, PENG SH, SHA YE, ZENG FH & LU XY. 2012. Introduction of the RS-AFP2 gene into Eucalyptus urophylla for resistance to Phytophthora capsici. We developed an Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation system for Eucalyptus urophylla using hypocotyl explants. Antibiotic concentrations, pre-culture times, pH of the inoculation medium and co-culture times were optimised. Pre-cultured hypocotyl explants were co-cultured with A. tumefaciens strain EHA105 harbouring the binary vector pPBR-2 containing the Rs-AFP2 gene, which encodes an antifungal protein, under the control of the prp1-1 promoter, for six days and were then transferred to selective callogenesis-inducing medium containing kanamycin and cefotaxime. Calluses developed shoots and were cultured in an elongation medium and finally multiplied. The integration of T-DNA into the genome of transgenic E. urophylla was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The reverse transcription (RT)-PCR results showed that Rs-AFP2 gene expression could be detected only after the transformed plants were inoculated with Phytophthora capsici 60 hours after inoculation. These results indicated that the prp1-1 promoter was inducible and Rs-AFP2 could enhance the resistance of E. urophylla to P capsici. This protocol enabled effective transformation and regeneration of E. urophylla.

TI  - Reproductive phenologies of phyllostomid bat populations and ensembles from lowland Amazonia
T2  - JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY
AB  - Natural selection should favor individuals that synchronize energy-demanding aspects of reproductive activity with periods of high resource abundance and predictability, leading to seasonal patterns of reproduction at the population level. Nonetheless, few studies-especially those on bats in the Neotropics-have used rigorous quantitative criteria to distinguish among phenological patterns for different populations from the same habitat or for the same species in different habitats. To explore such issues, we quantified annual patterns of reproduction in male and in female bats from lowland Amazonia (environs of Iquitos, Peru), and did so at the level of populations and ensembles. Five species exhibited unimodal patterns including Artibeus obscurus, A. planirostris, Carollia benkeithi, Phyllostomus hastatus, and Rhinophylla pumilio. Two species (A. lituratus and Glossophaga soricina) evinced bimodal patterns with reproductive peaks separated by patterns of inactivity, whereas four species (C. brevicauda, C. perspicillata, Sturnira lilium, and S. tildae) evinced a bimodal pattern in which peaks in activity occur in tandem, with the first peak generally markedly higher than the second peak. Frugivore, gleaning animalivore, and nectarivore ensembles exhibited bimodal, unimodal, and bimodal reproductive phenologies, respectively. Nonetheless, interannual variation in phenology (i.e., the monthly timing of peaks within a season rather than the number of peaks per year) characterized four (A. obscurus, C. brevicauda, C. perspicillata, and S. lilium) of the eight species and each of the three ensembles (frugivores, gleaning animalivores, and nectarivores) with adequate sampling. Regardless of interspecific variation in strategies, the phenology of reproduction enhances the likelihood that parturition and recruitment of young into the population occurs during the wet season, the period of likely highest resource abundance. Based on a comparison of our results with those from other well-studied bat populations, four species did not exhibit geographic variation in reproductive phenologies (A. obscurus, G. soricina, C. brevicauda, and R. pumilio), whereas three species evinced such geographic variation (A. lituratus, A. planirostris, and C. perspicillata). Climate change will likely alter the seasons and extents of propitious times for reproductive activities, as well as the reliability of proximate cues for initiating reproduction, compromising current reproductive strategies and leading to altered phenological patterns of reproduction or reproductive success, possibly resulting in local extinction of some species.

TI  - Bark Harvesting Systems of <i>Drimys brasiliensis</i> Miers in the Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest
T2  - ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS
AB  - Drimys brasiliensis Miers, locally known as cataia or casca-de-anta, is a native tree species of the Atlantic Rainforest. Its bark is harvested from natural populations. This study examined the recovery capacity of the bark of D. brasiliensis under different bark harvesting methods, as well as the influence of these approaches on its population dynamics and reproductive biology. While none of these treatments resulted in changes in phenological behavior or the rate of increase of diameter at breast height and tree height, the removal of wider bark strips resulted in lower rates of bark recovery and higher rates of insect attack and diseases. Accordingly, the results recommend using strips of bark 2 cm wide and 2 m long, with 4 cm between strips, for effective rates of bark regrowth and for lower susceptibility to insect attack and diseases. From these studies, we concluded that D. brasiliensis has a high potential for sustainable management of its natural populations, demonstrating the possibility of generating an important supplementary income for farmers and contributing to the use and conservation of the Atlantic Rainforest.

TI  - Cultivation potential of<i> Vanilla</i> crop wild relatives in two contrasting land use systems
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY
AB  - Vanilla is an important cash crop for many smallholder farmers around the tropics, and a highly appreciated spice used in a wide range of products. The crop species Vanilla planifolia is, however, facing a number of threats that are jeopardizing a stable vanilla supply. The neotropical realm holds at least 37 fragrant Vanilla species besides V. planifolia. These so-called Vanilla crop wild relatives (CWRs) possibly possess interesting traits for crop improvement and market diversification, but received meager attention so far. The aim of our study was therefore to provide insights into the cultivation potential of four Vanilla CWRs (Vanilla hartii, V. odorata, V. pompona and V. trigonocarpa) naturally growing within our study region in southern Costa Rica, by comparing their plant performance and aromatic profiles with V. planifolia and a commercially used hybrid, and this in two types of land use systems where vanilla could possibly be introduced. As such, we established six field sites in secondary forests (SF), adding economic value to these often undervalued ecosystems, and six in existing cacao plantations (CP), diversifying monocrop agrosystems. First, we measured plant survival, vitality and growth over a period of two years, and compared these plant performance traits among Vanilla species and land use systems using (generalized) additive mixed models. The models also enabled us to observe possible effects of additionally measured, site-specific environmental variables on vanilla plant performance. Second, we evaluated the aromatic potential of Vanilla CWR pods using high-performance liquid chromatography. We found that the hybrid had the highest overall plant vitality and growth, and this in both CPs and SFs, while V. planifolia was characterized by a rather low vitality, but high growth rates, and clearly performed inferior in SFs. The CWRs had a good overall vitality, and this in the two land use systems, but were characterized by lower growth rates compared to the hybrid and V. planifolia. The aromatic profiles of the Vanilla CWR pods indicated potential for market diversi-fication, with V. odorata highly resembling the profile of the commercially used species. The other CWRs had varied profiles, with especially V. hartii containing high anisyl contents interesting for niche markets. Based on our assessment of Vanilla CWR plant performance and aromatic profiles, we see potential for their integration within the two studied land use systems. Corresponding planting designs should, however, take into account species-specific light intensity preferences, monitor chemical properties and the presence of growth-promoting and disease-suppressive soil microbiota, and incorporate vanilla tutor and shade trees with optimal functional traits. We developed a possible vanilla cultivation design that could be implemented for further evaluation in terms of production feasibility.

TI  - An Investigation of ZZ/ZW and XX/XY Sex Determination Systems in North African Catfish (<i>Clarias gariepinus</i>, Burchell, 1822)
T2  - FRONTIERS IN GENETICS
AB  - An investigation of sex-specific loci may provide important insights into fish sex determination strategies. This may be useful for biotechnological purposes, for example, to produce all-male or all-female fish for commercial breeding. The North African catfish species, Clarias gariepinus, has been widely adopted for aquaculture because its superior growth and disease resistance render the species suitable for hybridization with other catfish to improve the productivity and quality of fish meat. This species has either a ZZ/ZW or XX/XY sex determination system. Here, we investigate and characterize these systems using high-throughput genome complexity reduction sequencing as Diversity Arrays Technology. This approach was effective in identifying moderately sex-linked loci with both single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and restriction fragment presence/absence (PA) markers in 30 perfectly sexed individuals of C. gariepinus. However, SNPs based markers were not found in this study. In total, 41 loci met the criteria for being moderately male-linked (with male vs. female ratios 80:20 and 70:30), while 25 loci were found to be moderately linked to female sex. No strictly male- or female-linked loci were detected. Seven moderately male-linked loci were partially homologous to some classes of transposable elements and three moderately male-linked loci were partially homologous to functional genes. Our data showed that the male heterogametic XX/XY sex determination system should co-exist with the ZZ/ZW system in C. gariepinus. Our finding of the co-existence of XX/XY and ZZ/ZW systems can be applied to benefit commercial breeding of this species in Thailand. This approach using moderately sex-linked loci provides a solid baseline for revealing sex determination mechanisms and identify potential sex determination regions in catfish, allowing further investigation of genetic improvements in breeding programs.

TI  - In Vitro Antibacterial Activities of Methanolic Extracts of Fruits, Seeds, and Bark of <i>Zanthoxylum armatum</i> DC
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE
AB  - Crude methanol extracts of fruits, seeds, and bark of Zanthoxylum armatum were investigated in vitro for antimicrobial activities against 9 different bacterial strains: Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella dysenteriae, Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and Staphylococcus epidermidis using agar well diffusion method, and the MBC values were determined. Only 5 bacteria, i.e., Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, MRSA, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis exhibited antibacterial properties against the different extracts. The fruit and seed extracts showed activities against 5 bacteria, while the bark extract was active against 2 bacteria only (MRSA and Staphylococcus aureus). Staphylococcus aureus was found to be more susceptible for all the extracts compared to other strains. The maximum ZOI of 20.72 mm was produced by fruits (wild) and 18.10 mm (cultivated) against Staphylococcus aureus. Likewise, the least ZOI of 11.73 mm was produced by seeds (wild) and 11.29 mm (cultivated) against Escherichia faecalis. Similarly, the lowest MBC value of 0.78 mg/mL was obtained for fruit extracts against MRSA, 1.56 mg/mL for fruits, seeds, and bark extracts against Bacillus subtilis, M RSA, and Staphylococcus aureus, and highest value of 50 mg/ml, for fruits and seeds extracts against S. epidermidis. The fruits, seeds, and bark extracts of Z. armatum exhibited remarkable antibacterial properties against different pathogenic bacteria causing several diseases, which suggests the potential use of this plant for treating different bacterial diseases such as skin infection, urinary tract infection, dental problems, diarrhea, and dysentery.

TI  - Exergy intensity and environmental consequences of the medical face masks curtailing the COVID-19 pandemic: Malign bodyguard?
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization identified SARS-CoV-2 as a public health emergency of global concern. Accordingly, the demand for personal protective equipment (PPE), including medical face masks, has sharply risen compared with 2019. The new situation has led to a sharp increase in energy demand and the environmental impacts associated with these product systems. Hence, the pandemic's effects on the environmental consequences of various PPE types, such as medical face masks, should be assessed. In light of that, the current study aimed to identify the environmental hot-spots of medical face mask production and consumption by using life cycle assessment (LCA) and tried to provide solutions to mitigate the adverse impacts. Based on the results obtained, in 2020, medical face masks production using fossil-based plastics causes the loss of 2.03 x 103 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs); 1.63 x 108 PDF*m2*yr damage to ecosystem quality; the climatedamaging release of 2.13 x 109 kg CO2eq; and 5.65 x 1010 MJ damage to resources. Besides, annual medical face mask production results in 5.88 x 104 TJ demand for exergy. On the other hand, if used makes are not appropriately handled, they can lead to 4.99 x 105 Pt/yr additional damage to the environment in 2020 as determined by the EDIP 2003. Replacement of fossil-based plastics with bio-based plastics, at rates ranging from 10 to 100%, could mitigate the product's total yearly environmental damage by 4-43%, respectively. Our study calls attention to the environmental sustainability of PPE used to prevent virus transmission in the current and future pandemics.

TI  - Transcriptional Changes in the Hookworm, <i>Ancylostoma caninum</i>, during the Transition from a Free-Living to a Parasitic Larva
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background: Third-stage larvae (L3) of the canine hookworm, Ancylostoma caninum, undergo arrested development preceding transmission to a host. Many of the mRNAs up-regulated at this stage are likely to encode proteins that facilitate the transition from a free- living to a parasitic larva. The initial phase of mammalian host invasion by A. caninum L3 (herein termed "activation'') can be mimicked in vitro by culturing L3 in serum-containing medium.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: The mRNAs differentially transcribed between activated and non-activated L3 were identified by suppression subtractive hybridisation (SSH). The analysis of these mRNAs on a custom oligonucleotide microarray printed with the SSH expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and publicly available A. caninum ESTs (non-subtracted) yielded 602 differentially expressed mRNAs, of which the most highly represented sequences encoded members of the pathogenesis-related protein (PRP) superfamily and proteases. Comparison of these A. caninum mRNAs with those of Caenorhabditis elegans larvae exiting from developmental (dauer) arrest demonstrated unexpectedly large differences in gene ontology profiles. C. elegans dauer exiting L3 up-regulated expression of mostly intracellular molecules involved in growth and development. Such mRNAs are virtually absent from activated hookworm larvae, and instead are over-represented by mRNAs encoding extracellular proteins with putative roles in host-parasite interactions.
   Conclusions/Significance: Although this should not invalidate C. elegans dauer exit as a model for hookworm activation, it highlights the limitations of this free- living nematode as a model organism for the transition of nematode larvae from a free-living to a parasitic state.

TI  - Eucalypt powdery mildew caused by <i>Podosphaera pannosa</i> in Brazil
T2  - TROPICAL PLANT PATHOLOGY
AB  - Eucalypt powdery mildew is an important disease in greenhouses and clonal hedges of Eucalyptus spp. in Brazil, which can cause leaf and shoot distortion, shoot discoloration, and growth reduction that results in production losses. Because reliable information regarding the causal agent of the disease is lacking, this study used ITS and 28S rDNA sequencing and morphological analyses to identify the powdery mildew pathogen that occurrs in eucalypt nurseries within different regions in Brazil. Based on the results of morphological characteristics and phylogenetic analyses, the pathogen isolates were identified as Podosphaera pannosa, also known as the rose powdery mildew pathogen. Cross inoculations with pathogen isolates from rose and eucalypt demonstrated that P. pannosa can infect both host species. The ITS sequence-based phylogeny showed that 42 sequences generated in this study were comprised within a single clade containing P. pannosa, which was supported by a posterior probability of 88%. Identical ITS sequences were obtained from all 42 pathogen isolates, which suggests a clonal population.

TI  - Population Ecology of Hantavirus Rodent Hosts in Southern Brazil
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - In this study we analyze population dynamics of hantavirus rodent hosts and prevalence of infection over a 2-year period in Southern Brazil, a region with a high incidence of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. The 14 small mammal species captured were composed of 10 rodents and four marsupials, the six most abundant species being Akodon serrensis, Oxymycterus judex, Akodon montensis, Akodon paranaensis, Oligoryzomys nigripes, and Thaptomys. nigrita. These species displayed a similar pattern with increasing population sizes in fall/winter caused by recruitment and both, increase in reproductive activity and higher hantavirus prevalence in spring/summer. Specific associations between A. montensis/Jabora Virus (JABV) and O. nigripes/Juquitiba-like Virus (JUQV-like) and spillover infections between A. paranaensis/JABV, A. serrensis/JABV, and A. paranaensis/JUQV-like were observed. Spillover infection in secondary hosts seems to play an important role in maintaining JABV and JUQV-like in the hantavirus sylvatic cycle mainly during periods of low prevalence in primary hosts.

TI  - Spatial-temporal distribution of preimaginal blackflies in Neotropical streams
T2  - HYDROBIOLOGIA
AB  - The current study investigates the spatial-temporal distribution of preimaginal blackflies in three a priori established, adjacent areas of Brazil and Venezuela. First we tested the hypothesis that the distribution of individual simuliid species, over two geographic scales, were predictable on the basis of several habitat parameters. Secondly, we determined if local species assemblages remain constant over two spatial axes, i.e., were species assemblages predictable within and between defined regions. Finally we compared the species assemblage between Venezuelan streams sampled in both the wet (October) and dry (February) seasons. As stream conditions changed across a north-south gradient, so did the occurrence of the most common species. This change in species composition from upland to lowland areas is consistent with the patterns of faunal change seen in North American simuliid assemblages. Discriminant Function Analysis showed a strong association between regional demarcations and stream site conditions. These results were paralleled by the strong correspondence between species assemblages and these regions. Thus each region presented both distinct stream environments and species assemblages. Monte Carlo analysis suggests that some if not all species are not only present in both the wet and dry season but that they are continuing to use the same stream sites. Three broad contingent rules for blackfly species assemblages in new world streams are put forward; (i) the ubiquitous nature of simuliids; (ii) species often distribute themselves along an axis of stream size and; (iii) there is a strong and consistent correspondence between regional characteristics of streams and the species assemblage.

TI  - Lead-associated deficits in stature, mental ability and behaviour in children in Karachi
T2  - ANNALS OF TROPICAL PAEDIATRICS
AB  - This study was conducted to evaluate the cumulative and steady-state lead burden in children from Karachi, an area of high lead exposure, and to assess the degree of damage to physical growth and mental ability related to lead exposure. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in seven primary schools from around Karachi. Shed primary teeth and blood samples were collected from students of grades I to III (age range 6-10 years) and were analysed for lead by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Haemoglobin concentration, height, weight and head circumference were measured. IQ was estimated using Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices. Classroom behaviour was rated by teachers and school performance was estimated from the percentage mark in a school examination taken just before the date of the IQ test. Complete data were available for 138 children. Over 80% of children had lead levels above the safety limit set by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The blood lead levels in boys did not differ significantly from that in girls. Significant differences were observed between the schools. Univariate analysis showed negative association of blood lead with haemoglobin, IQ and height. Tooth lead was negatively associated with height, classroom behaviour and performance. When adjusted for other confounding variables, blood lead was negatively associated with haemoglobin and IQ, whereas tooth lead was negatively associated only with classroom behaviour. Height was negatively associated with blood or tooth lead. These results were further supported when the upper and lower quintiles for blood or tooth lead were compared. Tooth lead level was not a better marker of lead poisoning than blood lead level in our study population. These data demonstrate the association of increased lead with impaired learning and adverse behaviour in Karachi children and call for strict government regulations to limit environmental lead burden.

TI  - Advantages of seed dispersal: A re-evaluation of directed dispersal
T2  - EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY RESEARCH
AB  - Seed dispersal can be advantageous (1) in escape from density- or distance-dependent seed and seedling mortality, (2) by colonization of suitable sites unpredictable in space and time, and (3) by directed dispersal to particular sites with a relatively high probability of survival. Most previous research on the consequences of seed dispersal has focused on escape and colonization because adaptations ensuring directed dispersal are not expected under the paradigm of diffuse mutualism that characterizes the modern view of seed dispersal evolution. In this paper, I suggest that directed dispersal is more common than previously believed even in the absence of plant adaptations to promote it. Directed dispersal may be seen in particular among animal-dispersed plants and in arid ecosystems or successional areas, but has been overlooked due to the lack of detailed data on seed shadows generated by particular species, and the fact that the alternative advantages of dispersal are not mutually exclusive. Although directed dispersal is never thought to be the only advantage of dispersal, it may often be ecologically important if one dispersal vector has a disproportionate effect on plant recruitment. Furthermore, in human-disturbed and managed ecosystems, directed dispersal may be important in restoration. More studies detailing the consequences of different patterns of seed dispersal will be useful for conservation and management strategies.

TI  - <i>First record of Borrelia burgdorferi</i> sensu lato antibodies in stray dogs in the Northwest Region of Parana State, Brazil
T2  - SEMINA-CIENCIAS AGRARIAS
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the occurrence of B. burgdorferi sensu lato s.l. antibodies in stray dogs of the urban area of Umuarama Town, localized in the northwest region of Parana state, Brazil. Serum samples from 168 dogs were tested using indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and Western Blot (WB) in order to detect anti-Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. antibodies. The IFI analysis was used as screening test and positive results were confirmed employing the WB technique. Sixty-five (38.69%) of 168 serum samples were positive in the IFI; 54 of them (83.07%) were confirmed by the WB. The overall data analysis confirmed the presence of anti-B. burgdorferi s.l. antibodies in 32.14% (54/168) dogs, what suggests that northwest region of Parana State may constitute a risk area for Lyme disease. Further studies are necessary to determine the epidemiological characteristics of this disease in the region studied.

TI  - Linking bioprospecting with sustainable development and conservation:: the Panama case
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
CP  - Conference on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services in Developing Countries
AB  - The limited international resources for economic aid and conservation can only mitigate poverty and losses of biodiversity. Hence, developing nations must establish the capacity to resolve their problems. Additionally, policy-makers and donors need to obtain scientific input on issues such as global change and ecosystem services. We propose that for nations rich in biodiversity, ecosystem services derived from bioprospecting, or drug discovery, could contribute to economic development. In the case where unstudied samples are shipped abroad for research, the chances of obtaining royalties are infinitesimally small. Therefore developing nations will only realize benefits from bioprospecting through in-country research on their own biodiversity. Policy-makers and donors have failed to appreciate the value of this approach. In order to provide an example of the inherent links between conservation and sustainable economic development, we initiated a drug discovery effort in Panama that emphasizes local benefit. As much of the drug discovery process as possible is conducted in Panamanian laboratories, providing jobs dependent on intact biodiversity and enhancing local research and training. In short, research, plus the spin-offs from research, provide immediate and long-lasting benefits to Panama. The connection between conservation and development has been highlighted in publicity about the project in Panama's urban media. This provides a constructive alternative to the perception the among the urban populace that economic development inevitably competes with conservation. In summary, our program uses biodiversity to promote human health as well as to support research capacity, economic development and conservation within Panama. The program provides an example of the widely recognized but little developed concept of bioprospecting research as an ecosystem service.

TI  - Larval Breeding Sites of <i>Lutzomyia longipalpis</i> (Diptera: Psychodidae) in Visceral Leishmaniasis Endemic Urban Areas in Southeastern Brazil
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background: The scarcity of information on the immature stages of sand flies and their preferred breeding sites has resulted in the focus of vectorial control on the adult stage using residual insecticide house-spraying. This strategy, along with the treatment of human cases and the euthanasia of infected dogs, has proven inefficient and visceral leishmaniasis continues to expand in Brazil. Identifying the breeding sites of sand flies is essential to the understanding of the vector's population dynamic and could be used to develop novel control strategies.
   Methodology/Principal finding: In the present study, an intensive search for the breeding sites of Lutzomyia longipalpis was conducted in urban and peri-urban areas of two municipalities, Promissao and Dracena, which are endemic for visceral leishmaniasis in Sao Paulo State, Brazil. During an exploratory period, a total of 962 soil emergence traps were used to investigate possible peridomiciliary breeding site microhabitats such as: leaf litter under tree, chicken sheds, other animal sheds and uncovered debris. A total of 160 sand flies were collected and 148 (92.5%) were L. longipalpis. In Promissao the proportion of chicken sheds positive was significantly higher than in leaf litter under trees. Chicken shed microhabitats presented the highest density of L. longipalpis in both municipalities: 17.29 and 5.71 individuals per square meter sampled in Promissao and Dracena respectively. A contagious spatial distribution pattern of L. longipalpis was identified in the emergence traps located in the chicken sheds.
   Conclusion: The results indicate that chicken sheds are the preferential breeding site for L. longipalpis in the present study areas. Thus, control measures targeting the immature stages in chicken sheds could have a great effect on reducing the number of adult flies and consequently the transmission rate of Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum chagasi.

TI  - Dengue Incidence and Sociodemographic Conditions in Pucallpa, Peruvian Amazon: What Role for Modification of the Dengue-Temperature Relationship?
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Dengue is a climate-sensitive disease with an increasing global burden. Although the relationship between meteorological conditions and dengue incidence is well established, less is known about the modifying nature of sociodemographic variables on that relationship. We assess the strength and direction of sociodemographic effect modification of the temperature-dengue relationship in the second largest city of the Peruvian Amazon to identify populations that may have heightened vulnerability to dengue under varying climate conditions. We used weekly dengue counts and averaged meteorological variables to evaluate the association between disease incidence, meteorological exposures, and sociodemographic effect modifiers (gender, age, and district) in negative binomial regression models. District was included to consider geographical effect modification. We found that being a young child or elderly, being female, and living in the district of Manantay increased dengue's incidence rate ratio (IRR) as a result of 1 degrees C increase in weekly mean temperature (IRR = 2.99, 95% CI: 1.99-4.50 for women less than 5 years old and IRR = 2.86, 95% CI: = 1.93-4.22 for women older than 65 years, both estimates valid for the rainy season). The effect of temperature on dengue depended on season, with stronger effects during rainy seasons. Sociodemographic variables can provide options for intervention to mitigate health impacts with a changing climate. Our results indicate that patterns of baseline risk between regions and sociodemographic conditions can differ substantially from trends in climate sensitivity. These results challenge the assumption that the distribution of climate change impacts will be patterned similarly to existing social gradients in health.

TI  - A host-parasite model explains variation in liana infestation among co-occurring tree species
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
AB  - Lianas are structural parasites of trees that reduce the growth, survival and reproduction of their hosts. Given that co-occurring tree species differ strongly in the proportion of individuals that are infested by lianas (liana prevalence), lianas could differentially impact tree species and thereby influence tree community composition. Surprisingly, little is known about what governs variation in liana prevalence. Here, we apply an approach inspired by disease ecology to investigate the dynamics of liana prevalence over 11years on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. We followed the fate of 1,938 individual trees from 21 tree species, recording deaths and change in liana infestation status. With these data, we fit species-specific Markov chain models to estimate four rates: colonization by lianas (analogous to disease transmission), shedding or loss of lianas (analogous to host recovery), baseline mortality of uninfested trees (baseline mortality) and additional mortality of infested trees (parasite lethality). Models explained 58% of variation in liana prevalence among tree species, and revealed that host shedding of lianas and parasite lethality were the most important contributors to interspecific variation in liana prevalence at our site. These rates were also strongly related to shade tolerance, with light-demanding species having greater rates of shedding and lethality, and lower rates of liana prevalence. An indirect path analysis with a structural equation model revealed that both greater rates of liana shedding and liana-induced lethality contribute to the observed lower rates of liana prevalence for light-demanding tree species.Synthesis. Our approach revealed that the prevalence of liana infestation among tree species is driven via indirect pathways operating on the rates of shedding and lethality, which relate to the ability (or inability) of trees to shed and/or tolerate lianas. Shade-tolerant trees have greater proportions of trees infested by lianas because they are both less able to shed lianas and more able to tolerate infestation.

TI  - <i>Ganoderma</i> basidiospore germination responses as affected by spore density, temperature and nutrient media
T2  - TROPICAL PLANT PATHOLOGY
AB  - The present study investigated the axenic basidiospore germination of Ganoderma australe, G. mastoporum and G. philippii at three spore densities in five nutrient media encompassing a range of carbohydrate complexity, in combination with sawdust and/or ethanol as medium additives. Five incubation temperatures ranging from 10 to 35 A degrees C were used, totalling 300 treatment combinations. A Weibull model, with the asymptote occurring at 50 to 75 h, provided good fit to percentage spore germination data at each treatment combination for all three Ganoderma species. Ganoderma australe and G. mastoporum basidiospores germinated on all media, whereas G. philippii basidiospores required media that contained 2% ethanol. The best medium for G. australe and G. mastoporum basidiospore germination was rice dextrose agar with a mixture of Eucalyptus and Acacia sawdust, whereas for G. philippii it was 1% malt extract agar plus ethanol, with or without sawdust. Spore density was also critical to achieving the best germination rate, with similar to 400 spores/cm(2) optimal for all three species. As Ganoderma root rot disease affects commercial Acacia mangium and Eucalyptus pellita plantations, the greater understanding of basidiospore germination gained from the current study should assist in developing strategies to contain the dispersal and spread of root rot in Indonesia and other southeast Asian countries where these species have been planted.

TI  - <i>Rhodnius prolixus</i> Colonization and <i>Trypanosoma cruzi</i> Transmission in Oil Palm (<i>Elaeis guineensis</i>) Plantations in the Orinoco Basin, Colombia
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Trypanosome cruzi is the etiological agent of Chagas disease that infects more than seven million people in Latin America. The parasite is transmitted by triatomine insects, of which some species are often associated with palms. The establishment of oil palm plantations (Elaeis guineensis) in the Orinoco region (Colombia) has been rapidly growing, possibly constituting a new environment for the establishment and increase in triatomine populations. In this study, the potential of Rhodnius prolixus to colonize E. guineensis plantations and maintain T. cruzi transmission was assessed. Fieldwork was conducted in two areas located in the department of Casanare for sampling E. guineensis and Attalea butyracea palms, sampling for triatomines to determine their abundance and prevalence of T. cruzi infection. To assess T. cruzi transmission potential in the area, sylvatic and domestic mammals were sampled. Results showed that palm infestation with triatomines was higher in A. butyracea than in E. guineensis palms and T. cruzi infection in triatomines varied between habitats for one study area, but was constant in the other site. Trypanosome cruzi-infected mammals in the E. guineensis plantations were mainly generalist rodents, suggesting that these mammals could have an important role in T. cruzi transmission in plantations. In conclusion, E. guineensis plantations in the Orinoco region are suitable habitats for R. prolixus and T. cruzi transmission.

TI  - Prevalence of anopheline species and their <i>Plasmodium</i> infection status in epidemic-prone border areas of Bangladesh
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
AB  - Background: Information related to malaria vectors is very limited in Bangladesh. In the changing environment and various Anopheles species may be incriminated and play role in the transmission cycle. This study was designed with an intention to identify anopheline species and possible malaria vectors in the border belt areas, where the malaria is endemic in Bangladesh.
   Methods: Anopheles mosquitoes were collected from three border belt areas (Lengura, Deorgachh and Matiranga) during the peak malaria transmission season (May to August). Three different methods were used: human landing catches, resting collecting by mouth aspirator and CDC light traps. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was done to detect Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax-210 and Plasmodium vivax-247 circumsporozoite proteins (CSP) from the collected female species.
   Results: A total of 634 female Anopheles mosquitoes belonging to 17 species were collected. Anopheles vagus (was the dominant species (18.6%) followed by Anopheles nigerrimus (14.5%) and Anopheles philippinensis (11.0%). Infection rate was found 2.6% within 622 mosquitoes tested with CSP-ELISA. Eight (1.3%) mosquitoes belonging to five species were positive for P. falciparum, seven (1.1%) mosquitoes belonging to five species were positive for P. vivax -210 and a single mosquito (0.2%) identified as Anopheles maculatus was positive for P. vivax-247. No mixed infection was found. Highest infection rate was found in Anopheles karwari (22.2%) followed by An. maculatus (14.3%) and Anopheles barbirostris (9.5%). Other positive species were An. nigerrimus (4.4%), An. vagus (4.3%), Anopheles subpictus (1.5%) and An. philippinensis (1.4%). Anopheles vagus and An. philippinensis were previously incriminated as malaria vector in Bangladesh. In contrast, An. karwari, An. maculatus, An. barbirostris, An. nigerrimus and An. subpictus had never previously been incriminated in Bangladesh.
   Conclusion: Findings of this study suggested that in absence of major malaria vectors there is a possibility that other Anopheles species may have been playing role in malaria transmission in Bangladesh. Therefore, further studies are required with the positive mosquito species found in this study to investigate their possible role in malaria transmission in Bangladesh.

T2  - ANIMAL BIODIVERSITY AND EMERGING DISEASES: PREDICTION AND PREVENTION
CP  - 9th Biennial Conference on Animal Biodiversity and Emerging Diseases - Prediction and Prevention
AB  - Fourteen plant extracts were evaluated in vitro against the fourth larval stage of Haemonchus contortus. The plants species used were Tagetes erecta, Argemone Mexicana, and Castela tortuosa. The assays were run in 24-well cell culture plates at room temperature with three replicates. After exposure, aliquots were taken from the corresponding wells and transferred to a microscope for observation. Evaluation criteria were based on the average of live and/or dead larvae. ANOVA test and Tukey test were used to determine significant differences among the treatments. After 96 h, the T erecta acetonic extract produced 99.7% lethal activity, followed by C. tortuosa hexanic extract (85.8%) and T erecta methanolic extract (58.3%) (P < 0.0001).

TI  - Physiological and morphological changes in <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> induced by the plant alkaloid camptothecin
T2  - TROPICAL PLANT PATHOLOGY
AB  - Botrytis cinerea causes diseases in plants that lead to severe crop losses. This study aimed to evaluate the physiological and morphological changes and gene expression induced by camptothecin, a monoterpene indole alkaloid, for the control of B. cinerea. Using a single concentration of 8.0 mu g/mL, which showed to reduce 50 % of the dry weight of fungal mycelia, the alkaloid caused a 25 to 30 % reduction in colony diameter from 24 to 72 h of incubation and 34 to 54.7 % reduction in fungal biomass, from 24 to 96 h of incubation. Furthermore, changes in mycelial morphology were noticed based on both scanning and transmission electron microscopic observations. POD activity was reduced by 49.1 %, but PAL and SOD activity were not affected. Moreover, q-PCR analysis showed that the expression of erg27, os1, and SDHB were not affected, but the expression of cytb increased significantly, thus suggesting the involvement of this respiration-related gene in the response of B. cinerea to camptothecin. In summary, the alkaloid has the potential to improve the control of gray mold caused by B. cinerea.

TI  - Genetic diversity, population structure and rickettsias in <i>Amblyomma ovale</i> in areas of epidemiological interest for spotted fever in Brazil
T2  - MEDICAL AND VETERINARY ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - Amblyomma ovale (Ixodida: Ixodidae) Koch, 1844 is widely-reported in the neotropical region and is the main vector in the epidemic cycle of Rickettsia parkeri strain Atlantic rainforest, a bioagent of a milder variety of spotted fever (SF). Because species with wide geographical distributions are known to exhibit variations that influence their vectorial capacity, the present study aimed to analyze genetic diversity and rickettsia infection of A. ovale collected during the investigation and surveillance of SF cases in the Cerrado and Atlantic rainforest (ARF) Brazilian biomes. Samples had their DNA extracted, amplified and sequenced for 16S rDNA, 12S rDNA, cytochrome oxidase subunit II and D-loop markers for tick analyses, as well as the gltA, htrA, ompA and ompB genes for rickettsia detection. Between 11 and 33 A. ovale haplotypes were identified, all of them exclusive to areas within individual analyzed biome areas. The A. ovale populations appeared to be structured, with Cluster I restricted to Cerrado + ARF isolated in Caatinga and Cluster II to ARF continuous area. Rickettsia bellii, R. parkeri strain Atlantic rainforest (first report for Goias state, Cerrado), Rickettsia asemboensis (first record in A. ovale for Brazil) and Rickettsia felis (first detection in this ixodid) were identified. A. ovale clusters were not associated with rickettsia types.

TI  - The ecology of malaria - As seen from Earth-observation satellites
T2  - ANNALS OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND PARASITOLOGY
AB  - Data from sensors on board geostationary and polar-orbiting, meteorological satellites (Meteosat and NOAA series) are routinely obtained free, via local reception systems, in an increasing number of African countries. Data collected by these satellites are processed to produce proxy ecological variables which have been extensively investigated for monitoring changes in the distribution and condition of different natural resources, including rainfall and vegetation state. How these data products (once incorporated, along with other data, into a geographical information system) could contribute to the goals of monitoring patterns of malaria transmission, predicting epidemics and planning control strategies is the subject of the present review. By way of illustration, an analysis of two of these products, normalized difference vegetation index (NVDI) and cold-cloud duration (CCD), is given in conjunction with epidemiological and entomological data from The Gambia, a country where extensive studies on malaria transmission have been undertaken in recent pears. Preliminary results indicate that even simple analysis of proxy ecological variables derived from satellite data can indicate variation in environmental factors affecting malaria-transmission indices. However, it is important to note that the associations observed will vary depending on the local ecology, season and species of vector.
   Whilst further quantitative research is required to validate the relationship between satellite-data products and malaria-transmission indices, this approach offers a means bl which detailed knowledge of the underlying spatial and temporal variation in the environment can be incorporated into a decision-support system for malaria control.

TI  - Parasite loss and introduced species: a comparison of the parasites of the Puerto Rican tree frog, (<i>Eleutherodactylus coqui</i>), in its native and introduced ranges
T2  - BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS
AB  - The Puerto Rican frog, Eleutherodactylus coqui has invaded Hawaii and reached densities far exceeding those in their native range. One possible explanation for the success of E. coqui in its introduced range is that it lost its co-evolved parasites in the process of the invasion. We compared the parasites of E. coqui in its native versus introduced range. We collected parasite data on 160 individual coqui frogs collected during January-April 2006 from eight populations in Puerto Rico and Hawaii. Puerto Rican coqui frogs had higher species richness of parasites than Hawaiian coqui frogs. Parasite prevalence and intensity were significantly higher in Hawaii, however this was likely a product of the life history of the dominant parasite and its minimal harm to the host. This suggests that the scarcity of parasites may be a factor contributing to the success of Eleutherodactylus coqui in Hawaii.

TI  - Perilous proximity: Does the Janzen-Connell hypothesis explain the distribution of giant barrel sponges on a Florida coral reef?
T2  - CORAL REEFS
AB  - One popular concept used to explain the high biodiversity of some ecosystems is the Janzen-Connell hypothesis, which states that the distribution of conspecifics is controlled by species-specific pathogens or predators that are attracted to adults or to their reproductive output. The distribution of the affected species would then display a distinct pattern, with survivorship increasing at greater distance from the conspecific adult (negative density dependence), leaving a vacant area around the adult where other species can survive. The giant barrel sponge, Xestospongia muta, is an abundant and long-lived sponge on Caribbean coral reefs that is actively grazed by sponge-eating fishes and is susceptible to disease. We tested the Janzen-Connell hypothesis on barrel sponges on Conch Reef, Florida, by examining their distribution as a function of size using spatial point pattern analyses. Clark and Evans tests and a series of Ripley's K function analyses revealed no consistent distribution pattern, with most analyses resulting in a random pattern of sponge distribution. While predation by sponge-eating fishes has recently been discovered to structure sponge communities on reefs across the Caribbean, these top-down effects do not translate to spatial distributions of X. muta that support Janzen-Connell predictions.

TI  - EFFECT OF REPEATED TREATMENTS WITH IVERMECTIN ON THE INCIDENCE OF ONCHOCERCIASIS IN NORTHERN CAMEROON
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Mass treatments with ivermectin have been undertaken each year since 1987 in an area hyperendemic for onchocerciasis in northern Cameroon. The impact of these successive treatments on the incidence of infection in humans was evaluated by comparing the prevalence of skin microfilariae (PMF) and the mean microfilarial skin densities (MFD) observed in 1987 and 1992 in 5-7-year-old children who had never taken the drug but who were members of the treated communities. In 1992, the PMF and the MFD in children in this age group who never received ivermectin were reduced by 55% and 77%, respectively, in comparison with the values observed in 1987, before the first treatment round. These results reflect a pronounced reduction in the intensity of the transmission of Onchocerca volvulus in the treatment zone. The influence of the ivermectin treatment coverage in the human population, as well as the vectorial capacity and the dispersal of the vector blackflies, on the transmission of onchocerciasis is discussed.

TI  - Exploring local and global regression models to estimate the spatial variability of Zika and Chikungunya cases in Recife, Brazil
T2  - REVISTA DA SOCIEDADE BRASILEIRA DE MEDICINA TROPICAL
AB  - Introduction: In this study, we aim to compare spatial statistic models to estimate the spatial distribution of Zika and Chikungunya infections in the city of Recife, Brazil. We also aim to establish the relationship between the diseases and the analyzed geographical conditions. Methods: The models were defined by combining three categories: type of spatial unit, calculation of the dependent variable format, and estimation methods (Geographical Weighted Regression [GWR] and Ordinary Least Square [OLS]). We identified the most accurate model to estimate the spatial distribution of the diseases. After selecting the model that provided best results, the relationship between the geographical conditions and the incidence of the diseases was analyzed. Results: It was observed that the matrix of 100 meters (as the spatial unit) showed the highest efficiency to estimate the diseases. The best results were observed in the models that utilized the kernel density estimation (as the calculation of the dependent variable). In all models, the GWR method showed the best results. By considering the OLS coefficient values, it was observed that all geographical conditions are related to the incidence of Zika and Chiktmgunya, while the GWR coefficient values showed where this relationship was more noticeable. Conclusions: The model that utilized the combination of the matrix of 100 meters, kernel density estimation (as the calculation of the dependent variable) and GWR method showed the highest efficiency in estimating the spatial distribution of the diseases. The coefficient values showed that all analyzed geographical conditions are related to the illnesses' incidence.

TI  - Hand pollination under shade trees triples cocoa yield in Brazil's agroforests
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Agricultural diversification can enhance climate resilience, biodiversity conservation, and livelihood in global farming systems. Diverse agroforestry systems with cocoa have been shown to provide all these benefits, but the often-lower yields compared to monocultures limit agroforestry adoption by smallholder farmers. Cocoa yield is pollination-limited, and here, we quantified the effect of hand pollination in cocoa on fruit set, fruit abortion or cherelle wilt, pest and diseases, and number of mature fruits. Experiments were conducted in Bahia, Brazil, along a shade gradient from low [10-30%] to high [70-100%] canopy cover and with cocoa trees grafted with highyielding varieties. We found on average 331% fruit set, and 300% mature fruit increase (i.e. ripe pods) per tree by enhancing pollination by hand as little as 10% of the flowers/tree, compared to the control (i.e. with only natural pollination). Fruit set, fruit losses, and mature fruit development linked to hand pollination was higher in low compared to highly shaded cocoa areas. We found 31% higher fruit set and 37% higher number of mature fruits in grafted than un-grafted trees. Further, when comparing efforts invested in hand pollination, minimum labor (-5 min/tree to pollinate 10-30% of the flowers/tree) led to a 871% fruit set and a 750% mature fruit increase under low canopy cover, and intermediate labor (-15 min/tree to pollinate 40-60% flowers/tree) to a 629% fruit set under high canopy cover. As -5-15 min/tree hand pollination can substantially enhance fruit set and number of mature fruits in low as well as high shade management, we recommend performing hand pollination particularly in agroforests under 40-50% canopy cover to create win-win opportunities for high productivity and climate resilience. Future research should focus on the wide range of agroforestry, tree grafting and innovation strategies in all major production regions to capture the long-term variability of hand pollination as a basis to scale-up hand pollination for sustainable cocoa production globally.

TI  - Coral Reefs Threats and Conservation in an Era of Global Change
T2  - YEAR IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION BIOLOGY 2009
AB  - Coral reefs are iconic, threatened ecosystems that have been in existence for similar to 500 million years, yet their continued ecological persistence seems doubtful at present. Anthropogenic modification of chemical and physical atmospheric dynamics that cause coral death by bleaching and newly emergent diseases due to increased heat and irradiation, as well as decline in calcification caused by ocean acidification due to increased CO2, are the most important large-scale threats. On more local scales, overfishing and destructive fisheries, coastal construction, nutrient enrichment, increased runoff and sedimentation, and the introduction of nonindigenous invasive species have caused phase shifts away from corals. Already similar to 20% of the world's reefs are lost and similar to 26% are under imminent threat. Conservation science of coral reefs is well advanced, but its practical application has often been lagging. Societal priorites, economic pressures, and legal/administrative systems of many countries are more prone to destroy rather than conserve coral-reef ecosystems. Nevertheless, many examples of successful conservation exist from the national level to community-enforced local action. When effectively managed, protected areas have contributed to regeneration of coral reefs and stocks of associated marine resources. Local communities often support coral-reef conservation in order to raise income potential associated with tourism and/or improved resource levels. Coral reefs create an annual income in S-Florida alone of over $4 billion. Thus, no conflict between development, societal welfare, and coral-reef conservation needs to exist. Despite growing threats, it is not too late for decisive action to protect and save these economically and ecologically high-value ecosystems. Conservation science plays a critical role in designing effective strategies.

TI  - The use of a multilevel statistical model to analyze factors influencing land use: a study of the Ecuadorian Amazon
T2  - GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE
CP  - International Young Scientists Global Change Conference
AB  - This research introduces a novel application of a constrained multivariate response multilevel model of land use. Methodological objectives are (1) to examine the conceptual specification of a multilevel model of land use and (2) to incorporate constraints in multilevel model estimation to reflect the ipsative nature of land use as a response. The substantive objective is to demonstrate and report multilevel results from a representative sample of farm plots (fincas) in 1999 nested in 59 communities throughout the Northern Ecuadorian Amazon. Results indicate that population pressure, labor, and accessibility and proximity between households and communities are strong predictors of land use. Communities are seen to significantly influence land use at the finca level through unobserved and observed structural effects. We conclude with four recommendations to apply multilevel models: (1) consider alternative types of multilevel models to better match land use data distributions; (2) test and control for spatial autocorrelation; (3) collect the best data possible at higher levels; and (4) consider further integration of remotely sensed and household survey data using a multilevel framework.

TI  - A review of the genus Rickettsia in Central America
T2  - RESEARCH AND REPORTS IN TROPICAL MEDICINE
AB  - In this paper, we present a historical review of rickettsiosis in Central America and also the most recent findings of Rickettsia in ectoparasites. All countries of Central America have records of rickettsiosis. Regarding the typhus group rickettsioses, there is clinical or serological evidence of Rickettsia prowazekii in Guatemala, Rickettsia typhi in Panama, Guatemala, and Costa Rica and unidentified species of the typhus group in El Salvador. Concerning spotted fever group rickettsiosis, there is serological evidence of infection by Rickettsia akari in Costa Rica and confirmed cases involving Rickettsia rickettsii in Panama and Costa Rica. There are also reports of spotted fever group rickettsiosis in acute patients from Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua. Serological studies in Central America show reactivity of Rickettsia ambyommatis, Rickettsia bellii, Rickettsia felis, Rickettsia rhipicephali, and R. rickettsii in domestic and wild mammals. Eight species of Rickettsia have been detected in ectoparasites from Central America: R. africae (or very similar), R. amblyommatis, R. asembonensis, R. bellii, R. felis, R. parkeri, R. rhipicephali, and R. rickettsii, in addition to undescribed strains such as Atlantic Rainforest, Colombianensi, IbR/CRC, Barva, Aragaoi, and Candidatus "Rickettsia nicoyana;" the latter being the only one associated with Argasidae (Ornithodoros knoxjonesi). R. amblyommatis is the most common species in Central America, seeing as it has been reported in 10 species of ticks and one of fleas in five of the seven countries of the region. In this study, we demonstrate that the genus Rickettsia is widely distributed in Central America and that rickettsiosis could be an underestimated problem in the absence of greater diagnostic efforts in undetermined febrile cases.

TI  - "The mangrove preserves life": Habitat of African survival in the Atlantic world
T2  - GEOGRAPHICAL REVIEW
AB  - Mangroves emerged a crucial habitat for Africans and their descendants during the transatlantic slave trade. Europeans avoided mangroves because of the deadly fevers that frequently claimed the lives of those who ventured there. Many were felled by lethal falciparum malaria, against which Africans alone carried genetic resistance. The transatlantic slave trade spread the disease-causing plasmodium to New World Anopheles mosquitoes through infected bloodstreams, extending African mangroves' pestilential reputation to the Neotropics. On both sides of the Atlantic, an environment Europeans feared provided Africans food, basic necessities, and sometimes, refuge from slavery. In Neotropical mangroves Africans largely replaced declining Amerindian populations, who were also immunologically vulnerable to the introduced plasmodium. Today, African descendants in Old and New World mangroves demonstrate longstanding human use of this ecosystem. Comparison of shellfish gathering and gendered collection patterns in mangroves recognizes Amerindian and African influences in Neotropical mangroves and illuminates the connections to transatlantic diasporic history. The discussion considers how a more-than-human geography shaped place-based knowledge of mangrove swamplands that remained marginal to European territorializing during the colonial period. African and Afro-descendant place-making underscores the ways people, plants, insects, microbes, shellfish, and tides framed geography and diasporic identity at the periphery of the Atlantic world.

TI  - Patterns and drivers of Human Visceral Leishmaniasis in Pernambuco (Brazil) from 2007 to 2018
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is the second most common protozoosis that affects people around the world. The aim of this study is to understand how environmental and socioeconomic factors, as well as VL control and surveillance interventions, influence the spread and detection of VL cases in Pernambuco state (Brazil). A novel model was developed to analyze cases of VL between 2007 and 2018, enabling the quantification of the association of these variables with two processes: the probability of "invasion" (emergence of new cases) at municipalities by VL, and the probability of detecting cases not reported in municipalities that have already been invaded. Pernambuco state identified 1,410 cases of VL between 2007 and 2018, with an average of 128 cases per year and average incidence of 1.28/100 thousand people. These cases were distributed in 77.1% (142/184) of the municipalities, and 54.8% (773/1,410) of them were autochthonous. Our model reveals that the proportion of agriculture was positively associated with VL invasion probability. We also find that municipalities that are closer to notification centers and/or that have received technical training and support tend to have higher detection rates of VL cases. Taken together, these results suggest that a municipality with almost no agriculture and that received technical training, located close to a notification center, is unlikely to be invaded if no cases have ever been detected. On the other hand, a municipality that is far from the notification center, with no technical training, with a large agricultural area might have already been invaded but the surveillance system might have routinely failed to detect VL cases due to low detection probability. By disentangling the processes of invasion and detection, we were able to generate insights that are likely to be useful for the strategic allocation of VL prevention and control interventions.
   Author summaryVisceral leishmaniasis (VL) is an important neglected zoonosis around the world. We evaluated how environmental and socioeconomic factors, as well as VL control and surveillance interventions, influence the spread and detection of VL cases in Pernambuco state (Brazil), which is endemic. Our results reveal that municipalities with almost no agriculture that received technical training and are located close to a notification center are unlikely to have VL infected individuals if no cases have ever been detected. On the other hand, a municipality distant from the notification center, with no technical training, and with a large agricultural area might have already had unreported cases. These results can serve as a foundation to improve the personnel training and notification system strategies adopted by VL Public Health Programs.

Field captures were performed with CDC light traps between February and March 2003. A total of 436 sand flies were captured, belonging to 14 species. The predominant species (28.7%) was Lutzomyia ischnacantha Martins, Souza e Falcao, followed by L. renei (27,06%) and L. cavernicola (13,07%). The finding of L. intermedia, a species that is incriminated as vector of the cutaneous leishmaniasis, has to be taken into account.

TI  - Challenges to Human Papillomavirus Vaccine Acceptability among Women in South India: An Exploratory Study
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Cervical cancer is the second leading cause of cancer and one of the leading causes of cancer-related death in women in India. Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine uptake in India is low due to cost, low awareness of HPV, social stigma, and other factors. We assessed the awareness, attitudes, and beliefs regarding HPV and HPV vaccination and explored the barriers and challenges to HPV vaccine intent among women in Mangalore, India. An exploratory study was conducted using two focus group discussions (FGDs) and six in-depth one-on-one interviews. FGD-1 comprised nine women aged 18 to 26 years, and FGD-2 comprised seven women aged 27 to 45 years. The FGDs were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic content analysis. Themes identified were limited knowledge of HPV and vaccine, stigma associated with receiving HPV vaccine, vaccine safety concerns, and cost as a barrier to receiving vaccine. Participants expressed desire for physician and government recommendation of the HPV vaccine to validate vaccine intent. Contrasting themes between the two FGDs include support for vaccination at a younger age and lower perception of stigma and judgment in the 18-to 26-year-old group; however, participants in the 27-to 45-year-old group support vaccination at an older age and endorse greater fear of stigma and judgment associated with obtaining vaccination. Education regarding HPV-associated diseases and the HPV vaccine for the general public, physicians, and government officials in conjunction with lowering vaccine cost, improving vaccine access, and encouraging strong physician recommendations are key strategies to scale up HPV vaccine implementation in India.

TI  - TEMPORAL VARIATION IN BIRD AND RESOURCE ABUNDANCE ACROSS AN ELEVATIONAL GRADIENT IN HAWAII
T2  - AUK
AB  - We documented patterns of nectar availability and nectarivorous bird abundance over similar to 3 years at nine study sites across an 1,800-m elevational gradient on Hawaii Island to investigate the relationship between resource variation and bird abundance. Flower density (flowers ha(-1)) and nectar energy content were measured across the gradient for the monodominant 'Ohi'a (Metrosideros polymorpha). Four nectarivorous bird species were captured monthly in mist nets and surveyed quarterly with point-transect distance sampling at each site to examine patterns of density and relative abundance. Flowering peaks were associated with season but not rainfall or elevation. Bird densities peaked in the winter and spring of each year at high elevations, but patterns were less clear at middle and low elevations. Variability in bird abundance was generally best modeled as a function of elevation, season, and flower density, but the strength of the latter effect varied with species. The low elevations had the greatest density of flowers but contained far fewer individuals of the two most strongly nectarivorous species. There is little evidence of large-scale altitudinal movement of birds in response to 'Ohi'a flowering peaks. The loose relationship between nectar and bird abundance may be explained by a number of potential mechanisms, including (1) demographic constraints to movement; (2) nonlimiting nectar resources; and (3) the presence of an "ecological trap," whereby birds are attracted by the high resource abundance of, but suffer increased mortality at, middle and low elevations as a result of disease.

T2  - STUDIES ON NEOTROPICAL FAUNA AND ENVIRONMENT
AB  - A study of the phlebotomine sand fly fauna was carried out in the Rio Preto State Park (Minas Gerais, Brazil) aiming to associate the presence of vector species with the risk of leishmaniasis transmission in that region. Sand flies were captured using HP light traps for four months from January to October 2013. The traps were exposed continuously for 40h each month, in nine fixed sites. A total of 3129 sand flies were captured, belonging to 19 species. Lutzomyia evandroi (Costa Lima & Antunes 1936) was the predominant species (76.48%). The distribution of the phlebotomine sand flies and climatic factors (temperature, humidity, and rainfall) was evaluated. The summer was the season with higher occurrence of insects captured (82.4%). The presence of cutaneous and visceral vector species in park areas requires attention and regular monitoring of sand fly fauna in this conservation area to ensure the well-being of visitors and the regional ecotourism.

TI  - Daily survival rates and dispersal of <i>Aedes aegypti</i> females in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Daily survival rates, life expectancy, dispersal, and parity are important components of vectorial capacity of Aedes aegypti. These parameters were estimated for mosquito populations from a slum and a suburban district in Rio de Janeiro, during the wet and dry seasons in 2005. In each mark-release-recapture experiment, three cohorts of dust-marked Ae. aegypti females were released. Recaptures were carried out daily in randomly selected houses, using backpack aspirators, adult traps, and sticky ovitraps. Recapture varied between 6.81% and 14.26%. Daily survival was estimated by fitting two alternative models: exponential and nonlinear models with correction for the removal of individuals. Slum area presented higher survival and parity rates (68.5%). Dispersal rates were higher in the suburban area, where a maximum dispersal of 363 m was observed. Results suggest intense risk of dengue epidemic, particularly in the urban area.

TI  - Development of DNA barcode-based PCR methodology to distinguish two sympatric species viz. <i>Phlebotomus argentipes</i> and <i>Phlebotomus colabaensis</i> (Diptera: Psychodidae: Phlebotominae)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TROPICAL INSECT SCIENCE
AB  - Phlebotomus argentipes and Phlebotomus colabaensis are the two sandfly species prevalent in the Western Ghats region of Kerala. P. argentipes had been incriminated as the vector of leishmaniasis in this region. The similar taxonomic features shared by these two species of sandflies had made it difficult to distinguish the adults morphologically. DNA barcoding is an efficient molecular diagnostic method utilized to identify the closely related species. In the present study, we designed species specific DNA primers from the DNA barcode sequences of P. argentipes and P. colabaensis. A semi nested PCR was performed with a consensus forward primer and two different reverse primers which could amplify specific DNA fragments for these two different sandflies. An amplified PCR product of 465 bp indicated P. argentipes and 401 bp, P. colabaensis. This species-specific PCR assay can be utilized to identify and distinguish two common Phlebotomus species with a single-step multiplex PCR.

TI  - Evaluation of a simple, rapid and field-adapted diagnostic assay for enterotoxigenic <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> and <i>Shigella</i>
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Understanding the global burden of enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) and Shigella diarrhea as well as estimating the cost effectiveness of vaccines to control these two significant pathogens have been hindered by the lack of a diagnostic test that is rapid, simple, sensitive, and can be applied to the endemic countries. We previously developed a simple and rapid assay, Rapid Loop mediated isothermal amplification based Diagnostic Test (RLDT) for the detection of ETEC and Shigella spp. (Shigella). In this study, the RLDT assay was evaluated in comparison with quantitative PCR (qPCR), culture and conventional PCR for the detection of ETEC and Shigella. This validation was performed using previously collected stool samples from endemic countries, from the travelers to the endemic countries, as well as samples from a controlled human infection model study of ETEC. The performance of RLDT from dried stool spots was also validated. RLDT resulted in excellent sensitivity and specificity compared to qPCR (99% and 99.2% respectively) ranging from 92.3 to 100% for the individual toxin genes of ETEC and 100% for Shigella. Culture was less sensitive compared to RLDT. No significant differences were noted in the performance of RLDT using samples from various sources or stool samples from moderate to severe diarrhea or asymptomatic infections. RLDT performed equally well in detection of ETEC and Shigella from the dried stool samples on filter papers. This study established that RLDT is sufficiently sensitive and specific to be used as a simple and rapid diagnostic assay to detect ETEC and Shigella in endemic countries to determine disease burden of these pathogens in the national and subnational levels. This information will be important to guide public health and policy makers to prioritize resources for accelerating the development and introduction of effective preventative and/or treatment interventions against these enteric infections.
   Author summary
   Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) and Shigella spp (Shigella) causes significant global morbidity and mortality, especially in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). Since culture methods to detect Shigella are not sensitive, and the methods used to detect ETEC have not been feasible outside of specialized, well-equipped laboratories, the true burden of these pathogens at national and sub-national levels are mostly not available. Morbidity and mortality estimates, for these two pathogens are crucial to assess their relative public health importance in LMICs. We developed a simple and rapid diagnostic assay called the RLDT (Rapid Loop-mediated isothermal amplification based Diagnostic Test) for detection of ETEC and Shigella. In this study we evaluated RLDT compared to other currently available assays using previously collected stool samples. Our data showed that the RLDT assay exhibited high sensitivity and specificity for detection of ETEC and Shigella, with its result available within 50 minutes. The sensitivity of RLDT was higher than culture for these pathogens. We conclude that RLDT could be used as a rapid and simple diagnostic test to determine the burden of ETEC and Shigella in LMICs as well as in clinical vaccine trials of these pathogens.

TI  - The relevance of ants as seed rescuers of a primarily bird-dispersed tree in the Neotropical cerrado savanna
T2  - OECOLOGIA
AB  - The scale at which seed dispersal operates has many implications for the spatial patterns of plant recruitment and diversity. We investigated the effect of short- (ants) and long-distance (birds) seed dispersal of the fleshy-fruited melastome, Miconia rubiginosa, in the Brazilian savanna. We estimated the contribution of dispersal vectors to the removal of the fruit crop from the canopy (birds), and once seeds have reached the cerrado floor (ants) over two fruiting seasons. Birds (13 species) removed up to 23.7% of the fruit crop from the crown, but dropped a substantial proportion of fruits beneath the parent plant. Birds removed a greater proportion of fruits from trees producing large fruit crops, as predicted by the fruit crop size hypothesis. However, up to 18.9% of the fruit crop fell beneath the parent plant as ripe fruit. Most fallen fruits were removed by ants (seven genera), which are likely to play a relatively important role in terms of the quantity of seeds dispersed, especially for plants producing small fruit crops (a conceptual model is presented). Birds and ants did not influence seed germination, but they differ in terms of the spatial scale of dispersal and deposition patterns. Ants probably play an important role in the local population dynamics of Miconia, whereas birds are responsible for long-distance dispersal associated with the colonization of new patches and metapopulation dynamics. By removing seeds from bird droppings, ants may also reshape at a finer scale the seed rain generated by primary dispersers. Indeed, seedlings and saplings of Miconia are more frequently found around leaf-cutter ant nests than in control areas away from ant nests or around large Miconia trees. The quantitative component of dispersal effectiveness by ants acting as "rescuers" of seeds that fail to be dispersed, or fall under parent trees, is probably more important than currently recognized in other systems.

TI  - Lessons from the Incursion of Myrtle Rust in Australia
T2  - ANNUAL REVIEW OF PHYTOPATHOLOGY, VOL 56
AB  - Austropuccinia psidii (myrtle rust) is a globally invasive neotropical rust of the Myrtaceae that came into international prominence following extensive damage to exotic Eucalyptus plantations in Brazil in the 1970s and 1980s. In 2005, myrtle rust established in Hawaii (USA), and over the past 12 years has spread from the Americas into Asia, the Pacific, and South Africa. Myrtle rust was detected in Australia in 2010, and the response and ultimately unsuccessful eradication attempt was a lesson to those concerned about the threat of exotic pests and diseases to Australia's environment. Seven years following establishment, we are already observing the decline of many myrtaceous species and severe impacts to native plant communities. However, the recently developed Myrtle rust in Australia draft action plan identified that there is no nationally coordinated response strategy for the environmental dimensions of this threat. Recent reviews have identified a greater need for involvement from environmental agencies in biosecurity preparedness, response, and resourcing, and we believe this approach needs to extend to the management of invasive environmental pathogens once they establish.

TI  - The influence of soil moisture on losses of buried seeds to fungi
T2  - ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
AB  - Although soil fungi are likely to be a major cause of mortality for buried seeds, few ecological studies have examined the role these pathogens play in natural systems. In particular, few studies have investigated whether losses of seeds to soil fungi are habitat-dependent. We used fungicide treatments to investigate whether losses of buried seeds of four grasses (Bromus inermis, Danthonia spicata, Glyceria striata, and Poa pratensis) to soil fungi differed among meadows differing in soil moisture. We also applied water to some treatments, to determine whether this increased losses of seeds to fungi. For all four grasses, fungicide additions improved one or more measures of seed viability, though this effect was small. For Danthonia and Glyceria, fungicide was less likely to improve viability in dry meadows than in wet and/or mesic meadows. Adding water reduced some measures of viability of seeds of Danthonia and Poa in dry meadows, but fungicide partly counteracted these negative effects, suggesting that adding water reduced performance by increasing fungal attack. These results indicate that fungi represent a hazard for buried seeds of these species, particularly in wetter soils, and potentially may contribute to the reduction of populations of vulnerable species in wetter sites.

TI  - Birds and ants provide complementary seed dispersal in a neotropical savanna
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
AB  - P>1. A substantial portion of the crop of fruiting trees falls beneath parent plants as a result of dispersal failure. Such diaspores are considered as waste because the likelihood of plant recruitment is usually very small close to parent trees. However, many animals may rescue fallen diaspores and provide them with another chance of dispersal and establishment.
   2. We investigated the effectiveness of two broad types of seed dispersal vectors for the regeneration of Xylopia aromatica in the Brazilian cerrado savanna: birds that remove diaspores from plant canopies and ants that harvest diaspores on the ground under the parent plant (as rescuers) or from bird feces (as secondary dispersers).
   3. Birds removed a mean of 32% of the crop from plant canopies, but removal was independent of crop size. A large part of the crop (mean of 25%) landed beneath parent plants or was dropped after manipulation by vertebrate frugivores as viable diaspores. Ants from at least five genera removed most fallen diaspores (up to 83%) within 24 h. Ants influenced the fate of a large amount of the crop, and for some trees ants removed as many diaspores as birds.
   4. Large ants rescued some diaspores to distances beyond the parent plant crown, but birds may remove diaspores 40-fold farther. However, seedlings of X. aromatica were only found close to nests of large ants, probably due to diaspore rescuing and/or directed secondary dispersal by certain ant groups following primary dispersal by birds. Although an unknown percentage of seeds was lost to granivorous ants, diaspore removal by ants potentially enhances the likelihood of plant recruitment due to distance-related benefits and directed dispersal to ant nests, while birds play a premier role in long-distance seed dispersal and metapopulation dynamics.
   5. Synthesis. Birds and ants provide complementary seed dispersal at different spatial scales to X. aromatica. Since ants remove most fallen diaspores beneath parent plants, the use of diaspore removal rates from plant canopy as a surrogate of plant fitness may be misleading. By acting as secondary dispersers, ants may also provide a fine-tuned dispersal following long-distance dispersal by birds (i.e. diplochory).

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TROPICAL INSECT SCIENCE
AB  - Culex mosquitoes are important vectors of various pathogens to both humans and animals. The present study describes a new species to science as Culex (Culex) kodaikanalensis Suman, Veer and Chandra sp. nov. based on morphology, morphometrics of adult females and mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I and 16S rRNA genes. This species, Cx. kodaikanalensis, belongs to Mimeticus subgroup of Culex genus represented by banded or spotted wings. It can be identified with the absence of longitudinal pale stripes on anterior surface of all tibiae and presence of pale spot on furcation of both R and M veins. In addition, the length of pale spots on R4+5 (0.18 to 0.9) and Anal (0.1 to 0.5) veins of Cx. kodaikanalensis also differ from other species of the subgroup. The mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (562 bp) and 16S rRNA (539 bp) gene sequences of Cx. kodaikanalensis established the close affinity with Mimeticus subgroup species in comparison to other culicine species being the closest to Culex gaugleri. These pieces of evidence confirm the status of Cx. kodaikanalensis as an individual species. Culex kodaikanalensis is prevalent at high altitudes (> 1500 m) of Kodaikanal hills in Tamil Nadu, India. The prevalence of the larval habitats near the residential areas suggests further studies on host feeding behaviour of the species.

TI  - Using natural marks to estimate free-ranging dog <i>Canis familiaris</i> abundance in a MARK-RESIGHT framework in suburban Mumbai, India
T2  - TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE
AB  - Free-ranging dogs (Canis familiaris) are a major conservation issue in the tropics and adopt many ecological roles, alternatively functioning as predators, prey, or competitors of wildlife in diverse environments. Dogs are also potential reservoirs of disease that can be transmitted to both wildlife and people. Therefore a range of management interventions have been suggested to control dog populations. In order to monitor interventions to decrease dog populations, estimates of their population size are important and such methods need to be time-and cost-effective. We describe here a potential method that uses natural marks on dogs along with counts of non-marked individuals in a mark-resight framework to estimate the abundance of free-ranging dogs in a suburban area in India. Using the logit-normal mixed effects estimator to incorporate the effects of individual resighting heterogeneity, we found a total (N-j) of 680.64 +/- 34.06 (95% CI = 617.22 - 751.35) dogs in the study area, with an overall mean resighting probability of 0.53 +/- 0.03 (95% CI = 0.47 - 0.58). This corresponds to a density estimate of 57 dogs km(-2) (CI = 51 - 63). Given that certain assumptions are met, this method may be useful to estimate abundance of dogs where other kinds of marks may be unavailable or impractical. This method may be applied to other species of feral animals as well, where some proportion of a population has distinct natural marks.

TI  - Bioclimatic distribution and prevalence maps for <i>Fasciola hepatica</i> in Espirito Santo State, Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF VENOMOUS ANIMALS AND TOXINS INCLUDING TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background: Fasciolosis affects different ruminant species and leads to great economic losses for cattle farmers worldwide. Thus, the current study aimed to evaluate bovine fasciolosis prevalence in the state of Espirito Santo, Brazil, using slaughter maps provided by slaughterhouses and verifying the origin of cattle.
   Methods: A map was created based on analysis of epidemiological data. The ArcGIS/ArcINFO 10.1 software was employed in order to elaborate updated bioclimatic maps that displayed the fasciolosis prevalence within the state per city-between 2009 and 2011.
   Results: According to the bioclimatic map it was clear that 52.24% of the state's total area comprise regions considered favorable for the development and survival of Fasciola hepatica. According to the data provided by slaughterhouses, the parasite was more frequent in the cities of Atilio Vivacqua, Itapemirim and Anchieta with respective prevalence of 28.41, 25.50 and 24.95%. Although the northern portion of the state is also favorable for the disease maintenance (reaching rates above 90%), several cities presented prevalence of only 0.99 and 1.94% respectively. These findings indicate that climatic and environmental factors only cannot be considered preponderant to fasciolosis occurrence. Regarding the slaughterhouse located in Anchieta city, the higher prevalence was registered in the cities of Jeronimo Monteiro, Alegre and Cachoeiro de Itapemirim, with mean prevalence of 1.21, 1.07 and 2.09% respectively.
   Conclusion: Although the present findings suggest a pattern for the prevalence of fasciolosis, records of the cities for the occurrence of the disease usually do not reflect the true origin of animals.

TI  - Detection of Antibodies to Spotted Fever Group Rickettsiae and Arboviral Coinfections in Febrile Individuals in 2014-2015 in Southern Coastal Ecuador
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Tick-borne diseases (TBDs) are a growing public health threat and are increasingly identified as the cause of undifferentiated febrile illness. There is a significant gap in our understanding of ticks and their associated pathogens in Ecuador. An arboviral surveillance study allowed us to explore potential exposure to TBDs in febrile subjects. We tested plasma samples from 222 febrile subjects for spotted fever group rickettsial (SFGR) antibodies from southern coastal Ecuador in 2014-2015 via ELISA. Fifty-five (25%) subjects had evidence of anti-SFRG IgG or IgM antibodies. Although attempts to detect Rickettsia species in plasma by polymerase chain reaction were unsuccessful, these preliminary data suggest the possibility of endemic SFGR transmission in Ecuador. To better understand the burden and entomological risk for TBDs in Ecuador, future studies should expand TBD surveillance in humans, document common human-biting ticks, and measure pathogen carriage rates in questing ticks.

TI  - Association of Sickle Cell Trait with Risk and Mortality of COVID-19: Results from the United Kingdom Biobank
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Sickle cell trait (SCT) carriers inherit one copy of the Glu6Val mutation in the hemoglobin gene and is particularly common in Black individuals (5-10%). Considering the roles of hemoglobin in immune responses and the higher risk for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) among Black individuals, we tested whether Black SCT carriers were at increased risk for COVID-19 infection and mortality according to the United Kingdom Biobank. Among Black individuals who were tested for COVID-19, we found similar infection rates among SCT carriers (14/72; 19.7%) and noncarriers (167/791; 21.1%), but higher COVID-19 mortality rates among SCT carriers (4/14; 28.6%) than among noncarriers (21/167; 12.6%) (odds ratio [OR], 3.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.69-11.82; P = 0.12). Notably, SCT carriers with preexisting diabetes had significantly higher COVID-19 mortality (4/4; 100%) than those without diabetes (0/10; 0%; (OR, 90.71; 95% CI, 5.66-infinite; P = 0.0005). These findings suggest that Black SCT carriers with preexisting diabetes are at disproportionally higher risk for COVID-19 mortality. Confirmation by larger studies is warranted.

TI  - Distinct life history strategies underpin clear patterns of succession in microparasite communities infecting a wild mammalian host
T2  - MOLECULAR ECOLOGY
AB  - Individual animals in natural populations tend to host diverse parasite species concurrently over their lifetimes. In free-living ecological communities, organismal life histories shape interactions with their environment, which ultimately forms the basis of ecological succession. However, the structure and dynamics of mammalian parasite communities have not been contextualized in terms of primary ecological succession, in part because few datasets track occupancy and abundance of multiple parasites in wild hosts starting at birth. Here, we studied community dynamics of 12 subtypes of protozoan microparasites (Theileria spp.) in a herd of African buffalo. We show that Theileria communities followed predictable patterns of succession underpinned by four different parasite life history strategies. However, in contrast to many free-living communities, network complexity decreased with host age. Examining parasite communities through the lens of succession may better inform the effect of complex within host eco-evolutionary dynamics on infection outcomes, including parasite co-existence through the lifetime of the host.

TI  - Cropping system diversification for food production in Mindanao rubber plantations: a rice cultivar mixture and rice intercropped with mungbean
T2  - PEERJ
AB  - Including food production in non-food systems, such as rubber plantations and biofuel or bioenergy crops, may contribute to household food security. We evaluated the potential for planting rice, mungbean, rice cultivar mixtures, and rice intercropped with mungbean in young rubber plantations in experiments in the Arakan Valley of Mindanao in the Philippines. Rice mixtures consisted of two- or three-row strips of cultivar Dinorado, a cultivar with higher value but lower yield, and high-yielding cultivar UPL Ri-5. Rice and mungbean intercropping treatments consisted of different combinations of two- or three-row strips of rice and mungbean. We used generalized linear mixed models to evaluate the yield of each crop alone and in the mixture or intercropping treatments. We also evaluated a land equivalent ratio for yield, along with weed biomass (where Ageratum conyzoides was particularly abundant), the severity of disease caused by Magnaporthe oryzae and Cochliobolus miyabeanus, and rice bug (Leptocorisa acuta) abundance. We analyzed the yield ranking of each cropping system across site-year combinations to determine mean relative performance and yield stability. When weighted by their relative economic value, UPL Ri-5 had the highest mean performance, but with decreasing performance in low-yielding environments. A rice and mungbean intercropping system had the second highest performance, tied with high-value Dinorado but without decreasing relative performance in low-yielding environments. Rice and mungbean intercropped with rubber have been adopted by farmers in the Arakan Valley.

TI  - Demographic, dispersal, predation and genetic data reveal the potential vulnerability of an endangered rainforest shrub, <i>Triunia robusta</i> (Proteaceae)
T2  - AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
AB  - We investigated the population ecology of Triunia robusta (C.T. White) Foreman, an endemic rainforest shrub of south-east Queensland, Australia. Two-time demographic data from 1999 and 2010 were used to estimate the species life span and changes in demographic factors over the 11 year period. The potential dispersal vectors and their activities were monitored, and the effects of predation on seed and seedling mortality were quantified. Published genetic data was used to assess the gene flow distance in years. On average, T. robusta has a life span of 103 years, with a generation time of 44 years. Larger populations (>200) increased in size since 1999, whereas smaller populations retained the same or slightly reduced numbers. Small, isolated populations in the northern distribution range showed substantially lower reproductive rates. Local rodents and marsupials were considered responsible for the majority of observed secondary seed dispersal (<10.3m) and predation activities. Post-predation mortality was high (82%), with only 12% surviving to become seedlings. The empirical evidence of short-distance dispersal, limited gene flow, high post-predation mortality rates and relatively low reproductive rates, combined with potential absence of primary dispersers suggests that critically small and isolated populations may be highly vulnerable.

TI  - Differential Effects of Unusual Climatic Stress on Capuchin (<i>Cebus</i> <i>capucinus</i>) and Howler Monkey (<i>Alouatta palliata</i>) Populations on Barro Colorado Island, Panama
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY
AB  - Though the harmful effects anthropogenic disturbances pose to wild primates are well appreciated, comparatively little is known about the effects of natural disturbances. From December 2010 to January 2011, different mortality patterns were observed for two primate species, capuchins and howler monkeys, on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama. Unusually high rainfall in 2010 was associated with census and cadaver data indicating the rapid loss of >70% of the capuchin population in late 2010 to early 2011. In contrast, over this same period, no decline was documented for howler monkeys and cadaver data for howlers was unexceptional. The high mortality experienced by the capuchin population was unexpected and its extent was not fully appreciated until the event was largely over. Explanations proposed for it included effects of hypothermia, disease or a shortage of some essential nutrient(s). Of these, the dietary explanation seems most probable. BCI capuchins depend most heavily on arthropod foods in December, when few higher quality ripe fruits are available. The unprecedented high rainfall in December 2010 is hypothesized to have largely eliminated the arthropod peak expected on BCI each December. A lack of protein-rich arthropods, when coupled with the climatic and nutritional stress capuchins generally experience at this time of year, appears to have precipitated the rapid die-off of most of the island's capuchin population. As howler monkeys obtain dietary protein primarily from leaves, a shortage of edible arthropods would not affect howler numbers. Comparison of our 2010 data with similar data on earlier primate/mammalian mortality events reported for BCI and for Corcovado, Costa Rica indicates that our understanding of the effects of natural disturbances on wild primate populations is not profound. We suggest that more research be devoted to this increasingly timely topic, so important to conservation policy. Am. J. Primatol. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - Larvicidal activity of plants from Myrtaceae against <i>Aedes aegypti</i> L. and <i>Simulium pertinax</i> Kollar (Diptera)
T2  - REVISTA DA SOCIEDADE BRASILEIRA DE MEDICINA TROPICAL
AB  - Introduction: Despite their widespread usage, synthetic insecticides and larvicides are harmful for controlling disease-causing mosquitoes owing to the development of resistance. The leaves of Eugenia astringens, Myrrhinium atropurpureum, and Neomitranthes obscura were collected from Marambaia and Grumari restingas. The safety and larvicidal efficacy of their extracts were tested against Aedes (Stegomyia) aegypti L. and Simulium (Chirostilbia) pertinax Kollar. Methods: The dry leaves were subjected to static maceration extraction using 90% methanol. A. aegypti and S. pertinax larvae were exposed to 7.5, 12.5, and 25.0 mu L/mL of the extracts (n= 30). The larvicidal activity after 24 h and 48 h, and the mortality, were determined. The median lethal concentration (CL 50) was estimated by a Finney's probit model. Results: M. atropurpureum and E. astringens extracts exhibited the strongest larvicidal effects against A. aegypti. M. atropurpureum extracts (25 mu L/mL) caused mortalities of over 50% and 100% after 24 h and 48 h, respectively (CL50 = 11.10 and 9.68 ppm, respectively). E. astringens extracts (25 mu L/mL) caused mortalities of 50% and 63.33% after 24 h and 48 h, respectively. High concentrations of N. obscura extracts induced a maximum mortality of 46.66% in A. aegypti larvae after 48 h (CL50 = 25 ppm). The larvae of S. pertinax showed 100% mortality following exposure to all the plant extracts at all the tested concentrations after 24 h. Conclusions: The extracts of M. atropurpuerum exhibited the strongest larvicidal activity against A. aegypti. The larvae of S. pertinax were sensitive to all the extracts at all the tested concentrations.

TI  - Aqueous extract of freeze-dried <i>Protaetia brevitarsis</i> larvae promotes osteogenesis by activating β-catenin signaling
T2  - ASIAN PACIFIC JOURNAL OF TROPICAL BIOMEDICINE
AB  - Objective: To investigate the effect of an aqueous extract of Protaetia brevitarsis (AEPB) on osteogenesis using preosteoblast MC3T3-E1 cells and zebrafish larvae.
   Methods: Flow cytometric analysis was used to measure the cytotoxicy. Alkaline phosphatase activity was detetmined using p-nitrophenyl phosphate as a substrate. Calcium deposition was detected using alizarin red staining along with osteogenic marker expression in preosteoblast MC3T3E1 cells. In addition, vertebral formation in zebrafish larvae was detected using calcein staining and osteogenic gene expression.
   Results: AEPB highly promoted the expression of osteogenic markers including runt-related transcription factor 2, osterix, and alkaline phosphatase, along with elevated levels of mineralization in MC3T3-E1 cells. Moreover, AEPB accelerated vertebral formation in zebrafish larvae accompanied by upregulated expression of osteogenic genes. FH535, an inhibitor of Wnt/beta-catenin, suppressed AEPB-induced osteogenic gene expression and vertebral formation, indicating that AEPB stimulates osteogenesis by activating the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway.
   Conclusions: AEPB stimulates osteoblast differentiation and bone formation by activating beta-catenin. Therefore, AEPB is a promising material that induces osteogenesis, and is useful for the treatment of bone resorption diseases.

TI  - Relative importance of host environment, transmission potential and host phylogeny to the structure of parasite metacommunities
T2  - OIKOS
AB  - Identification of mechanisms that shape parasite community and metacommunity structures have important implications to host health, disease transmission, and the understanding of community assembly in general. Using a long-term dataset on parasites from desert rodents, we examined the relative contributions of host traits that represent important aspects of parasite environment, transmission probability between host species, and host phylogeny to the structure of a parasite metacommunity as well as for taxonomically restricted parasite metacommunities (coccidians, ectoparasites and helminths). This was done using a combination of metacommunity analysis and variance partitioning based on canonical correspondence analysis. Coccidian and ectoparasite metacommunities did not exhibit coherent structure. In contrast, helminths and the full parasite metacommunity had Clementsian and quasi-Clementsian structure, respectively, indicating that parasite species distributions for these metacommunities were compartmentalized along a dominant gradient. Variance decomposition indicated that characteristics associated with the host environment consistently explained more variation than did host traits associated with transmission opportunities or host phylogeny, indicating that the host environment is primary in shaping parasite species distributions among host species. Moreover, the importance of different types of host traits in structuring parasite metacommunities was consistent among taxonomic groups (i.e. full metacommunity, coccidians, and helminths) despite manifest differences in emergent structures (i.e. Clementsian, quasi-Clementsian, and random) that arose in response to variation in host environment.

TI  - Systematics of the <i>Trichoderma harzianum</i> species complex and the re-identification of commercial biocontrol strains
T2  - MYCOLOGIA
AB  - Trichoderma harzianum is known as a cosmopolitan, ubiquitous species associated with a wide variety of substrates. It is possibly the most commonly used name in agricultural applications involving Trichoderma, including biological control of plant diseases. While various studies have suggested that T. harzianum is a species complex, only a few cryptic species are named. In the present study the taxonomy of the T. harzianum species complex is revised to include at least 14 species. Previously named species included in the complex are T. guizhouense, T. harzianum, and T. inhamatum. Two new combinations are proposed, T. lentiforme and T. lixii. Nine species are described as new, T. afarasin, T. afroharzianum, T. atrobrunneum, T. camerunense, T. endophyticum, T. neotropicale, T. pyramidale, T. rifaii and T. simmonsii. We isolated Trichoderma cultures from four commercial biocontrol products reported to contain T. harzianum. None of the biocontrol strains were identified as T. harzianum s. str. In addition, the widely applied culture 'T. harzianum T22' was determined to be T. afroharzianum. Some species in the T. harzianum complex appear to be exclusively endophytic, while others were only isolated from soil. Sexual states are rare. Descriptions and illustrations are provided. A secondary barcode, nuc translation elongation factor 1-alpha (TEF1) is needed to identify species in this complex.

TI  - Are Geckos Paratenic Hosts for Caribbean Island Acanthocephalans? Evidence from <i>Gonatodes antillensis</i> and a Global Review of Squamate Reptiles Acting as Transport Hosts
T2  - BULLETIN OF THE PEABODY MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY
AB  - It is well known that reptiles can act as paratenic hosts for parasites that use mammals as their definitive hosts. However, studies of potential paratenic hosts in the Caribbean have been temporally restricted to only diurnal species of lizards, thereby neglecting a dominant component of the nocturnal reptilian community: geckos. Many gecko species are human commensals with activity periods that overlap temporally with those of domestic cats, making them prime candidates as potential transport hosts for cat parasites. However, no studies have reported geckos as paratenic hosts for fetid parasites on any Caribbean island. Here we report the first records of subcutaneous oligacanthorhynchid cystacanths on the Venezuelan Coastal Clawed Gecko (Gonatodes antillensis) based on specimens collected in Curacao and Bonaire. The cysts were identified as belonging to the genus Oncicola, likely those of Oncicola venezuelensis. This study reports these geckos as a new host record for oligacanthorhynchid cystacanths, as well as Curacao and Bonaire as new geographic locales for these acanthocephalan parasites. We additionally provide a review of saurian cystacanths, comparing the restricted taxonomic focus of transport hosts in Caribbean islands to the distribution of paratenic squamate hosts both in the Neotropics and globally. We find evidence that the ability of squamate reptiles to act as transport hosts is a pervasive feature across their Tree of Life, suggesting that these animals may serve as important vectors for transporting parasites between intermediate and definitive hosts.

TI  - Definitions and Standardization of a New Grading Scheme for Eyelid Contour Abnormalities after Trichiasis Surgery
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background: Clear definitions of outcomes following trichiasis surgery are critical for planning program evaluations and for identifying ways to improve trichiasis surgery. Eyelid contour abnormality is an important adverse outcome of surgery; however, no standard method has been described to categorize eyelid contour abnormalities.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: A classification system for eyelid contour abnormalities following surgery for trachomatous trichiasis was developed. To determine whether the grading was reproducible using the classification system, six-week postoperative photographs were reviewed by two senior graders to characterize severity of contour abnormalities. Sample photographs defining each contour abnormality category were compiled and used to train four new graders. All six graders independently graded a Standardization Set of 75 eyelids, which included a roughly equal distribution across the severity scale, and weighted kappa scores were calculated. Two hundred forty six-week postoperative photographs from an ongoing clinical trial were randomly selected for evaluating agreement across graders. Two months after initial grading, one grader regraded a subset of the 240 photographs to measure longer-term intra-observer agreement. The weighted kappa for agreement between the two senior graders was 0.80 (95% CI: 0.71-0.89). Among the Standardization Set, agreement between the senior graders and the 4 new graders showed weighted kappa scores ranging from 0.60-0.80. Among 240 eyes comprising the clinical trial dataset, agreement ranged from weighted kappa 0.70-0.71. Longer-term intra-observer agreement was weighted kappa 0.86 (95% CI: 0.80-0.92).
   Conclusions/Significance: The standard eyelid contour grading system we developed reproducibly delineates differing levels of contour abnormality. This grading system could be useful both for helping to evaluate trichiasis surgery outcomes in clinical trials and for evaluating trichiasis surgery programs.

TI  - ANTIMICROBIAL ACTIVITY OF THE EXTRACT OF <i>ZANTHOXYLUM RHETSA</i> FRUIT AGAINST ORAL PATHOGENS
T2  - SOUTHEAST ASIAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Oral disease causing by gram-positive cocci and yeast is a major public health problem. In this study we aimed to investigate the antimicrobial activity of the extract of Zanthoxylum rhetsa fruit against Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175, Streptococcus pyogenes ATCC 19615, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) DMST 20651 and Candida albicans ATCC 90028 in order to potemtially develop it as an antimicrobial agent. We assessed the antimicrobial activity of the studied extract by evaluation the zone of inhibition using the disc diffusion method and the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal microbicidal concentration (MMC) using the broth micro-dilution method. We also aimed to determine the phytochemical compounds in the studied extract using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Two studied extracts were tested. These were obtained by macerating the fruit and extracting it with either 50% or 95% ethanol and the decoction in water. The 50% extract gave inhibition zones of 11-13 mm and MICs of 0.078-1.25 mg/ml and MMCs of 0.313-5 mg/ml. The 95% extract gave inhibition zones of 7-9 mm and MICs of 0.313-5 mg/ml and MMCs of 1.25 to more than 5 mg/ml. The studied extract was comprised primarily of monoterpenes: limonene epoxide (28.9%), limonene oxide (9.8%), cis-carveol (7.7%), delta-terpinene (4.6%), p-cymene (3.2%) and terpinene-4-ol (2.6%). The 50% ethanolic extract of Zanthoxylum rhetsa fruit had antimicrobial activity against the studied oral pathogens. Further studies are needed to determine its potential for clinical use in treating the studied pathogens.

This spatial template of related individuals sets the stage for all subsequent density-dependent and frequency-dependent interactions. In this study we document how ant-mediated seed dispersal affects the number and relatedness of seeds in both dispersed and undispersed aggregations and how these patterns influence seedling emergence in the long-lived perennial, Trillium grandiflorum. Experimental hand-pollinations in two years demonstrated that selfing is extremely rare and suggested that self-incompatibility (SI) is a likely explanation. Our multi-locus outcrossing estimate (t(m) =1.05 +/- 0.056) confirms this result and also suggests that seeds within a fruit are likely to have the same pollen parent. Thus a highly outcrossing mating system is the initial determinant of relatedness among seeds within a fruit. We tracked uniquely coded, radiolabeled seeds from 30 and 40 fruits in 1991 and 1992, respectively, to determine how dispersal alters this initial relatedness of seeds. Of the 335 and 876 seeds labeled in these two years, we recovered 63% and 76% of the seeds postdispersal and found that 19% and 23% of the recovered seeds were dispersed >10 cm from the maternal parent in the first and second years, respectively. In both years, ant-mediated dispersal reduced the number of seeds near the maternal parent. However, the effect of seed dispersal on the number of seeds in aggregations varied among years. Anti-mediated dispersal increased the number of seeds in dispersed aggregations in the first year and decreased the number in the second year. The average seed dispersal distance also differed between years: 2.41 m (+/-0.33) vs. 0.53 m (+/-0.06) in years 1 and 2, respectively. Ant-mediated seed dispersal decreased the probability of a seed having a sibling as its nearest neighbor postdispersal by between one-third and one-half. In contrast, seedling emergence was related to neither dispersal nor seed aggregation size in our study. However, the fitness effects of dispersal may be important later in the life cycle of this long-lived species and as such were undetected. One scenario is that plants derived from seeds dispersed out of their sibling relatedness group may gain minority advantage both in terms of mating success (if the population is SI) and other frequency-dependent processes like disease resistance.

TI  - Classifying ecosystem disservices and valuating their effects-a case study of Beijing, China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
AB  - Ecosystem disservices (EDS) is an important form of social-ecological interactions and can strongly influence people's perception of nature. However, compare to ecosystem services (ES), current studies on EDS are still very limited especially from the perspective of classification and valuation. Here, we firstly proposed a function-based classification system to better explain the general effects of EDS. Then, we used Beijing, the capital of China, as a case study to value three common urban EDS (excessive decrease in water quantity, plant-related diseases and infrastructure damage) there. The results suggested that the total EDS value of Beijing was approximately 10.54 billion RMB/year in 2019, which equaled about 5.13% of the total value of five important ecosystem services (food and raw material production, climate regulation, environmental quality regulation, soil retention and ecotourism). The finding showed that although EDS caused considerable financial loss, the potential economic gains from ecosystem services could still greatly outweigh the loss and therefore supported the current urban greening expansion policy in Beijing. Our study attempted to promote the bridging of ecosystem services and disservices studies and call for more equal consideration of both ES and EDS to create more compressive and sustainable planning.

TI  - Effect of rater instruction and standard area diagram structure on the accuracy of estimates of severity in Calonectria leaf blight
T2  - TROPICAL PLANT PATHOLOGY
AB  - The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effect of rater instruction and two standard area diagrams (SAD), that varied on scale structure, on the accuracy and reliability of visual estimates of calonectria leaf blight (CLB) severity. The minimum and the maximum severities of the newly developed SAD were 0.8% and 90%, respectively, with eight intermediate severity values for the linear SAD (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80%) and amended-linear SAD (3, 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75%). For validation, one group (21 raters) used the amended-linear SAD and another group (22 raters) used the linear SAD. For each group, three sequential assessments were made: 1) without any aid; 2) following specific instructions; and 3) using the respective SAD. Two raters with the highest overall accuracy and two with significant gains in accuracy after training were chosen, from each SAD group, for further evaluating the accuracy of unaided estimates after SAD use. The linear and amended-linear SAD similarly improved the overall accuracy of the estimates (CCC from 0.93 to 0.96). The overestimation of severity was reduced at the lower end of the scale (< 25% severity) when using the amended-linear SAD. A trend of increasing reliability was observed as raters progressed through the rounds of assessments, but there was no statistical difference. The less accurate raters during unaided estimates from both SAD groups improved their accuracy after the instruction and maintained the same level of accuracy in the two rounds after SAD use. Instruction was critical for inherently less accurate raters. We recommend the amended-linear SAD for assessments of CLB severity, which minimizes the overestimation at the lower severity levels.

TI  - Blind location and separation of callers in a natural chorus using a microphone array
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA
AB  - Male frogs and toads call in dense choruses to attract females. Determining the vocal interactions and spatial distribution of the callers is important for understanding acoustic communication in such assemblies. It has so far proved difficult to simultaneously locate and recover the vocalizations of individual callers. Here a microphone-array technique is developed for blindly locating callers using arrival-time delays at the microphones, estimating their steering-vectors, and recovering the calls with a frequency-domain adaptive beamformer. The technique exploits the time-frequency sparseness of the signal space to recover sources even when there are more sources than sensors. The method is tested with data collected from a natural chorus of Gulf Coast toads (Bufo valliceps) and Northern cricket frogs (Acris crepitans). A spatial map of locations accurate to within a few centimeters is constructed, and the individual call waveforms are recovered for nine individual animals within a 9 x 9 m(2). These methods work well in low reverberation when there are no reflectors other than the ground. They will require modifications to incorporate multi-path propagation, particularly for the estimation of time-delays. (C) 2009 Acoustical Society of America. [DOI: 10.1121/1.3158924]

TI  - Is the population of <i>Crotalus durissus</i> (Serpentes, Viperidae) expanding in Brazil?
T2  - JOURNAL OF VENOMOUS ANIMALS AND TOXINS INCLUDING TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Crotalus durissus are found from Mexico to northern Argentina in a highly disjunct distribution. According to some studies, this species is prone to occupy areas disturbed by human activities and floods comprise a plausible method of dispersal as inferred for some North American rattlesnakes. Based on the literature, it seems plausible that Crotalus durissus expanded their natural distribution in Brazil due to floods, but only in a few municipalities in Rio de Janeiro State. Data entries of Butantan Institute, in Sao Paulo, Brazil, from 1998 to 2012 show a declining tendency of snakes brought by donors. In addition, research shows no evidence of Crotalus durissus being an expanding species in the Brazilian territory.

TI  - Arabidopsis transcription factor WRKY8 functions antagonistically with its interacting partner VQ9 to modulate salinity stress tolerance
T2  - PLANT JOURNAL
AB  - The WRKY transcription factors have been demonstrated to play crucial roles in regulating stress responses; however, the exact mechanisms underlying their involvement in stress responses are not fully understood. Arabidopsis WRKY8 was predominantly expressed in roots and was highly upregulated by salt treatment. Disruption of WRKY8 rendered plants hypersensitive to salt, showing delayed germination, inhibited post-germination development and accelerated chlorosis. Further investigation revealed that WRKY8 interacted with VQ9, and their interaction decreased the DNA-binding activity of WRKY8. The VQ9 protein was exclusively localized in the nucleus, and VQ9 expression was strongly responsive to NaCl treatment. Mutation of VQ9 enhanced tolerance to salt stress, indicating that VQ9 acts antagonistically with WRKY8 to mediate responses to salt stress. The antagonist functions of WRKY8 and VQ9 were consistent with an increased or reduced Na+/K+ concentration ratio, as well as contrasting expression patterns of downstream stress-responsive genes in salt-stressed wrky8 and vq9 mutants. Moreover, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays showed that WRKY8 directly bound the promoter of RD29A under salt conditions. These results provided strong evidence that the VQ9 protein acts as a repressor of the WRKY8 factor to maintain an appropriate balance of WRKY8-mediated signaling pathways to establish salinity stress tolerance.

TI  - Acclimation and adaptive responses of woody plants to environmental stresses
T2  - BOTANICAL REVIEW
AB  - The predominant emphasis on harmful effects of environmental stresses on growth of woody plants has obscured some very beneficial effects of such stresses. Slowly increasing stresses may induce physiological adjustment that protects plants from the growth inhibition and/or injury that follow when environmental stresses are abruptly imposed. In addition, short exposures of woody plants to extreme environmental conditions at critical times in their development often improve growth. Furthermore, maintaining harvested seedlings and plant products at very low temperatures extends their longevity.
   Drought tolerance: Seedlings previously exposed to water stress often undergo less inhibition of growth and other processes following transplanting than do seedlings not previously exposed to such stress. Controlled wetting and drying cycles often promote early budset, dormancy, and drought tolerance. In many species increased drought tolerance following such cycles is associated with osmotic adjustment that involves accumulation of osmotically active substances, Maintenance of leaf turgor often is linked to osmotic adjustment. A reduction in osmotic volume at full turgor also results in reduced osmotic potential, even in the absence of solute accumulation. Changes in tissue elasticity may be important for turgor maintenance and drought tolerance of plants that do not adjust osmotically.
   Water deficits and nutrient deficiencies promote greater relative allocation of photosynthate to root growth, ultimately resulting in plants that have higher root:shoot ratios and greater capacity to absorb water and minerals relative to the shoots that must be supported.
   At the molecular level, plants respond to water stress by synthesis of certain new proteins and increased levels of synthesis of some proteins produced under well-watered conditions. Evidence has been obtained for enhanced synthesis under water stress of water-channel proteins and other proteins that may protect membranes and other important macromolecules from damage and denaturation as cells dehydrate.
   Flood tolerance: Both artificial and natural flooding sometimes benefit woody plants. Flooding of orchard soils has been an essential management practice for centuries to increase fruit yields and improve fruit quality. Also, annual advances and recessions of floods are crucial for maintaining valuable riparian forests. Intermittent flooding protects bottomland forests by increasing groundwater supplies, transporting sediments necessary for creating favorable seedbeds, and regulating decomposition of organic matter. Major adaptations for flood tolerance of some woody plants include high capacity for producing adventitious roots that compensate physiologically for decay of original roots under soil anaerobiosis, facilitation of oxygen up-take through stomata and newly formed lenticels, and metabolic adjustments. Halophytes can adapt to saline water by salt tolerance, salt avoidance, or both.
   Cold hardiness: Environmental stresses that inhibit plant growth, including low temperature, drought, short days, and combinations of these, induce cold hardening and hardiness in many species. Cold hardiness develops in two stages: at temperatures between 10degrees and 20degreesC in the autumn, when carbohydrates and lipids accumulate; and at subsequent freezing temperatures. The sum of many biochemical processes determines the degree of cold tolerance. Some of these processes are hormone dependent and induced by short days; others that are linked to activity of enzyme systems are temperature dependent. Short days are important for development of cold hardiness in species that set buds or respond strongly to photoperiod. Nursery managers often expose tree seedlings to moderate water stress at or near the end of die growing season. This accelerates budset, induces early dormancy, and increases cold hardiness.
   Pollution tolerance: Absorption of gaseous air pollutants varies with resistance to flow along the pollutant's diffusion path. Hence, the amount of pollutant absorbed by leaves depends on stomatal aperture, stomatal size, and stomatal frequency. Pollution tolerance is increased when drought, dry air, or flooding of soil close stomatal pores.
   Heat tolerance: Exposure to sublethal high temperature can increase the thermotolerance of plants. Potential mechanisms of response include synthesis of heat-shock proteins and isoprene and antioxidant production to protect the photosynthetic apparatus and cellular metabolism.
   Breaking of dormancy: Seed dormancy can be broken by cold or heat. Embryo dormancy is broken by prolonged exposure of most seeds to temperatures of 1degrees to 15degreesC. The efficiency of treatment depends on interactions between temperature and seed moisture content. Germination can be postponed by partially dehydrating seeds or altering the temperature during seed stratification. Seed-coat dormancy can be broken by fires that rupture seed coats or melt seed-coat waxes, hence promoting water uptake. Seeds with both embryo dormancy and seed-coat dormancy may require exposure to both high and low temperatures to break dormancy. Exposure to smoke itself can also serve as a germination cue in breaking seed dormancy in some species.
   Bud dormancy of temperate-zone trees is broken by winter cold. The specific chilling requirement varies widely with species and genotype, type of bud (e.g., vegetative or floral bud), depth of dormancy, temperature, duration of chilling, stage of plant development, and daylength, Interruption of a cold regime by high temperature may negate the effect of sustained chilling or breaking of bud dormancy. Near-lethal heat stress may release buds from both endodormancy and ecodormancy.
   Pollen shedding: Dehiscence of anthers and release of pollen result from dehydration of walls of anther sacs. Both seasonal and diurnal pollen shedding are commonly associated with shrinkage and rupture of anther walls by low relative humidity. Pollen shedding typically is maximal near midday (low relative humidity) and low at night (high relative humidity). Pollen shedding is low or negligible during rainy periods.
   Seed dispersal: Gymnosperm cones typically dehydrate before opening. The cones open and shed seeds because of differential shrinkage between the adaxial and abaxial tissues of cone scales. Once opened, cones may close and reopen with changes in relative humidity. Both dehydration and heat are necessary for seed dispersal from serotinous (late-to-open) cones. Seeds are stored in serotinous cones because resinous bonds of scales prevent cone opening. After fire melts the resinous material, the cone scales can open on drying. Fires also stimulate germination of seeds of some species. Some heath plants require fire to open their serotinous follicles and shed seeds. Fire destroys the resin at the valves of follicles, and the valves then reflex to release the seeds. Following fire the follicles of some species require alternate wetting and drying for efficient seed dispersal.
   Stimulation of reproductive growth., Vegetative and reproductive growth of woody plants are negatively correlated. A heavy crop of fruits, cones, and seeds is associated with reduced vegetative growth in the same or following year (or even years). Subjecting trees to drought during early stages of fruit development to inhibit vegetative growth, followed by normal irrigation, sometimes favors reproductive growth. Short periods of drought at critical times not only induce formation of flower buds but also break dormancy of flower buds in some species. Water deficits may induce flowering directly or by inhibiting shoot flushing, thereby limiting the capacity of young leaves to inhibit floral induction. Postharvest water stress often results in abundant return bloom over that in well-irrigated plants. Fruit yields of some species are not reduced or are increased by withholding irrigation during the period of shoot elongation. In several species, osmotic adjustment occurs during deficit irrigation. In other species, increased fruit growth by imposed drought is not associated largely with osmotic adjustment and maintenance of leaf turgor.
   Seedling storage: Tree seedlings typically are stored at temperatures just above or below freezing. Growth and survival of cold-stored seedlings depend on such factors as: date of lifting from the nursery; species and genotype; storage temperature, humidity, and illumination; duration of storage; and handling of planting stock after storage. Seedlings to be stored over winter should be lifted from the nursery as late as possible. Dehydration of seedlings before, during, and after storage adversely affects growth of outplanted seedlings. Long-term storage of seedlings may result in depletion of stored carbohydrates by respiration and decrease of root growth potential. Although many seedlings are stored in darkness, a daily photoperiod during cold storage may stimulate subsequent growth and increase survival of outplanted seedlings. For some species, rapid thawing may decrease respiratory consumption of carbohydrates (over slowly thawed seedlings) and decrease development of molds.
   Pollen storage: Preservation of pollen is necessary for insurance against poor flowering years, for gene conservation, and for physiological and biochemical studies. Storage temperature and pollen moisture content largely determine longevity of stored pollen. Pollen can be stored successfully for many years in deep freezers at temperatures near -15degreesC or in liquid nitrogen (-196degreesC). Cryopreservation of pollen with a high moisture content is difficult because ice crystals may destroy the cells. Pollens of many species do not survive at temperatures below -40degreesC if their moisture contents exceed 20-30%. Pollen generally is air dried, vacuum dried, or freeze dried before it is stored. To preserve the germination capacity of stored pollen, rehydration at high humidity often is necessary.
   Seedstorage: Seeds are routinely stored to provide a seed supply during years of poor seed production, to maintain genetic diversity, and to breed plants. For a long time, seeds were classified as either orthodox (relatively long-lived, with capacity for dehydration to very low moisture contents without losing viability) or recalcitrant (short-lived and requiring a high moisture content for retention of viability). More recently, some seeds have been reclassified as suborthodox or intermediate because they retain viability when carefully dried. True orthodox seeds are preserved much more easily than are nonorthodox seeds. Orthodox seeds can be stored for a long time at temperatures between 2degrees and -20degreesC, with temperatures below -5degreesC preferable. Some orthodox seeds have been stored at superlow temperatures, although temperatures of -40degrees, -70degrees, or -196degreesC have not been appreciably better than -20degreesC for storage of seeds of a number of species. Only relatively short-term storage protocols have been developed for nonorthodox seeds. These treatments typically extend seed viability to as much as a year. The methods often require cryopreservation of excised embryos. Responses to cryopreservation of nonorthodox seeds or embryos vary with species and genotype, rate of drying, use of cryoprotectants, rates of freezing and thawing, and rate of rehydration.
   Fruit storage: Storing fruits at low temperatures above freezing, increasing the CO2 concentration, and lowering the O-2 concentration of fruit storage delays senescence of fruits and prolongs their life. Fruits continue to senesce and decay while in storage and become increasingly susceptible to diseases. Both temperate-zone and tropical fruits may develop chilling injury characterized by lesions, internal discoloration, greater susceptibility to decay, and shortened storage life. Chilling injury can be controlled by chemicals, temperature conditioning, and intermittent warming during storage. Stored fruits may become increasingly susceptible to disease organisms. Fruit diseases can be controlled by cold, which inhibits growth of microorganisms and maintains host resistance. Exposure of fruits to high CO2 and low O-2 during storage directly suppresses disease-causing fungi. Pathogens also can be controlled by exposing fruits to heat before, during, and after storage. Scald that often develops during low-temperature storage can be controlled by chemicals and by heat treatments.

TI  - Ethnomedicinal plants used for snakebite treatments in Ethiopia: a comprehensive overview
T2  - JOURNAL OF VENOMOUS ANIMALS AND TOXINS INCLUDING TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Traditional medicine plays an important role in the daily lives of people living in rural parts of Ethiopia. Despite the fact that Ethiopia has a long history of using traditional medicinal plants as an alternative medicine source, there is no checklist compiling these plants used for snakebite treatment. This review collected and compiled available knowledge on and practical usage of such plants in the country. A literature review on medicinal plants used to treat snakebites was conducted from 67 journal articles, PhD dissertation and MSc theses available online. Data that summarize scientific and folk names, administration methods, plant portion used for treatment and method of preparation of recipes were organized and analyzed based on citation frequency. The summarized results revealed the presence of 184 plant species distributed among 67 families that were cited for treating snakebite in Ethiopia. In this literature search, no single study was entirely dedicated to the study of traditional medicinal plants used for the treatment of snakebite in Ethiopia. Most of the species listed as a snakebite remedy were shrubs and climbers (44%) followed by herbs (33%) and trees (23%). Fabaceae was the most predominant family with the greatest number of species, followed by Solanaceae and Vitaceae. Remedies are mainly prepared from roots and leaves, through decoctions, infusions, powders and juices. Most remedies were administered orally (69%). The six most frequently mentioned therapeutically important plants were Nicotiana tabacum, Solanum incanum, Carissa spinanrum, Calpurnia aurea, Croton macrostachyus and Cynodon dactylon. Authors reviewed the vegetal substances involved in snakebite management and their action mode. In addition to screening the biologically active ingredients and pharmacological activities of these plant materials, future studies are needed to emphasize the conservation and cultivation of important medicinal plants of the country.

TI  - Bioactivity Evaluation of <i>Melaleuca cajuputi</i> (Myrtales: Myrtaceae) Crude Extracts against <i>Aedes</i> Mosquito
T2  - PERTANIKA JOURNAL OF TROPICAL AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE
AB  - Melaleuca cajuputi crude extract in four different solvents viz dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, hexane, and methanol were evaluated for their insecticidal properties against Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquito. Bioassay against larva and adult mosquito was done following World Health Organization's guidelines. Late 3rd and/or early 4th instar of Aedes larvae were assayed for different concentrations ranging from 10 to 120 mg/L of M. cajuputi crude extract. Larvicidal effects were observed in dichloromethane, hexane, and methanol. Dichloromethane gave the highest of mean mortality, against Re. aegypti (12.6 +/- 0.98) and Ae. albopictus (10.2 +/- 0.37) with LC50 of 104.8 mg/L and 106 mg/L, respectively. The adulticidal bioassay was tested against 3 - 5 days old of female mosquitoes with the range concentrations from 0.04 to 6.21 mg/cm(2). Amongst solvents used, extracts of dichloromethane and hexane showed effects against the adult mosquito. Extract in hexane gave 100% mortality against both Aedes with LC50 of 0.015 mg/cm(2) (Re. aegypti) and 0.022 mg/cm(2) ( Re. albopictus). In conclusion, the extract of M. cajuputi could be exploited in the development of potential plant-based products in controlling dengue Aedes vectors, particularly in the adult mosquito.

TI  - Cooperative harassment strategy by the European Starling to usurp cavities and reproductive cost for the neotropical Green-barred Woodpecker
T2  - NEOTROPICAL BIODIVERSITY
AB  - The European Starling (Sturnus vulgaris) is a cavity-nesting bird with great invasive potential. As a result of human intervention, this bird is now distributed across all continents (except Antarctica) and its distribution range is increasing at an alarming rate. The European Starling was introduced to Argentina in 1983 and is currently distributed across almost the entire country. It is considered one of the hundred most damaging invasive species in the world and constitutes a serious competitive threat to native cavity-nesting birds. Interactions between European Starlings and cavity-nesting birds generally have negative consequences on native bird populations, although there are still few reports in the literature that account for the degree of damage. In this study, we report for the first time details of the harassment strategy and subsequent cavity usurpation by European Starlings on a breeding pair of Green-barred Woodpeckers (Colaptes melanochloros) in an urban area of central-eastern Argentina. Over one breeding season, the woodpeckers excavated seven cavities, none of which were successful. In six of these reproductive attempts (86%) we recorded interactions with European Starlings and in five (71%) the cavity was usurped. On three occasions we recorded a cooperative harassment strategy by a group of European Starlings causing the woodpeckers to abandon the cavity. Our report is especially relevant if we consider the invasive potential of the European Starling worldwide and the frequently limited cavity supply in bird breeding habitats. Therefore, we encourage governmental authorities and environmental NGOs to take measures to control the populations of this aggressive invasive species.

TI  - Effects of zoochory on the spatial genetic structure of plant populations
T2  - MOLECULAR ECOLOGY
AB  - Spatial genetic structure (SGS) of plants results from the nonrandom distribution of related individuals. SGS provides information on gene flow and spatial patterns of genetic diversity within populations. Seed dispersal creates the spatial template for plant distribution. Thus, in zoochorous plants, dispersal mode and disperser behaviour might have a strong impact on SGS. However, many studies only report the taxonomic group of seed dispersers, without further details. The recent increase in studies on SGS provides the opportunity to review findings and test for the influence of dispersal mode, taxonomic affiliation of dispersers and their behaviour. We compared the proportions of studies with SGS among groups and tested for differences in strength of SGS using Sp statistics. The presence of SGS differed among taxonomic groups, with reduced presence in plants dispersed by birds. Strength of SGS was instead significantly influenced by the behaviour of seed dispersal vectors, with higher SGS in plant species dispersed by animals with behavioural traits that result in short seed dispersal distances. We observed high variance in the strength of SGS in plants dispersed by animals that actively or passively accumulate seeds. Additionally, we found SGS was also affected by pollination and marker type used. Our study highlights the importance of vector behaviour on SGS even in the presence of variance created by other factors. Thus, more detailed information on the behaviour of seed dispersers would contribute to better understand which factors shape the spatial scale of gene flow in animal-dispersed plant species.

TI  - Molecular Epidemiology of American Tegumentary Leishmaniasis in Panama
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - American tegumentary leishmaniasis is an increasing public health problem in Panama. This study describes the clinical characteristics and the molecular epidemiology of leishmaniasis in Panama over a 5-year period (2004-2008). Additionally, we applied a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP)-based assay to identify Leishmania species in clinical isolates, skill scrapings, and sandflies specimens. Whereas 60.3% of cases were detected with conventional parasitologic techniques (smear or in vitro culture), the PCR detected 72% positive patients. Our clinical-epidemiologic data corroborate the high incidence of L. (Viannia) panamensis and provide evidence of peridomestic and/or domestic transmission. Mucosal involvement was observed in 4.2% of the patients. The overall natural infection rate with Leishmania in 103 pools of sandflies was 0.46%. Lutzomyia gomezi and Lutzomya panamensis were the prevalent species incriminated as vectors at the capture sites in central Panama. This study contributes to a better knowledge of the current epidemiology of tegumentary leishmaniasis in Panama.

TI  - First record of larval microhabitats of sandflies in Mexico with the description of the fourth instar larva of <i>Brumptomyia hamata</i>
T2  - MEDICAL AND VETERINARY ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - Despite the medical importance of sandflies as vectors (Diptera: Phlebotominae) of Leishmania spp., immature stages of phlebotomine sandflies have never been found in the wild in Mexico. In the present investigation, we sought to identify specific microhabitats associated with the presence of sandfly immature stages. Field work was conducted in 11 localities of the Yucatan Peninsula and we collected soil samples from each site during two periods (November 2007 to April 2008, November 2008). Soil samples were transported to our base camp and were processed using the Berlese's funnels. We processed a total 242 soil samples with an average weight of 362 +/- (SD) 317 gr. From these samples, we were able to recover 51 phlebotomine larvae in five different microhabitats and largest number was obtained from mammal burrows (88%) and from tree-buttresses of Brosimium alicastrum (Berg) (6%). We identified larval microhabitat for Brumptomyia hamata (Fairchild & Hertig) and those specimens provided the material to describe for the first time the fourth instar larva. We also include information of a larval microhabitat of Lutzomyia cruciata (Coquillett). In addition, we recorded a total of 4872 arthropods from 15 taxa in all those soil samples in which sandfly larvae were found, being Collembola (76%) and Acari (10%) the most abundant.

TI  - <i>Galictis cuja</i> (Mammalia): An update of current knowledge and geographic distribution
T2  - IHERINGIA SERIE ZOOLOGIA
AB  - The lesser grison (Galictis cuja) is one of the least-known mustelids in the Neotropics, despite its broad range across South America. This study aimed to explore current knowledge of the distribution of the species to identify gaps in knowledge and anticipate its full geographic distribution. Eighty-nine articles have mentioned G. cuja since 1969, but only 13 focused on the species. We generated a detailed model of the species' potential distribution that validated previous maps, but with improved detail, supporting previous southernmost records, and providing a means of identifying priority sites for conservation and management of the species.

TI  - Decline of disjunct green salamander (<i>Aneides</i> <i>aeneus</i>) populations in the southern Appalachians
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Coincident with other amphibians around the world Aneides aeneus, a terrestrial plethodontid salamander, suffered a population collapse in a disjunct portion of its range in the mid-late 1970s. Long-term monitoring of seven historical green salamander populations throughout the 1990s showed a 98% decline in relative abundance since 1970. Three out of six populations first discovered in 1991 also crashed in 1996-1997. The synchronized suddenness of the declines, their region-wide impact, and effects on both small and larger populations, suggest the role of a novel agent of mortality beginning in the mid-late 1970s. Acting alone, but more likely in concert, habitat loss, overcollecting, epidemic disease and climate change could account for this region-wide decline. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI  - Short Report: Hemophagocytic Syndrome as Uncommon Presentation of Disseminated Toxoplasmosis in an Immunocompetent Adult from Chinese Kunming
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Hemophagocytic syndrome is a rare disease that is often fatal, despite treatment. An immunocompetent patient was presented with fever, hepatosplenomegaly, cytopenias, hypertriglyceridemia, hypofibrinogenemia, and hyperferritinemia, which conformed to a hemophagocytic syndrome diagnosis. Despite broad antibiotic treatment, the patient's clinical condition rapidly deteriorated and he died within 8 days of admission. Blood cultures and a serology test were negative; however, based on morphological characteristics, tissue cysts Toxoplasma gondii were found in the bone marrow. Based on polymerase chain reaction analysis, identity of the parasite was confirmed. Although very rare, T. gondii-associated hemophagocytic syndrome should be suspected in the case of cytopenia or multiorgan failure symptoms. To our knowledge, this is the first fatal toxoplasmosis case reported from China.

TI  - DNA sequence incongruence and inconsistent morphology obscure species boundaries in the <i>Teratosphaeria suttonii</i> species complex
T2  - MYCOSCIENCE
AB  - Teratosphaeria suttonii (=Kirramyces epicoccoides) is a leaf pathogen that can cause premature defoliation, reduced growth and vigor, and subsequent tree death of many Eucalyptus species. Although the fungus primarily infects mature leaves in the lower canopy, infections can spread to younger leaves during continued epidemics or when trees are stressed. Teratosphaeria suttonii has a wide distribution in Australia and has been introduced to many other parts of the world, most probably with germplasm used to establish plantations. The aim of this study was to establish the phylogenetic relationships between T. suttonii isolates from different countries and to consider whether cryptic species exist in a species complex. DNA from parts of the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer, beta-tubulin, and elongation factor-1 alpha genes was sequenced and analyzed for isolates from throughout the range of T. suttonii in Australia, and from six countries (China, Indonesia, South Africa, Uruguay, United States, and Vietnam) where the pathogen is introduced. Morphometrics of conidia produced both in vivo and in vitro were also considered. Analysis of the sequence data resulted in incongruent genealogies. Furthermore, groups of isolates in the genealogies could not be linked to area of origin. Similarly, differences in conidial morphology could not be linked to any of the phylogenetic groups. There was no evidence of distinct species boundaries, and isolates from Australia were closely related to those from other parts of the world. The results of this study support the treatment of T. suttonii as a morphologically and genetically diverse species in its natural range in Australia. The diversity is reflected in introduced populations.

TI  - Expression characteristics and function of CAS and a new beta-amyrin synthase in triterpenoid synthesis in birch (<i>Betula platyphylla</i> Suk.)
T2  - PLANT SCIENCE
AB  - Triterpenoids produced by the secondary metabolism of Betula platyphylla Suk. exhibit important pharmacological activities, such as tumor inhibition, anti-HIV, and defense against pathogens, but the yield of natural synthesis is low, which is insufficient to meet people's needs. In this study, we identified two OSC genes of birch, named as BpCAS and Bp beta-AS, respectively. The expression of BpCAS and Bp beta-AS were higher levels in roots and in stems, respectively, and they induced expression in response to methyl jasmonate (MeJA), gibberellin (GA3), abscisic acid (ABA), ethylene and mechanical damage. The function of the two genes in the triterpene synthesis of birch was identified by reverse genetics. The inhibition of Bp beta-AS gene positively regulates synthesis of betulinic acid. BpCAS interference can significantly promote the upregulation of lupeol synthase gene (BPW) and beta-amyrin synthase gene(BPY), and conversion of 2,3-oxidosqualene to the downstream products betulinic acid and oleanolic acid. This study provided a basis for the genetic improvement of triterpenoid synthesis in birch through genetic engineering. The obtained transgenic birch and suspension cells served as material resources for birch triterpenoid applications in further.

TI  - The detection of cryptic <i>Plasmodium</i> infection among villagers in Attapeu province, Lao PDR
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   Although the malaria burden in the Lao PDR has gradually decreased, the elimination of malaria by 2030 presents many challenges. Microscopy and malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are used to diagnose malaria in the Lao PDR; however, some studies have reported the prevalence of sub-microscopic Plasmodium infections or asymptomatic Plasmodium carriers in endemic areas. Thus, highly sensitive detection methods are needed to understand the precise malaria situation in these areas.
   Methodology/Principal findings
   A cross-sectional malaria field survey was conducted in 3 highly endemic malaria districts (Xaysetha, Sanamxay, Phouvong) in Attapeu province, Lao PDR in 2015, to investigate the precise malaria endemicity in the area; 719 volunteers from these villages participated in the survey. Microscopy, RDTs and a real-time nested PCR were used to detect Plasmodium infections and their results were compared. A questionnaire survey of all participants was also conducted to estimate risk factors of Plasmodium infection. Numbers of infections detected by the three methods were microscopy: P. falciparum (n = 1), P. vivax (n = 2); RDTs: P. falciparum (n = 2), P. vivax (n = 3); PCR: Plasmodium (n = 47; P. falciparum [n = 4], P. vivax [n = 41], mixed infection [n = 2]; 6.5%, 47/719). Using PCR as a reference, the sensitivity and specificity of microscopy were 33.3% and 100.0%, respectively, for detecting P. falciparum infection, and 7.0% and 100.0%, for detecting P. vivax infection. Among the 47 participants with parasitemia, only one had a fever (>= 37.5 E C) and 31 (66.0%) were adult males. Risk factors of Plasmodium infection were males and soldiers, whereas a risk factor of asymptomatic Plasmodium infection was a history of >= 3 malaria episodes.
   Conclusions/Significance
   There were many asymptomatic Plasmodium carriers in the study areas of Attapeu province in 2015. Adult males, probably soldiers, were at high risk for malaria infection. P. vivax, the dominant species, accounted for 87.2% of the Plasmodium infections among the participants. To achieve malaria elimination in the Lao PDR, highly sensitive diagnostic tests, including PCR-based diagnostic methods should be used, and plans targeting high-risk populations and elimination of P. vivax should be designed and implemented.

TI  - Deep sequencing identified potential miRNAs involved in defence response, stress and plant growth characteristics of wild genotypes of cardamom
T2  - PLANT BIOLOGY
AB  - Cardamom has long been used as a food flavouring agent and in ayurvedic medicines for mouth ulcers, digestive problems and even depression. Extensive occurrence of pests and diseases adversely affect its cultivation and result in substantial reductions in total production and productivity. Numerous studies revealed the significant role of miRNAs in plant biotic stress responses. In the current study, miRNA profiling of cultivar and wild cardamom genotypes was performed using an Ion Proton sequencer. We identified 161 potential miRNAs representing 42 families, including monocot/tissue-specific and 14 novel miRNAs in both genotypes. Significant differences in miRNA family abundance between the libraries were observed in read frequencies. A total of 19 miRNAs (from known miRNAs) displayed a twofold difference in expression between wild and cultivar genotypes. We found 1168 unique potential targets for 40 known miRNA families in wild and 1025 potential targets for 42 known miRNA families in cultivar genotypes. The differential expression analysis revealed that most miRNAs identified were highly expressed in cultivars and, furthermore, lower expression of miR169 and higher expression of miR529 in wild cardamom proved evidence that wild genotypes have stronger drought stress tolerance and floral development than cultivars. Potential targets predicted for the newly identified miRNAs from the miRNA libraries of wild and cultivar cardamom genotypes involved in metabolic and developmental processes and in response to various stimuli. qRT-PCR confirmed miRNAs were differentially expressed between wild and cultivar genotypes. Furthermore, four target genes were validated experimentally to confirm miRNA-mRNA target pairing using RNA ligase-mediated 5 ' Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (5 ' RLM-RACE) PCR.

TI  - Annual <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> entomological inoculation rates (EIR) across Africa:: literature survey, internet access and review
T2  - TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - This paper presents the results of an extensive search of the formal and informal literature on annual Plasmodium falciparum entomological inoculation rates (EIR) across Africa from 1980 onwards. It first describes how the annual EIR data were collated, summarized, gee-referenced and staged for public access on the internet. Problems of data standardization, reporting accuracy and the subsequent publishing of information on the internet follow. The review was conducted primarily to investigate the spatial heterogeneity of malaria exposure in Africa and supports the idea of highly heterogeneous risk at the continental, regional and country levels. The implications for malaria control of the significant spatial (and seasonal) variation in exposure to infected mosquito bites are discussed.

TI  - Zootherapeutic uses of wildmeat and associated products in the semiarid region of Brazil: general aspects and challenges for conservation
T2  - JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY AND ETHNOMEDICINE
AB  - Background: Hunting wildlife for medicinal purposes is a widespread practice throughout Brazil; however, studies about the animals used for zootherapeutic practices have been performed almost exclusively with traders (herbalists) and end consumers, and not hunters. This makes it difficult to completely understand the market chain, trade strategies, and drivers of this practice. The present study investigated the species hunted or trapped for traditional medicinal uses by collecting data about the use and trade of the zootheurapeutic species.
   Methods: We collected data through semi-structured questionnaires complemented by free interviews and informal conversations with hunters in five municipalities of semiarid region of the NE Brazil. We calculated the Use-Value (UV) index to determine the relative importance of each species reported by interviewees. The Multiple Linear Regression model was used to assess the influence of socioeconomic factors (age, schooling, residence zone, trade of zootherapeutic species) on species richness exploited by hunters.
   Results: Hunters reported a significant richness of species (n = 39) intentionally or opportunistically captured for use as remedies for treatment of 92 diseases or conditions in humans or livestock. Respondents also reported trade strategies that were well-organized and quickly directed the selling of wild animals or byproducts via modern technology. We found a weak positive relationship only between species richness and hunters' age via MLR model.
   Conclusions: The hunting and use of wild species for medicinal purposes are culturally disseminated activities among hunters. Our results demonstrate the importance of studying hunters in order to understanding the dynamics of bushmeat exploitation and to develop more efficient strategies for wildlife use and conservation.

TI  - Prevalence of Varied Coat Coloration in a Yellow-Throated Marten (<i>Martes flavigula</i>) Population
T2  - ANIMALS
AB  - Abnormal coloration is very rare in any given population of wildlife; however, our research identified a yellow-throated marten population with a high ratio of this phenomenon for the first time. Across the main distribution of the species with relevant observational data, we observed abnormally-colored martens in only Northeast Tiger and Leopard National Park. Abnormal coloration had a variety of forms and individuals with white paws that accounted for a larger proportion of the overall population than normal individuals. This shows heritable variation in the region, which is worthy of further research.
   Mammalian coat color is determined by heritable variations such as disease, nutrition, and hormone levels. Variation in animal coat color is also considered an environmental indicator and provides clues for the study of population genetics and biogeography. Records of abnormal coloration in the wild are rare, not only because it is often selected against, but also because of the difficulties in detection of the phenomenon. We used long-term camera-trapping data to first report abnormal coat coloration in yellow-throated marten (Martes flavigula) in China. Six types of abnormal coloration were found only in the Northeast Tiger and Leopard National Park, Northeast China, which were not reported in other regions in China. A total of 268 videos of Martes flavigula contained normal coloration, 455 videos of individuals of the species contained abnormal coloration, 437 contained the 'gloving' type (martens with de-pigmented front toes, paws or lower forelimbs), while the remaining other 18 videos contained five types (different degrees of white-spotting and dilution). The higher relative abundance index (0.428, 'gloving' to 0.329, normal) and wide distribution area of the 'gloving' type indicated that this abnormal coat coloration type is usual in Northeast China, which may reflect genetic variability in the local population. These records will contribute to further research on animal coat color and its corresponding adaptive strategy.

TI  - Surveillance of phlebotomine fauna and <i>Didelphis marsupialis</i> (Didelphimorphia: Didelphidae) infection in an area highly endemic for visceral leishmaniasis in Colombia
T2  - BIOMEDICA
AB  - Introduction: The study of the interaction between the parasite, the vector and the mammalian hosts, including man, allows to understand the behavior of the leishmaniases.
   Objetive: To determine the presence of Lutzomyia species and to detect the Leishmania infection in D. marsupialis in an endemic area for visceral leishmaniasis.
   Materials and methods: Phlebotomine fauna and individuals of D. marsupialis were collected with CDC and Tomahawk (R) traps, respectively. The species of Lutzomyia were identified using the Young & Duncan (1994) key. Ear and tail biopsies and blood samples from D. marsupialis were taken to identify the Leishmania species by amplifying a fragment of the gene associated with the 70 kD heat shock protein.
   Results: Seven Lutzomyia species were identified: Lu. evansi, Lu. gomezi, Lu. panamensis, Lu. dubitans, Lu. cayennensis cayennensis, Lu. rangeliana and Lu. trinidadensis. The first three species have epidemiological importance in Colombia because of their implications in the transmission of the Leishmania parasite. Sixty-five tissue samples from 19 D. marsupialis individuals were negative for Leishmania spp.
   Conclusions: The presence of the Lutzomyia species that have been identified as vectors for Leishmania inside and around houses in the village of EI Bledo, in EI Carmen de Bolivar represents a risk of infection. Furthermore, the presence of Lu. panamensis is reported for first time in EI Carmen de Bolivar in Colombia. Although the lack of detection of Leishmania spp in D. marsupialis samples may suggest that D. marsupialis does not play an important role in the transmission cycle of Leishmania in this region, it is necessary to carry out further longitudinal studies to confirm this hypothesis.

TI  - Global phylogeny of the Shiitake mushroom and related <i>Lentinula</i> species uncovers novel diversity and suggests an origin in the Neotropics
T2  - MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION
AB  - Lentinula (Basidiomycota, Agaricales) includes the most widely cultivated mushroom in the world, Lentinula edodes, also known as shiitake (Japanese) or xiang-gu (Chinese). At present, nine species are recognized in the genus, based on morphology, mating criteria, and geographic distribution. However, analyses of internal transcribed spacers (ITS) of ribosomal RNA genes have suggested that there are cryptic lineages. We analyzed a global-scale phylogenetic dataset from 325 Lentinula individuals from 24 countries in Asia-Australasia and the Americas plus Madagascar, with 325 sequences of ITS, 80 LSU sequences, and 111 sequences of translation elongation factor (tef1-alpha) genes. We recovered 15 independent lineages (Groups 1-15) that may correspond to species. Lineages in Asia-Australasia (Groups 1-5) and the Americas plus Madagascar (Groups 6-15) formed sister clades. Four lineages are represented only by sequences from single individuals and require further molecular sampling, including L. aff. raphanica (Group 7), L. ixodes (Group 8), L. boryana (Group 12), and L. aff. aciculospora (Group 14). Groups 1 and 5 are here referred to L. edodes and L. aff. edodes, respectively. However, these groups most likely represent the same species and are only recognized as (unsupported) monophyletic lineages by maximum likelihood analyses of ITS alone. Other putative species resolved here include L. lateritia (Group 2), L. novae-zelandieae (Group 3), L. aff. lateritia (Group 4), L. raphanica (Group 6), L. aff. detonsa (Group 9), L. detonsa (Group 10), L. guzmanii sp. nov. (Group 11), L. aciculospora (Group 13), andL. madagasikarensis (Group 15). Groups 9-12 represent the "L. boryana complex ". Molecular clock and historical biogeographic analyses suggest that the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of Lentinula can be placed in the middle Oligocene, ca. 30 million years ago (Ma), and had a likely presence in neotropical America. The MRCA of Lentinula in the Americas and Madagascar lived ca. 22 Ma in the Neotropics and the MRCA of Lentinula in Asia-Australasia lived ca. 6 Ma in Oceania. Given the current knowledge about plate tectonics and paleoclimatic models of the last 30 Myr, our phylogenetic hypothesis suggests that the extant distribution of Lentinula is likely to have arisen, in large part, due to long-distance dispersal. Lentinula collections include at least four dubious taxa that need further taxonomic studies: L. reticeps from the USA (Ohio); L. guarapiensis from Paraguay; Lentinus puiggarii from Brazil (Sa & SIM;o Paulo); and "L. platinedodes " from Vietnam. Approximately ten of the fifteen Groups are reported on Fagaceae, which appears to be the ancestral substrate of Lentinula.

TI  - Canopy characteristics and light distribution in <i>Sapindus mukorossi</i> Gaertn. are influenced by crown architecture manipulation in the hilly terrain of Southeast China
T2  - SCIENTIA HORTICULTURAE
AB  - Sapindus mukorossi Gaertn. (soapberry) is currently one of the most widely used biodiesel feedstocks in China. The canopy architecture of plants has significant impacts on microclimate, transpiration, and carbon acquisition and allocation, which can lead to plant disease and low yield. To solve low yield problems in soapberry and evaluate the relationship between light distribution and the canopy, crown architecture manipulation was carried out in this study to provide an ideotype to decrease leaf and fruit abscission. Canopy characteristics (LAI and CGfr), light characteristics (light ratio and PPFD) and photosynthetic characteristics (Pn, Tr, Gs and Ci) in different soapberry tree architectures were measured for 2 years to analyze light distribution, light interception and photosynthetic ability. This study also evaluated a two-factor interaction between scaffold branch angle (A30 degrees, A45 degrees, A60 degrees, and A90 degrees) and scaffold branch number (N3, N4, N5, and SC). Controlling the scaffold branch angle influenced light distribution, and branch angles of 60 degrees and 90 degrees increased light absorbance by 2-3 times in the vertical layers and decreased the disparity between inner and outer light ratios in the horizontal layers. Light interception ability was positively correlated (R-2 = 0.785) with LAI from May to October, and the A90 degrees N3 canopy architecture, which had 16% higher light interception ability than the other treatments and maintained the highest cumulative LAI (19.57) during the growing season, was the most suitable for preserving leaves in August and October. Light interception ability had no correlation with LAI in April (the month before blooming) but was positively correlated (R-2 = 0.485) with the number of inflorescences, which indicated that higher light interception in April increased the number of inflorescences. Controlling the scaffold branch number significantly influenced Pn, Tr and Gs, and in particular, architectures with 3 scaffold branches provided 1-2 times higher photosynthetic ability than did the other architectures, with A60 degrees N3 increasing Pn to 30 mu mol CO(2)m.(-2)s(-1) and Gs to 0.26 mol H2O center dot m(-2).s(-1). The number of inflorescences was not directly correlated with yield, but yield in November was positively correlated (R-2 = 0.5) with the photosynthetic rate*LAI in August. The highest yield, 0.3 kg.m(-2) (projection area of crown), occurred in A60 degrees N3 and A90 degrees N3; the former was positively correlated with the photosynthetic rate in August, and the latter was influenced by high LAI and high light interception. Overall, high light interception ability could solve the problem of leaf abscission, and high photosynthetic ability could decrease fruit abscission in soapberry trees. A60 degrees N3 and A90 degrees N3 are the current ideotypes. These findings reveal the major factors influenced by canopy architecture and lay a foundation for further study of photosynthetic product distribution in different light environments. The selection of ideal architectural types will provide a mode and direction for further creative research into 3-dimensional visual structures, which will lead to additional theoretical and technical support for tree architecture planning.

TI  - Presence and potential distribution of malaria-infected New World primates of Costa Rica
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
AB  - Background In South and Central America, Plasmodium malariae/Plasmodium brasilianum, Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium simium, and Plasmodium falciparum has been reported in New World primates (NWP). Specifically in Costa Rica, the presence of monkeys positive to P. malariae/P brasilianum has been identified in both captivity and in the wild. The aim of the present study was to determine the presence of P. brasilianum, P. falciparum, and P. vivax, and the potential distribution of these parasites-infecting NWP from Costa Rica. Methods The locations with PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) positive results and bioclimatic predictors were used to construct ecological niche models based on a modelling environment that uses the Maxent algorithm, named kuenm, capable to manage diverse settings to better estimate the potential distributions and uncertainty indices of the potential distribution. Results PCR analysis for the Plasmodium presence was conducted in 384 samples of four primates (Howler monkey [n = 130], White-face monkey [n = 132], Squirrel monkey [n = 50], and red spider monkey [n = 72]), from across Costa Rica. Three Plasmodium species were detected in all primate species (P. falciparum, P. malariae/P. brasilianum, and P. vivax). Overall, the infection prevalence was 8.9%, but each Plasmodium species ranged 2.1-3.4%. The niche model approach showed that the Pacific and the Atlantic coastal regions of Costa Rica presented suitable climatic conditions for parasite infections. However, the central pacific coast has a more trustable prediction for malaria in primates. Conclusions The results indicate that the regions with higher suitability for Plasmodium transmission in NWP coincide with regions where most human cases have been reported. These regions were also previously identified as areas with high suitability for vector species, suggesting that enzootic and epizootic cycles occur.

TI  - The metabolic alteration and apparent preservation of the zombie ant brain
T2  - JOURNAL OF INSECT PHYSIOLOGY
AB  - Some parasites can manipulate the behavior of their animal hosts to increase transmission. An interesting area of research is understanding how host neurobiology is manipulated by microbes to the point of displaying such aberrant behaviors. Here, we characterize the metabolic profile of the brain of an insect at the moment of the behavioral manipulation by a parasitic microbe. Our model system are ants infected with the parasitic fungus Ophiocordyceps kimflemingiae (=unilateralis), which manipulates ants to climb and bite into plant substrates, before killing the host (i.e. zombie ants). At the moment of the behavioral manipulation by the fungus, the host's brain is not invaded by the fungus which is known to extensively invade muscle tissue. We found that, despite not being invaded by the parasite, the brains of manipulated ants are notably different, showing alterations in neuromodulatory substances, signs of neurodegeneration, changes in energy use, and antioxidant compound that signal stress reactions by the host. Ergothionine, a fungal derived compound with known neuronal cytoprotection functions was found to be highly elevated in zombie ant brains suggesting the fungus, which does not invade the central nervous system, is preserving the brain.

TI  - High Abundance of Fluorescent Biological Aerosol Particles in Winter in Beijing, China
T2  - ACS EARTH AND SPACE CHEMISTRY
AB  - Primary biological aerosol particles (PBAP) such as pollen, fungal spores, bacteria, and viruses represent a major subset of particulate matter for both coarse and fine aerosols. Although PBAP affect climate and human health, there still remains a large uncertainty regarding their sources and characteristics, especially in urban atmospheres. Here we combined online fluorescent biological aerosol particle measurements and offline fluorescent and biomarker analysis in winter in Beijing, a city suffering from severe air pollution. Our results show that the abundance of fluorescent biological particles was higher than that of many other natural environments. Bioaerosol loadings were greatly enhanced during mealtime, indicating local emissions of bioaerosols from human activities. The contributions of fungal spores to total organic carbon (OC) from fluorescent bioaerosol analyses were estimated to be around 10% both in clean and polluted periods. This study highlights the importance of human activities to emit bioaerosols into the atmosphere and the potential uncertainties of modeling bioaerosol effects in climate systems.

TI  - Conspecific and heterospecific plant-soil feedbacks influence survivorship and growth of temperate tree seedlings
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
AB  - 1. The Janzen-Connell (J-C) Model proposes that host-specific enemies could maintain high tree species diversity by reducing seedling performance near conspecific adults. An implicit, but untested assumption of the J-C Model is that negative conspecific feedbacks would promote replacement by heterospecific seedlings.
   2. In a glasshouse experiment, we tested plant-soil feedbacks as a J-C mechanism in four temperate tree species. We assessed effects of conspecific- relative to heterospecific-cultured soil extracts on seedling survival, total mass and performance for each focal species. To test the implicit assumption of replacement by heterospecific seedlings, we also compared relative performance of conspecific versus heterospecific seedlings grown with soil extract cultured by a particular tree species. We also tested whether soil microbes caused these plant-soil feedbacks and whether low irradiance increased seedling vulnerability to pathogens.
   3. When grown with conspecific versus heterospecific soil extract, Acer rubrum mass decreased, Quercus rubra mass increased and Fraxinus americana increased survival. Conspecific extract reduced Acer saccharum mass in low light but increased it in high light. To integrate survival and growth, we examined seedling performance [(mean total mass x mean survival time)/(days of experiment)] at low and high light. In conspecific versus heterospecific soil extract, seedling performance was lower in two, higher in four and neutral in 18 of 24 cases, suggesting no advantage to dispersing away from conspecifics. Based on relative seedling performance within a soil extract, conspecific seedlings were disadvantaged in two, favoured in three and neutral in 19 of 24 cases relative to heterospecific seedlings.
   4. Species pairwise interactions of soil modification and seedling performance were chemically mediated, occurring regardless of sterilization. Microbes lacked host specificity and reduced performance regardless of extract source. Additionally, microbial factors reduced seedling performance for Q. rubra regardless of light availability, and for A. rubrum and F. americana only in high light.
   5. Synthesis. These chemical-mediated plant-soil feedbacks probably influence community dynamics, but are inconsistent with the J-C Model. Even when a species' seedlings responded more negatively to conspecific than heterospecific soil, heterospecific seedlings were not necessarily favoured in that species' soil, precluding heterospecific replacement as an explanation for coexistence.

TI  - Flavonoid accumulation modulates the responses of cassava tuberous roots to postharvest physiological deterioration
T2  - POSTHARVEST BIOLOGY AND TECHNOLOGY
AB  - Postharvest physiological deterioration (PPD) caused by wounding is one of the main constraints that affect the development of cassava industry. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the PPD are unknown. In the present study the adaptive response to wound stress was analyzed in combination with transcriptome and metabolome in four kinds of PPD phenomenon from cassava tuberous roots. The results indicated that starch, beta-carotene, (-)-epigallocatechin, cyanidin-3-O-glucoside, and L-epicatechin were altered in the wounded tuberous roots. Moreover, the ROS scavenging system was activated at the PPD preliminary stage. Transcriptome analysis further showed that the strongly induced genes were mainly related to carbohydrate metabolism, signal transduction, and polyketide metabolism. Twenty-eight differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the flavonoid pathway were preferably enriched. The relative quantitative analysis of seventeen genes demonstrated that they were responsive to PPD. Fifty-one differential flavonoid metabolites were detected in widely targeted metabolome profile, among which, luteolin, kaempferol, (-) epicatechin, phloretin, and naringenin were enhanced during PPD. The virus-induced gene silencing of MeCHS3 and MeANR showed that tuberous roots changed tolerance to PPD, and the total flavonoid and anthocyanin contents in leaves were changed. Therefore, the candidate genes and metabolites in flavonoid pathways could participate in PPD regulation. In addition, a proposed model was generated to elaborate the response mechanism of flavonoids under wounding stress, thus providing a future direction for breeding PPD-tolerant cultivars of cassava.

TI  - Determination of Mosquito (Diptera: Culicidae) Bloodmeal Sources in Western Australia: Implications for Arbovirus Transmission
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - A double-antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to determine the bloodmeal sources of adult mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) collected in encephalitis vector surveillance mosquito traps in Western Australia between May 1993 and August 2004. In total, 2,606 blood-fed mosquitoes, representing 29 mosquito species, were tested, and 81.7% reacted with one or more of the primary antibodies. Aedes camptorhynchus (Thomson) and Culex annulirostris Skuse were the most common species tested, making up 47.2% (1,234) and 35.6% (930), respectively. These species obtained bloodmeals from a variety of vertebrate hosts but particularly marsupials and cows. In contrast, Culex pullus Theobald (72.7%; 24/33), Culiseta atra (Lee) (70.0%; 7/10), Culex globocoxitus Dobrotworsky (54.5%; 12/22), and Culex quinquefasciatus Say (39.3%; 22/56) often obtained bloodmeals from birds. Although Ae. camptorhynchus and Cx. annulirostris are well established vectors of arboviruses, other mosquitoes also may have a role in enzootic and/or epizootic transmission.

TI  - THE EFFICACY AND PHYSICAL CONDITION OF OLYSET INSECTICIDE-TREATED NETS AFTER 5 YEARS USE IN RURAL LAO PDR
T2  - SOUTHEAST ASIAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - We assessed the insecticidal efficacy of Olyset nets after 5 years of use in rural villages of Lao PDR and evaluated the relationship between the physical condition of the nets and their insecticidal effect. Our results showed that most of the Olyset nets remained effective after 5 years of use; however, there was no significant relationship between the physical condition of the nets (ie, presence of holes, level of stains) and the insecticidal effect. The presence of large holes in polyester nets compared to the Olyset nets suggest the Olyset nets are stronger; however, nearly half of Olyset nets had small holes or had been previously repaired. Interestingly, the insecticide concentration and knockdown (KD) rate for 3 stored nets was low compared to the other nets routinely used in the house. To maintain the effectiveness of Olyset nets in rural villages of Lao PDR and other areas, residents should be advised to repair and store the nets appropriately and avoid exposure to high temperatures and direct sunlight for long periods.

TI  - The French Guianan endemic <i>Molossus</i> <i>barnesi</i> (Chiroptera: Molossidae) is a junior synonym for <i>M-coibensis</i>
T2  - MAMMALIAN BIOLOGY
AB  - The taxonomy of the small Neotropical Molossus species has been notoriously difficult due to a lack of adequate comparative material. One taxon in particular, Molossus barnesi Thomas, 1905 was believed to be restricted to a narrow stretch of coastal areas around Cayenne, in French Guiana and was so far represented only by three female specimens. It was variously considered as a species on its own, or synonymized with Molossus molossus or Molossus coibensis. Thanks to the discovery of several mixed colonies of these small molossids in two localities in French Guiana, we could obtain and measure a large sample (nearly 200 specimens) of adult individuals to better assess their morphological variation. Owing to largely bimodal and non-overlapping distributions of external measurements such as forearm length, we could demonstrate the existence of two sympatric morphotypes, the smaller one corresponding to M. barnesi and the larger one to M. molossus. Univariate and multivariate comparisons of cranio-dental and external characters further suggest that the new series of barnesi from French Guiana do not differ notably from specimens assigned to M. coibensis from elsewhere. Molecular reconstruction based on the barcode gene (CO1) confirmed their genetic distinctness, but also the overall close relationships (mean divergence of 1.7%) of all assayed taxa in this group. Although none of the haplotypes are shared across taxa, haplotypes of M. coibensis from Panama and M. barnesi from French Guiana are mixed in a single, poorly supported cluster, suggesting that these animals could represent a single biological species. Based on all evidences, we thus recommend treating barnesi as a junior synonym of M. coibensis, a species now widely and continuously distributed from Central America to Middle South America.

TI  - GASTROINTESTINAL PARASITES OF CAPTIVE AND FREE-LIVING LEMURS AND DOMESTIC CARNIVORES IN EASTERN MADAGASCAR
T2  - JOURNAL OF ZOO AND WILDLIFE MEDICINE
AB  - Fecal samples from captive and free-living lemurs at Ivoloina Zoological Park (IZP) and domestic carnivores from six villages surrounding IZP were evaluated between July and August 2012. Free-living lemurs from Betampona Natural Reserve (BNR), a relatively pristine rainforest fragment 40 km away, were also evaluated in November 2013. All 33 dogs sampled (100%) and 16 of 22 cats sampled (72.7%) were parasitized, predominantly with nematodes (strongyles, ascarids, and spirurids) as well as cestodes and protozoans. Similar types of parasites were identified in the lemur populations. Identification of spirurid nematodes and protozoans in the lemur fecal samples were of concern due to previously documented morbidity and mortality in lemurs from these parasitic agents. Twelve of 13 free-living (93%) and 31 of 49 captive (63%) lemurs sampled at IZP had a higher parasite prevalence than lemurs at BNR, with 13 of 24 (54%) being parasitized. The lemurs in BNR are likely at risk of increased exposure to these parasites and, therefore, increased morbidity and mortality, as humans and their domestic animals are encroaching on this natural area.

TI  - Comparison of two mammalian surveys made with camera traps in southeastern Brazil, focusing the abundance of wild mammals and domestic dogs
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY
AB  - Sampling allows assessing the impact of human activities on mammal communities. It is also possible to assess the accuracy of different sampling methods, especially when the sampling effort is similar. The present study aimed at comparing two mammalian surveys carried out over a three-year interval, in terms of sampling effort, capture success, abundance of domestic dogs, impact of human activities, and relative biomass using camera traps, in the Serra do Japi Biological Reserve and surroundings, located in Jundiai, state of Sao Paulo, southeastern Brazil. The total richness recorded was 13 species, one domestic and 12 wild mammals. Sampling effort in both surveys was similar, but capture success and number of captures differed. The abundance of wild mammals and dogs did also differ between surveys. There was a highly significant correlation between abundance of wild mammals and capture effort for the survey performed in 2006/2007, but not for the survey performed in 2009/2010. The difference between samples may be related to human disturbance, since the number of domestic mammals photographed was higher in the second survey, three years after the first survey. Despite being a reserve, the area is still under pressure from urbanization, biological invasion, environmental degradation, and hunting, which may reduce the abundance of wild mammals.

TI  - The endophytic continuum
T2  - MYCOLOGICAL RESEARCH
AB  - In spite of the term 'endophyte' being employed for all organisms that inhabit plants, mycologists have come to use the term 'fungal endophyte' for fungi that inhabit plants without causing visible disease symptoms. The term refers only to fungi at the moment of detection without regard for the future status of the interaction. This paper is a review of literature on non-balansiaceous fungi involved in asymptomatic colonisations of plants. These fungal endophytes represent a continuum of fungi with respect to physiological status, infection modus, colonisation pattern, secondary metabolism, life-history strategy, and developmental and evolutionary stages, but also with respect to the fungal and host taxa involved in the symbioses.
   We hypothesize that there are no neutral interactions, but rather that endophyte-host interactions involve a balance of antagonisms, irrespective of the plant organ infected. There is always at least a degree of virulence on the part of the fungi-is enabling infection, whereas defence of the plant host limits development of fungal invaders and disease. It is also hypothesized that the endophytes, in contrast to known pathogens, generally have far greater phenotypic plasticity and thus more options than pathogens: infection, local but also extensive colonisation, latency, virulence, pathogenity and (or) saprophytism. This phenotypic plasticity is a motor of evolution.

TI  - Morphological reassessments and DNA barcoding of <i>Pheidole rugaticeps</i> Emery and <i>Pheidole decarinata</i> Santschi collected in Nigeria
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TROPICAL INSECT SCIENCE
AB  - Studies have revealed that the genus Pheidole (Formicidae: Myrmicinae) is the most diverse group of ants and highly distributed around the globe. Species delimitation through DNA-based approaches has lately received increased attention to overcome the taxonomic hurdle. This study reassessed the morphology and barcode Pheidole rugaticeps Emery and Pheidole decarinata Santschi collected in Nigeria. P. rugaticeps and P. decarinata are the most abundant ant species in the area sampled. Taxonomy of both Pheidole spp were reassessed using morphometrics. The morphological diagnosis of the worker castes was consistent with P. rugaticeps Emery, 1877 specimen (CASENT0281618), and P. decarinata Santschi specimen (CASENT0913301) from AntWeb.org. For the DNA-based identification, LCO1490/HCO2198 and LepF1/LepR1 primer pairs that consistently amplified a 710-bp fragment of Cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (CO1) of invertebrates were used. The Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) program of the NCBI database was used to confirm the genus as Pheidole. However, the species identity produced less than 90% match with the available CO1 sequences in the database. DNA sequences of P. rugaticeps and P. decarinata were not previously submitted at NCBI or other online databases. Hence, DNA sequences of P. rugaticeps (accession no; MT309805) and P. decarinata (accession no; MT308581) were added to the NCBI database for the first time and will be additional diagnostic tools for future studies. The phylogenetic result suggested that both Pheidole species were distinct. The study encourages the combination of morphological and molecular practices to identify this diverse ant group.

TI  - Relationship between Immediate Post-Operative Appearance and 6-Week Operative Outcome in Trichiasis Surgery
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background: Surgical technique, including suture placement and tension, is believed to contribute to the outcome of bilamellar tarsal rotation surgery for trachomatous trichiasis. However, the immediate post-operative appearance that minimizes the chance of recurrence and other adverse outcomes has not been investigated.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: To explore whether the degree of correction immediately after surgery is predictive of surgical outcome at the 6-week post-operative visit, photographs taken immediately after surgery were used to predict surgical outcomes, including the severity of eyelid contour abnormality and trichiasis recurrence. Both eyelid contour abnormalities and recurrence were accurately predicted from the immediate post-operative photographs by an experienced oculoplastic surgeon 85% and 70% of the time, respectively. Participants with a "slight over-correction" that resulted in no eyelid contour abnormality and no recurrence were used to identify immediate post-operative contours that lead to a successful surgical outcome.
   Conclusions/Significance: The immediate post-operative eyelid contour is an important indicator of post-operative success of BLTR surgery. Based upon our findings, we developed a Surgery Photocard. This card illustrates some examples of immediate post-surgical appearances, which led to a successful outcome, as well as sub-optimal appearances, which led to poor surgical outcomes. The card also provides suggestions for improving the appearance by adjusting the suture placement or tension based upon standard oculoplastic principles.

TI  - In Vitro Testing of Crude Natural Plant Extracts from Costa Rica for Their Ability to Boost Innate Immune Cells against <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>
T2  - BIOMEDICINES
AB  - The increasing occurrence of antibiotic-resistant Staphylococcus (S.) aureus tremendously limits the antibiotic-based treatment options; therefore, an open discussion of alternative treatment strategies is urgently needed. The use of naturally derived materials might become a more promising concept, not only as directly acting antimicrobials, but also for stimulation of the immune system. Costa Rican plant extracts were screened for their ability to enhance the antimicrobial activity of human blood-derived cells against S. aureus infections. We identified three plant extracts which significantly reduced the growth of S. aureus in the presence of human blood without directly acting as antibacterials: Byrsonima crassifolia acetone bark extract, Mandevilla veraguasensis acetone vine extract and Verbesina oerstediana acetone bark extract (VEOEBA). The effect of VEOEBA was studied in more detail, and revealed that VEOEBA increases the antimicrobial activity of neutrophils by enhancing the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps.

TI  - The functional gene composition and metabolic potential of coral-associated microbial communities
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - The phylogenetic diversity of coral-associated microbes has been extensively examined, but some contention remains regarding whether coral-associated microbial communities are species-specific or site-specific. It is suggested that corals may associate with microbes in terms of function, although little is known about the differences in coral-associated microbial functional gene composition and metabolic potential among coral species. Here, 16S rRNA Illumina sequencing and functional gene array (GeoChip 5.0) were used to assess coral-associated microbial communities. Our results indicate that both host species and environmental variables significantly correlate with shifts in the microbial community structure and functional potential. Functional genes related to key biogeochemical cycles including carbon, nitrogen, sulfur and phosphorus cycling, metal homeostasis, organic remediation, antibiotic resistance and secondary metabolism were shown to significantly vary between and among the four study corals (Galaxea astreata, Porites lutea, Porites andrewsi and Pavona decussata). Genes specific for anammox were also detected for the first time in the coral holobiont and positively correlated with ammonium. This study reveals that variability in the functional potential of coral-associated microbial communities is largely driven by changes in environmental factors and further demonstrates the importance of linking environmental parameters with genomic data in complex environmental systems.

TI  - Factors influencing the replication of somatic coliphages in the water environment
T2  - ANTONIE VAN LEEUWENHOEK INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GENERAL AND MOLECULAR MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - The potential replication of somatic coliphages in the environment has been considered a drawback for their use as viral indicators, although the extent to which this affects their numbers in environmental samples has not been assessed. In this study, the replication of somatic coliphages in various conditions was assayed using suspensions containing naturally occurring somatic coliphages and Escherichia coli WG5, which is a host strain recommended for detecting somatic coliphages. The effects on phage replication of exposing strain WG5 and phages to a range of physiological conditions and the effects of the presence of suspended particles or other bacteria were also assayed. Phage replication was further tested using a strain of Klebsiella terrigena and naturally occurring E. coli cells as hosts. Our results indicate that threshold densities of both host bacterium and phages should occur simultaneously to ensure appreciable phage replication. Host cells originating from a culture in the exponential growth phase and incubation at 37 degreesC were the best conditions for phage replication in E. coli WG5. In these conditions the threshold densities required to ensure phage replication were about 10(4) host cells/ml and 10(3) phages/ ml, or 10(3) host cells/ml and 10(4) phages/ml, or intermediate values of both. The threshold densities needed for phage replication were higher when the cells proceeded from a culture in the stationary growth phase or when suspended particles or other bacteria were present. Furthermore E. coli WG5 was more efficient in supporting phage replication than either K. terrigenae or E. coli cells naturally occurring in sewage. Our results indicate that the phage and bacterium densities and the bacterial physiological conditions needed for phage replication are rarely expected to be found in the natural water environments.

TI  - Records of ticks on humans in Rio Grande do Sul state, Brazil
T2  - TICKS AND TICK-BORNE DISEASES
AB  - More than seventy tick species have been reported in Brazil. Despite the emergence of tick-borne diseases in Neotropical region, there are still limited data available on tick species parasitizing humans in Brazil. Rio Grande do Sul is the southernmost state of Brazil, comprising the only part of Brazilian territory inside the Pampa biome, as well as the transition between subtropical and temperate zones. Here, we report on human parasitism by ticks in Rio Grande do Sul state between 2004 and 2017. Seventy cases of human parasitism by ticks were recorded, with a total of 81 tick specimens collected. These included 11 tick species belonging to three genera of Ixodidae (hard-ticks), Amblyomma, Haemaphysalis and Rhipicephalus; and one genus of Argasidae, Ornithodoros. The most prevalent tick species associated to cases of human parasitism were Amblyomma parkeri (24%), Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato (22%), Amblyomma aureolatum (15%) and Amblyomma ovale (12%). A spatial analysis showed two major hot spots of human parasitism by ticks in Rio Grande do Sul state. The findings of this study highlight the need for permanent monitoring of human parasitism by ticks in order to provide a better understanding of tick and tick-borne disease eco-epidemiology, and the early identification of potential cases of tick-borne diseases, particularly in spotted fever endemic regions.

TI  - Carbon monoxide enhances the chilling tolerance of recalcitrant Baccaurea ramiflora seeds via nitric oxide-mediated glutathione homeostasis
T2  - FREE RADICAL BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE
AB  - Both carbon monoxide (CO) and nitric oxide (NO) play fundamental roles in plant responses to environmental stress. Glutathione (GSH) homeostasis through the glutathione-ascorbate cycle regulates the cellular redox status and protects the plant from damage due to reactive oxygen species (ROS) or reactive nitrogen species (RNS). Most recalcitrant seeds are sensitive to chilling stress, but the roles of and cross talk among CO, NO, ROS, and GSH in recalcitrant seeds under low temperature are not well understood. Here, we report that the germination of recalcitrant Baccaurea ramiflora seeds shows sensitivity to chilling stress, but application of exogenous CO or NO markedly increased GSH accumulation, enhanced the activities of antioxidant enzymes involved in the glutathione-ascorbate cycle, decreased the content of H2O2 and RNS, and improved the tolerance of seeds to low-temperature stress. Compared to orthodox seeds such as maize, only transient accumulation of CO and NO was induced and only a moderate increase in GSH was shown in the recalcitrant B. ramiflora seeds. Exogenous CO or NO treatment further increased the GSH accumulation and S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR) activity in B. ramiflora seeds under chilling stress. In contrast, suppressing CO or NO generation, removing GSH, or blocking GSNOR activity resulted in increases in ROS and RNS and impaired the germination of CO- or NO-induced seeds under chilling stress. Based on these results, we propose that CO acts as a novel regulator to improve the tolerance of recalcitrant seeds to low temperatures through NO-mediated glutathione homeostasis.

TI  - Comprehensive Transcriptome Meta-analysis to Characterize Host Immune Responses in Helminth Infections
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Helminth infections affect more than a third of the world's population. Despite very broad phylogenetic differences among helminth parasite species, a systemic Th2 host immune response is typically associated with long-term helminth infections, also known as the "helminth effect". Many investigations have been carried out to study host gene expression profiles during helminth infections. The objective of this study is to determine if there is a common transcriptomic signature characteristic of the helminth effect across multiple helminth species and tissue types. To this end, we performed a comprehensive meta-analysis of publicly available gene expression datasets. After data processing and adjusting for study-specific effects, we identified similar to 700 differentially expressed genes that are changed consistently during helminth infections. Functional enrichment analyses indicate that upregulated genes are predominantly involved in various immune functions, including immunomodulation, immune signaling, inflammation, pathogen recognition and antigen presentation. Down-regulated genes are mainly involved in metabolic process, with only a few of them are involved in immune regulation. This common immune gene signature confirms previous observations and indicates that the helminth effect is robust across different parasite species as well as host tissue types. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first comprehensive meta-analysis of host transcriptome profiles during helminth infections.

TI  - The use of fish in Ilhabela (Sao Paulo/Brazil): preferences, food taboos and medicinal indications
T2  - BIOTA NEOTROPICA
AB  - This study was conducted in three communities of artisanal fishermen from Ilhabela, located on the northern coast of Sao Paulo, Brazil. The objective was to analyze the preferences, taboos and medicinal indications of fish and thus representing one of the interactions of fishermen with fish stocks. Data collection was conducted through interviews with the aid of semi-structured questionnaires. We interviewed 25 families, 29 residents in three communities studied during our fieldwork for data collection. Five interviews were done in Jabaquara Beach, 6 in Fome Beach and 14 Serraria Beach. During the interviews, 18 species were cited as preferred for consumption, 11 species considered to be taboo (food prohibited), 5 species were cited as avoided as food, and 4 species indicated in case of illness. The families of fishermen prefer to consume finfish and do not consume puffer fish, the latter probably due to its toxic characteristic. Fish such as little tunny, largehead hairtail, shark, serra mackerel and king mackerel are avoided by unhealthy people and in cases of wounds, inflammation, pregnancy and postpartum. Other fish, such as sea chubs, silver porgy, bluefish and grouper are reported as medicinal in these situations. Aspects related to fish consumption are part of the knowledge of fishermen and their families and provide a wealth of information that combined to biological information is useful for the conservation of fishery resources. Data such as those presented in this study, regarding the use of aquatic animals for treatment of diseases, could serve as a basis for future studies on substances that contain active elements in curing diseases.

TI  - Schistosomiasis Prevalence and Intensity of Infection in Latin America and the Caribbean Countries, 1942-2014: A Systematic Review in the Context of a Regional Elimination Goal
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   In 2012 the World Health Assembly adopted resolution WHA65.21 on elimination of schistosomiasis, calling for increased investment in schistosomiasis control and support for countries to initiate elimination programs. This study aims to analyze prevalence and intensity of Schistosoma mansoni infection in children in Latin America and the Caribbean countries and territories (LAC), at the second administrative level or lower.
   Methodology
   A systematic review of schistosomiasis prevalence and intensity of infection was conducted by searching at PubMed, LILACS and EMBASE. Experts on the topic were informally consulted and institutional web pages were reviewed (PAHO/WHO, Ministries of Health). Only SCH infection among children was registered because it can be a 'proxi-indicator' of recent transmission by the time the study is conducted.
   Principal Findings
   One hundred thirty two full-text articles met the inclusion criteria and provided 1,242 prevalence and 199 intensity of infection data points. Most of them were from Brazil (69.7%). Only Brazil published studies after 2001, showing several 'hot spots' with high prevalence. Brazil, Venezuela, Suriname and Saint Lucia need to update the epidemiological status of schistosomiasis to re-design their national programs and target the elimination of Schistosoma mansoni transmission by 2020. In Antigua and Barbuda, Dominican Republic, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Montserrat and Puerto Rico schistosomiasis transmission may be interrupted. However the compilation of an elimination dossier and follow-up surveys, per WHO recommendations, are needed to verify that status. Hence, the burden of subtle SCH chronic infection may be still present and even high in countries that may have eliminated transmission. Heterogeneity in the methodologies used for monitoring and evaluating the progress of the schistosomiasis programs was found, making cross-national and chronological comparisons difficult.
   Conclusions
   There is a need for updating the schistosomiasis status in the historically endemic countries and territories in LAC to address the required public health interventions for control and elimination programs or to verify the elimination of transmission of Schistosoma mansoni. Improved reporting and standardization of the monitoring and evaluation methodologies used are recommended, while using available WHO guidelines. Meeting a regional elimination goal will require additional and improved epidemiological data by age group and sex.

TI  - APOPTOSIS OF T-LYMPHOCYTES IN THE SPINAL-CORD LESIONS IN HTLV-I-ASSOCIATED MYELOPATHY - A POSSIBLE MECHANISM TO CONTROL VIRAL-INFECTION IN THE CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEUROPATHOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL NEUROLOGY
AB  - Immunocytochemical staining of spinal cords from five autopsied patients with HAM/TSP was performed using the monoclonal antibody TIA-1, a marker of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). Many TIA-1+, CD8+ cells are distributed in active inflammatory lesions. The number of TIA-1+ cells is related to the amount of HTLV-I proviral DNA in situ. The protein TIA-1 has been associated with the induction of apoptosis in target cells. In active inflammatory lesions, we found cells undergoing apoptosis, most of them identified as helper-inducer CD45RO T lymphocytes, which were consistent with in vivo cellular tropism of HTLV-I in patients with HAM/TSP. These findings suggest that CTL-induced apoptosis of T lymphocytes may be one of the possible mechanisms which eliminate HTLV-I-infected cells from the central nervous system. In addition, many T lymphocytes in the inflammatory lesions expressed bcl-2 oncoprotein, suggesting that infiltrated T lymphocytes may be resistant to apoptosis. Expression of bcl-2 oncoprotein may explain the longstanding inflammatory process in the central nervous system of HAM/TSP

AB  - We test the hypothesis that climate and environmental conditions are becoming favorable for dengue transmission in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Sea Level Pressure (SLP), Mean Sea Level (MSL), Wind, Sea Surface Temperature (SST), Air Surface Temperature (AST), Rainfall, and confirmed dengue cases were analyzed. We evaluated the dengue incidence and environmental data with Principal Component Analysis, Pearson correlation coefficient, Mann-Kendall trend test and logistic regressions. Results indicated that dry days are increasing and wet days are decreasing. MSL is increasing, posing higher risk of dengue as the perimeter of the San Juan Bay estuary expands and shorelines move inland. Warming is evident with both SST and AST. Maximum and minimum air surface temperature extremes have increased. Between 1992 and 2011, dengue transmission increased by a factor of 3.4 (95% CI: 1.9-6.1) for each 1 degrees C increase in SST. For the period 2007-2011 alone, dengue incidence reached a factor of 5.2 (95% CI: 1.9-13.9) for each 1 degrees C increase in SST. Teenagers are consistently the age group that suffers the most infections in San Juan. Results help understand possible impacts of different climate change scenarios in planning for social adaptation and public health interventions.

TI  - Alien Invasion: Biology of <i>Philornis</i> Flies Highlighting <i>Philornis downsi</i>, an Introduced Parasite of Galapagos Birds
T2  - ANNUAL REVIEW OF ENTOMOLOGY, VOL 63
AB  - The muscid genus Philornis comprises approximately 50 described species of flies, nearly all of which are obligate parasites of nestling birds. Philornis species are native to the Neotropics and widely distributed from Florida to Argentina. Most research on this group has focused on P. downsi, which was introduced to the Galapagos Islands in the late twentieth century. Although Philornis parasitism kills nestlings in several native host species, nowhere do the effects seem more severe than in P. downsi in the Galapagos. Here, we review studies of native and introduced Philornis in an attempt to identify factors that may influence virulence and consider implications for the conservation of hosts in the Galapagos.

TI  - Genetic characterization of <i>Strongyloides</i> spp. from captive, semi-captive and wild Bornean orangutans (<i>Pongo pygmaeus</i>) in Central and East Kalimantan, Borneo, Indonesia
T2  - PARASITOLOGY
AB  - Orangutans (Pongo spp.), Asia's only great apes, are threatened in their survival due to habitat loss, hunting and infections. Nematodes of the genus Strongyloides may represent a severe cause of death in wild and captive individuals. In order to better understand which Strongyloides species/subspecies infect orangutans under different conditions, larvae were isolated from fecal material collected in Indonesia from 9 captive, 2 semi-captive and 9 wild individuals, 18 captive groups of Bornean orangutans and from 1 human working with wild orangutans. Genotyping was done at the genomic rDNA locus (part of the 18S rRNA gene and internal transcribed spacer 1, ITS1) by sequencing amplicons. Thirty isolates, including the one from the human, could be identified as S. fuelleborni fuelleborni with 18S rRNA gene identities of 98.5-100%, with a corresponding published sequence. The ITS1 sequences could be determined for 17 of these isolates revealing a huge variability and 2 main clusters without obvious pattern with regard to attributes of the hosts. The ITS1 amplicons of 2 isolates were cloned and sequenced, revealing considerable variability indicative of mixed infections. One isolate from a captive individual was identified as S. stercoralis (18S rRNA) and showed 99% identity (ITS1) with S. stercoralis sequences from geographically distinct locations and host species. The findings are significant with regard to the zoonotic nature of these parasites and might contribute to the conservation of remaining orangutan populations.

TI  - DESIGN AND EVALUATION OF BACTEROIDES DNA PROBES FOR THE SPECIFIC DETECTION OF HUMAN FECAL POLLUTION
T2  - APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Because Bacteroides spp. are obligate anaerobes that dominate the human fecal flora, and because some species may live only in the human intestine, these bacteria might be useful to distinguish human from nonhuman sources of fecal pollution. To test this hypothesis, PCR primers specific for 16S rRNA gene sequences of Bacteroides distasonis, B. thetaiotaomicron, and B. vulgatus were designed. Hybridization with species-specific internal probes was used to detect the intended PCR products. Extracts from 66 known Bacteroides strains, representing 10 related species, were used to confirm the specificity of these PCR-hybridization assays. To test for specificity in feces, procedures were developed to prepare DNA of sufficient purity for PCR, Extracts of feces from 9 humans and 70 nonhumans (cats, dogs, cattle, hogs, horses, sheep, goats, and chickens) were each analyzed with and without an internal positive control to verify that PCR amplification was not inhibited by substances in the extract. In addition, serial dilutions from each extract that tested positive were assayed to estimate the relative abundance of target Bacteroides spp. in the sample. Depending on the primer-probe set used, either 78 or 67% of the human fecal extracts tested had high levels of target DNA. On the other hand, only 7 to 11% of the nonhuman extracts tested had similarly high levels of target DNA. An additional 12 to 20% of the nonhuman extracts had levels of target DNA that were 100- to 1,000-fold lower than those found in humans, Although the B. vulgatus probes detected high levels of their target DNA in most of the house pets, similarly high levels of target DNA were found only in a few individuals from other groups of nonhumans. Therefore, the results indicate that these probes can distinguish human from nonhuman feces in many cases.

TI  - Improving plantain (<i>Musa</i> spp. AAB) yields on smallholder farms in West and Central Africa
T2  - FOOD SECURITY
AB  - Plantain is an important staple in West and Central Africa, where it is predominantly grown by smallholder farmers. On-farm data are rare but yields are considered to be low. We collated actual yields in the region, reviewed regional plantain research published from 1976 to 2013, then estimated what yields would be attainable on smallholder farms if the proven, best-fit innovations were adopted. Mean actual yields reported ranged from 2.9 to 8.9 Mg ha(-1) with a mean of 5.7 Mg ha(-1) for False horn plantain and 4.5 to 10.2 Mg ha(-1) with a mean of 7.8 Mg ha(-1) for French plantain. Experiments found dealt with: cultural practices, particularly intercropping; abiotic factors such as fertiliser, mulch application and irrigation; biotic factors, predominantly sucker sanitation methods, but including three controlled yield loss studies on nematodes and black sigatoka; landrace comparisons and the introduction of improved cultivars, predominantly those exhibiting black sigatoka-tolerance. We conclude that intercropping should be retained according to farmer preference as there was no evidence of yield reductions for plantain. Boiling water treatment of suckers should be universally recommended. Inputs, whether mulch or K fertiliser up to 300 kg ha(-1), should be applied as both reduced plant losses and increased bunch mass. With the highest yielding local landrace type, on-farm yields could be increased from 7.8 Mg ha(-1) to 35.5 Mg ha(-1) with purchased inputs or to 23.7 Mg ha(-1) without purchased inputs.

TI  - Laboratory and field evaluation of brown dog tick behavioral responses to potential semiochemicals
T2  - TICKS AND TICK-BORNE DISEASES
AB  - The brown dog tick, Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato (Parasitiformis: Ixodidae), is an ectoparasite of dogs that can be found worldwide. This tick poses unique difficulties in management because it can complete its entire life cycle indoors and has demonstrated acaricide resistance. The ability to monitor for tick presence and abundance is necessary for developing effective control programs. As such, an evaluation of adult brown dog tick behavioral responses to 16 potential semiochemicals was undertaken using Y-tube and straight-tube olfactometers. Both sexes of ticks were activated by nine of the 16 semiochemicals tested, including 300 mu g of 1-octen-3-ol, benzaldehyde, benzyl alcohol, hexanoic acid, nonanoic acid, methyl salicylate, o-nitrophenol, 2,6-dichlorophenol and salicylaldehyde. Rhipicephalus sanguineus s.l. behaviors including movement speed, direction and duration, as well as turning, were quantified following exposure to the same nine chemicals in a straight-tube olfactometer, individually at 300 mu g and as mixtures. Three individual chemicals, 1-octen-3-ol, hexanoic acid, and methyl salicylate induced strong responses. These three chemicals were evaluated in a semi-field setting using a modified bed bug trap but were found to provide no significant increase in attraction compared with CO2 alone. The results of these studies provide a foundation for future research regarding semiochemicals of R. sanguineus s.l. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - Bats represent the second largest mammal group, with over 1400 known species dispersed across six continents. Bats are unique in many ways. Notably, their incredible longevity, with a life span of up to ten times longer than what might be expected from their body size and a unique ability to tolerate viruses without displaying any symptoms, means they provide an area of particular importance from a disease risk perspective. In addition, the warm, humid environments in which bats occur provide ideal habitats for fungi to grow, and the bats potentially carry various

TI  - Fiber-based tissue engineering: Progress, challenges, and opportunities
T2  - BIOTECHNOLOGY ADVANCES
AB  - Tissue engineering aims to improve the function of diseased or damaged organs by creating biological substitutes. To fabricate a functional tissue, the engineered construct should mimic the physiological environment including its structural, topographical, and mechanical properties. Moreover, the construct should facilitate nutrients and oxygen diffusion as well as removal of metabolic waste during tissue regeneration. In the last decade, fiber-based techniques such as weaving, knitting, braiding, as well as electrospinning, and direct writing have emerged as promising platforms for making 3D tissue constructs that can address the abovementioned challenges. Here, we critically review the techniques used to form cell-free and cell-laden fibers and to assemble them into scaffolds. We compare their mechanical properties, morphological features and biological activity. We discuss current challenges and future opportunities of fiber-based tissue engineering (FBTE) for use in research and clinical practice. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Climate and Non-Climate Drivers of Dengue Epidemics in Southern Coastal Ecuador
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - We report a statistical mixed model for assessing the importance of climate and non-climate drivers of interannual variability in dengue fever in southern coastal Ecuador. Local climate data and Pacific sea surface temperatures (Oceanic Nino Index [ONI]) were used to predict dengue standardized morbidity ratios (SMRs; 1995-2010). Unobserved confounding factors were accounted for using non-structured yearly random effects. We found that ONI, rainfall, and minimum temperature were positively associated with dengue, with more cases of dengue during El Nino events. We assessed the influence of non-climatic factors on dengue SMR using a subset of data (2001-2010) and found that the percent of households with Aedes aegypti immatures was also a significant predictor. Our results indicate that monitoring the climate and non-climate drivers identified in this study could provide some predictive lead for forecasting dengue epidemics, showing the potential to develop a dengue early-warning system in this region.

TI  - Rickettsia communities and their relationship with tick species within and around the national park of Iguaçu, Brazil
T2  - EXPERIMENTAL AND APPLIED ACAROLOGY
AB  - We report Rickettsia species from 2,334 ticks collected from environment (1,939 ticks) and animals (395 ticks) in the largest inland fragment of the Atlantic rainforest of southern Brazil and its fragments. Additionally, the DNA infection rates of Amblyomma ovale tick populations in the Neotropics with Rickettsia bellii and Rickettsia parkeri strain Atlantic rainforest were calculated using data from scientific publications, and their correlation was evaluated. From 11 tick species Rickettsia DNA was detected in seven (Amblyomma brasiliense, Amblyomma coelebs, Amblyomma incisum, Amblyomma longirostre, A. ovale, Haemaphysalis juxtakochi, Ixodes fuscipes) and was not detected in four species (Amblyomma dubitatum, Ixodes loricatus, Rhipicephalus microplus and Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato). DNA of five Rickettsia species was detected (R. bellii, Rickettsia amblyommatis, Rickettsia rhipicephali, Rickettsia felis and Rickettsia sp. Aragaoi). To determine the prevalence of Rickettsia DNA positivity according to vector species, ticks were processed individually or in pools of 2-10 individuals (samples). The most prevalent Rickettsia species was R. bellii, found in 112 samples, followed by R. amblyommatis, R. rhipicephali, R. felis and Rickettsia sp. Aragaoi, found in 16, five, two and one sample, respectively. Rickettsia bellii DNA was found in five tick species with the highest infection rate in A. ovale and A. brasiliense. Absence of R. parkeri strain Atlantic rainforest in A. ovale ticks was an unexpected result. Furthermore, a negative correlation was identified between the infection rates (DNA) of R. bellii and/or R. parkeri strain Atlantic rainforest within A. ovale tick populations in the Neotropics. Putting together current knowledge, it can be proposed that, within natural settings, the diversity of rickettsiae and ticks creates a buffering effect on the overgrowth of rickettsiae and episodes of bacteremia in the hosts.

TI  - SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPY OF EGGS OF <i>SABETHES CYANEUS</i>
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MOSQUITO CONTROL ASSOCIATION
AB  - Mosquitoes of the Neotropical genus Sabethes, some species of which are yellow fever vectors, most often develop through the immature stages in tree holes. Sabethes eggs have not been previously characterized using scanning electron microscopy. Eggs of Sabethes cyaneus (length: 349.6 +/- 2.7 mu m; width: 172.6 +/- 1.14 mu m; n = 10) are almost biconical when examined from the top. From a lateral perspective 2 surfaces can be seen. One surface is smooth and more convex, whereas the other is less convex and partially covered by a network from which many fungiform tubercles arise. The micropyle is situated on the smooth surface of the pointed anterior tip and is surrounded by an irregular row of tubercles, some of which are leaf shaped. No structures possibly involved in adhesion to surfaces are visible. When hatching, the egg splits dorsoventrally approximately two-thirds of the length from the anterior end. The tubercles appear to be water repellent, and the more convex/smoother surface is downturned, and this position on water was confirmed by direct observation. The eggs float free on the water surface.

TI  - The impact of incorporating surgical simulation into trichiasis surgery training on operative aspects of initial live-training surgeries
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - BackgroundWhile surgical simulation is regularly used in surgical training in high-income country settings, it is uncommon in low- and middle-income countries, particularly for surgical training that primarily occurs in rural areas. We designed and evaluated a novel surgical simulator for improving trachomatous trichiasis (TT) surgery training, given that trichiasis is mostly found among the poorest individuals in rural areas. Methodology/Principal findingsTT surgery programs were invited to incorporate surgical simulation with a new, high fidelity, low-cost simulator into their training. Trainees completed standard TT-surgery training following World Health Organization guidelines. A subset of trainees received three hours of supplemental training with the simulator between classroom and live-surgery training. We recorded the time required to complete each surgery and the number of times the trainer intervened to correct surgical steps. Participants completed questionnaires regarding their perceptions. We also assessed trainer and trainee perceptions of surgical simulation training as part of trichiasis surgery training.22 surgeons completed standard training and 26 completed standard training plus simulation. We observed 1,394 live-training surgeries. Average time to first live-training surgery completion was nearly 20% shorter the simulation versus the standard group (vs 34.4 minutes; p = 0.02). Trainers intervened significantly fewer times during initial live-training surgeries in the simulation group (2.7 vs. 4.8; p = 0.005). All trainers indicated the simulator significantly improved training by allowing trainees to practice safely and to identify problem areas before performing live-training surgeries. Trainees reported that simulation practice improved their confidence and skills prior to performing live-training surgeries. ConclusionsA single high-fidelity surgical simulation session can significantly improve critical aspects of initial TT surgeries.
   Author summaryApproximately 1.7 million people globally have an eyelid condition called trachomatous trichiasis (TT) resulting from repeated ocular bacterial infections that caused the eyelid to scar and turn in so that the eyelashes rub against the eye. TT can be corrected through surgery. However, TT is mostly found in areas with limited health care resources. Thus, nurses are trained how to perform the surgery. Historically, training has been limited to one week of classroom training followed by three weeks of live-surgery practical training. This study describes a surgical simulator the authors developed to improve the training process. After a three-hour training with the HEAD START simulator, trainees required less assistance from the trainer during live-patient surgical practice and performed surgery faster than those not trained on HEAD START.

T2  - JOURNAL OF VENOMOUS ANIMALS AND TOXINS INCLUDING TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - The hydroalcoholic extract of Casearia gossypiosperma Briquet (Flacourtiaceae) was standardized for the first time through quality control procedures including pharmacognostic methods, fingerprint chromatograms, defined amounts of marker substances and physicochemical characteristics. The pharmacological activity of C. gossypiosperma (Cg) hydroalcoholic extract was assayed by a traditional in vitro test, which involved irreversible neuromuscular blockade induced by Bothrops jararacussu (Bjssu) venom (60 mu g/mL) in mouse phrenic nerve-diaphragm preparations. Bjssu venom blocked muscle activity for 26 (+/- 2.0) minutes (n = 6). Cg extract (0.1 mg/mL) induced changes on the baseline muscle activity without impairing the muscle function and inhibited 87.6% (+/- 1.8) (n = 6) of the Bjssu venom-induced blockade. Both flavonoids (0.624 g%) and polyphenols (4.63 g%) from the extract were spectrophotometrically quantified. Therefore, the present study confirms the antibothropic activity of Cg extract, supporting the ethnomedical use of Casearia sp. in the treatment of snakebite victims.

TI  - Improving the prediction of African savanna vegetation variables using time series of MODIS products
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
AB  - African savanna vegetation is subject to extensive degradation as a result of rapid climate and land use change. To better understand these changes detailed assessment of vegetation structure is needed across an extensive spatial scale and at a fine temporal resolution. Applying remote sensing techniques to savanna vegetation is challenging due to sparse cover, high background soil signal, and difficulty to differentiate between spectral signals of bare soil and dry vegetation. In this paper, we attempt to resolve these challenges by analyzing time series of four MODIS Vegetation Products (VPs): Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Leaf Area Index (LAI), and Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FPAR) for Etosha National Park, a semiarid savanna in north-central Namibia. We create models to predict the density, cover, and biomass of the main savanna vegetation forms: grass, shrubs, and trees. To calibrate remote sensing data we developed an extensive and relatively rapid field methodology and measured herbaceous and woody vegetation during both the dry and wet seasons. We compared the efficacy of the four MODIS-derived VPs in predicting vegetation field measured variables. We then compared the optimal time span of VP time series to predict ground-measured vegetation. We found that Multiyear Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR) models were superior to single year or single date models. Our results show that NDVI-based PLSR models yield robust prediction of tree density (R-2 = 0.79, relative Root Mean Square Error, rRMSE = 1.9%) and tree cover (R-2 = 0.78, rRMSE = 0.3%). EVI provided the best model for shrub density (R-2 = 0.82) and shrub cover (R-2 = 0.83), but was only marginally superior over models based on other VPs. FPAR was the best predictor of vegetation biomass of trees (R-2 = 0.76), shrubs (R-2 = 0.83), and grass (R-2 = 0.91). Finally, we addressed an enduring challenge in the remote sensing of semiarid vegetation by examining the transferability of predictive models through space and time. Our results show that models created in the wetter part of Etosha could accurately predict trees' and shrubs' variables in the drier part of the reserve and vice versa. Moreover, our results demonstrate that models created for vegetation variables in the dry season of 2011 could be successfully applied to predict vegetation in the wet season of 2012. We conclude that extensive field data combined with multiyear time series of MODIS vegetation products can produce robust predictive models for multiple vegetation forms in the African savanna. These methods advance the monitoring of savanna vegetation dynamics and contribute to improved management and conservation of these valuable ecosystems.

TI  - Direct association between rainfall and non-typhoidal <i>Salmonella</i> bloodstream infections in hospital-admitted children in the Democratic Republic of Congo
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) ranks first among causes of bloodstream infection in children under five years old in the Democratic Republic of Congo and has a case fatality rate of 15%. Main host-associated risk factors are Plasmodium falciparum malaria, anemia and malnutrition. NTS transmission in sub-Saharan Africa is poorly understood. NTS bloodstream infections mostly occur during the rainy season, which may reflect seasonal variation in either environmental transmission or host susceptibility. We hypothesized that environment- and host-associated factors contribute independently to the seasonal variation in NTS bloodstream infections in children under five years old admitted to Kisantu referral hospital in 2013-2019. We used remotely sensed rainfall and temperature data as proxies for environmental factors and hospital data for host-associated factors. We used principal component analysis to disentangle the interrelated environment- and host-associated factors. With timeseries regression, we demonstrated a direct association between rainfall and NTS variation, independent of host-associated factors. While the latter explained 17.5% of NTS variation, rainfall explained an additional 9%. The direct association with rainfall points to environmental NTS transmission, which should be explored by environmental sampling studies. Environmental and climate change may increase NTS transmission directly or via host susceptibility, which highlights the importance of preventive public health interventions.

TI  - FIRST RECORD OF A SPECIES OF MERMITHIDAE BRAUN, 1883 INFECTING A DECAPOD, <i>PALAEMON PALUDOSUS</i> (PALAEMONIDAE)
T2  - JOURNAL OF PARASITOLOGY
AB  - The hemocoel of 26 of 30 (86%) eastern grass shrimps, Palaemon paludosus (Gibbes, 1850) (Decapoda: Palaemonidae), captured during June 2017 from several freshwater lakes near Leesburg and Lake Kissimmee, Florida, was infected by juveniles of a nematode species (Mermithidae sp.). Some infected eastern grass shrimps were preserved whole for histopathology, whereas others were dissected to excise parasitic juvenile nematodes, and still others were kept alive in glass aquaria such that post-parasitic (emerged) juvenile nematodes could be opportunistically observed alive and ultimately preserved. Parasitic and post-parasitic juvenile nematodes had cuticle cross-fibers, cephalic papillae, cup-shaped amphids, a horn-shaped vagina, a trophosome, and a caudal appendage, which collectively diagnosed them as Mermithidae sp. They differed from those of nematomorphs (Nematomorpha) by lacking 4 giant cells anteriorly, tegumental bristles, scale or plate-like areoles, a bifurcate or trifurcate posterior end, and an anus. A phylogenetic analysis of the small subunit rDNA (18S) that included all of the available mermithid sequences corresponding to morphologically diagnosed specimens recovered Mermithidae sp. within the clade of mermithids and sister to Ovomermis sinensis Chen, Jian, and Ren, 1991. This is the first record of a mermithid infection in a decapod and first report of a mermithid infection in an aquatic crustacean from North America (another mermithid infects a terrestrial isopod there). The high prevalence of infection and the multiple geographic localities harboring infected eastern grass shrimps indicated that these infections were not spurious. Because no other decapod is confirmed as a mermithid host, we suspect that these specimens likely represent a new species with a life cycle worth studying, since none for a mermithid involving a decapod nor a crustacean has been elucidated to date. We also provide a table of all mermithid and nematomorph infections in crustaceans.

TI  - Happily together forever: temporal variation in spatial patterns and complete lack of territoriality in a promiscuous rodent
T2  - POPULATION ECOLOGY
AB  - The availability of resources, their effect on population density and territoriality, and the ways in which these factors are interwoven with mating systems are important determinants of small mammal space use. It is often difficult to study these patterns in an integrated way, however, especially because long-term data are needed but not readily available. In this paper, we investigate effects of population density, season and breeding status on home range patterns of the promiscuous rodent Mastomys natalensis using monthly capture-mark-recapture data collected over 17 years in a 3-ha grid. Home ranges were estimated using minimum convex polygons bounded by trap locations, and home range overlap and visitation rates were calculated as a measure of territoriality. As higher population densities coincide with increased resource availability, we predicted that home range sizes would correlate negatively with density. Furthermore, as M. natalensis is promiscuous and population densities are generally high, we predicted that territoriality would be low, and home range overlap would therefore be high. Contrary to expectations the home ranges of female adults increased with population density, although those of male adults and subadults followed the expected decrease. Home range overlap and visitation rates were generally high, and increased significantly with population density. More importantly, they were never lower than those of simulated datasets consisting of randomly moved home ranges. These results therefore suggest that M. natalensis displays a complete lack of territoriality that is rarely seen in small mammals but still meets predictions based on knowledge of density and mating system.

TI  - Can anti-bothropstoxin-I antibodies discriminate between Bothrops jararaca and Bothrops jararacussu venoms?
T2  - JOURNAL OF VENOMOUS ANIMALS AND TOXINS INCLUDING TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background: Snakes of the genus Bothrops, popularly known as pit vipers, are responsible for most cases of snakebite in Brazil. Within this genus, Bothrops jararacussu and B. jararaca deserve special attention due to the severity of their bites and for inhabiting densely populated areas. Regarding the treatment of snakebites by Bothrops jararacussu, questions have been raised about the effectiveness of the specific bothropic antivenom in neutralizing myotoxic effects; however, there are no accurate data for humans. Thus, the development of a differential diagnostic kit for this species would be of great interest because it provides, for healthcare professionals, a tool that would allow us to determine whether the accident was caused by B. jararacussu or other species of the genus. It would also make it possible to evaluate the specificity of the treatment and to provide data for epidemiological studies.
   Methods: First, we produced a species-specific polyclonal antibody -a potential biomarker of Bothrops jararacussu venom -against bothropstoxin-I ( BthTx-I), which is also found in smaller quantities in the venoms of B. jararaca from southern Brazil.
   Results: Polyclonal antibodies against bothropstoxin-I could be separated into several species-specific immunoglobulins. Then, aiming to develop a system of safe and standardized immunoassay, we produced monoclonal antibodies. Seven hybridomas were obtained. Five of them were specific to the venom of B. jararacussu and two recognized the venom of B. jararaca from the southeastern population. The use of monoclonal antibodies also made it possible to differentiate B. jararacussu from B. jararaca venom obtained from the southern population. Analyzing the reactivity of monoclonal antibodies against other bothropic venoms, we found mAb Bt-3 to be more specific than others for B. jararacussu venom.
   Conclusions: These results show the potential of BthTx-I for producing monoclonal antibodies that differentiate between B. jararacussu and other Bothrops species venoms.

TI  - Impact of controlled sugarcane straw burning on local insect community
T2  - NEOTROPICAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - The previous burning of sugarcane straw before harvest causes a series of inconvenients to the environment, specially to the tillage-associated insects. Fire is used to control pests and diseases in the agriculture, however its effect on insect populations is not well understood or documented, mainly on invertebrate groups responsible for nutrient recycling and energy flow. Our objective was to evaluate the effect of controlled burning sugarcane straw on the local insect community. The insects were collected in different dates before and after burning. The species selected for the analysis were affected by fire. Among the 35 taxa collected, 17 were considered more relevant to explain the observed variation in the frequency of species captured through time. In the first sampling after burning, there was a decrease in abundance of five species [Nitidulidae (species 2; Coleoptera), Lutosa brasiliensis (Brunner von Watternwyl) (Orthoptera: Gryllacrididae), Phoridae e Drosophilidae (Diptera) e Labia minor L. (Dermaptera: Labiidae)], among the 17 species selected for analysis. The canonical variate analysis for different sampling dates indicated significant difference between treatments, considering the composition and the species abundance. Despite the different composition of the insect community observed before and after burning, there is a tendency of community recovery to the observed pattern before burning.

TI  - Biogeographical patterns and processes in the genus group Scotussae (Acrididae: Melanoplinae): an integrative approach
T2  - BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY
AB  - A biogeographical study of the genus group Scotussae, a clade of grasshoppers endemic to the subtropical temperate region of the La Plata Basin, South America, was performed within a phylogenetic context to test whether wing reduction reflects evolutionary and ecological processes within the clade. We used an integrative biogeographical approach to determine the role of geohistorical events, geography, ecology and phylogenetic niche conservatism on the distribution and diversification processes of the group. We performed a total evidence phylogenetic analysis and tested the phylogenetic signal of ecological niche traits (niche optimum and niche breadth). We also assessed the degree to which phylogenetic distance is correlated with geographical and ecological niche traits and we used BioGeoBEARS to estimate ancestral ranges. The results provided evidence for phylogenetic niche conservatism as well as a significant association between phylogeny and both geographical and, more strongly, ecological traits. Two main clades were clearly associated with wing development, and evidence points to the evolutionary and ecological processes within these two groups being different. The Brachypterous clade shows evidence that allopatric speciation was the main source of diversification, while for the Macropterous clade sympatric speciation seems more likely.

TI  - The good, the bad and the ugly: framing debates on nature in a One Health community
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE
AB  - Originating in medical and veterinary spheres, the One Health concept stands as an open call for collaboration also between these disciplines or professions and those of environmental and social science. However, the communities of practice in question show uneasy or under-developed collaborations, due to a variety of factors. We argue that an important factor is the way issues are raised and questions are formulated, i.e., their framing. Based on complementary perspectives on health and knowledge, this overview provides an inter- and trans-disciplinary analysis of the role of the framing of << nature >> in One Health discourses as a barrier or a facilitator to collaboration, as revealed by the scientific literature. We find that the lack of reflection by scientists about the framing under which they operate appears as a major factor of misunderstanding between disciplines, and a barrier for inter- and trans-disciplinary solutions to improve management of health risks and benefits. Hence, to build such solutions, framing will have to be a conscious and repeated step in the process, acknowledging and explaining the diversity of viewpoints and values. The interdisciplinary dialogues inherent in this process promote translation between scientific domains, policy-makers and citizens, with a critical but pluralistic recourse to various framings of health risks and benefits associated with nature, and a deep awareness of their practical and ethical consequences.

TI  - Population genetic structure of the Asian bush mosquito, <i>Aedes japonicus</i> (Diptera, Culicidae), in Belgium suggests multiple introductions
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
AB  - BackgroundAedes japonicus japonicus has expanded beyond its native range and has established in multiple European countries, including Belgium. In addition to the population located at Natoye, Belgium, locally established since 2002, specimens were recently collected along the Belgian border. The first objective of this study was therefore to investigate the origin of these new introductions, which were assumed to be related to the expansion of the nearby population in western Germany. Also, an intensive elimination campaign was undertaken at Natoye between 2012 and 2015, after which the species was declared to be eradicated. This species was re-detected in 2017, and thus the second objective was to investigate if these specimens resulted from a new introduction event and/or from a few undetected specimens that escaped the elimination campaign.MethodsPopulation genetic variation at nad4 and seven microsatellite loci was surveyed in 224 and 68 specimens collected in Belgium and Germany, respectively. German samples were included as reference to investigate putative introduction source(s). At Natoye, 52 and 135 specimens were collected before and after the elimination campaign, respectively, to investigate temporal changes in the genetic composition and diversity.ResultsAt Natoye, the genotypic microsatellite make-up showed a clear difference before and after the elimination campaign. Also, the population after 2017 displayed an increased allelic richness and number of private alleles, indicative of new introduction(s). However, the Natoye population present before the elimination programme is believed to have survived at low density. At the Belgian border, clustering results suggest a relation with the western German population. Whether the introduction(s) occur via passive human-mediated ground transport or, alternatively, by natural spread cannot be determined yet from the dataset.ConclusionFurther introductions within Belgium are expected to occur in the near future, especially along the eastern Belgian border, which is at the front of the invasion of Ae. japonicus towards the west. Our results also point to the complexity of controlling invasive species, since 4 years of intense control measures were found to be not completely successful at eliminating this exotic at Natoye.

TI  - Periodicity of Capture of the <i>Anopheles darlingi</i> Root (Diptera: Culicidae) in Porto Velho, Rondonia, Brazil
T2  - NEOTROPICAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - Anopheles darlingi Root is the principal malaria vector in Amazonia region. The objectives of this work were to study the periodicity of Anopheles darlingi Root, the host preference for peri or extra-domestic environments and the parous rate in four field sites in Porto Velho (RO) by human-landing. All of the Anopheles specimens collected were identified, but only A. darlingi was dissected for the parous study. The results showed that human-landing colleted a total of 985 anophelines, with A. darlingi (972) being the most abundant species. Female mosquitoes were more abundant at extra-domestic environments in two of the locations studied (Sao Joao e Candeias do Jamari) (P < 0.05). The parous rate was 96% and no periodicity was observed for captures of females of A. darlingi in the field sites.

TI  - Neurotrophic Effects of Leukemia Inhibitory Factor on Neural Cells Derived from Human Embryonic Stem Cells
T2  - STEM CELLS
AB  - Various growth factor cocktails have been used to proliferate and then differentiate human neural progenitor (NP) cells derived from embryonic stem cells (ESC) for in vitro and in vivo studies. However, the cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) has been largely overlooked. Here, we demonstrate that LIF significantly enhanced in vitro survival and promoted differentiation of human ESC-derived NP cells. In NP cells, as well as NP-derived neurons, LIF reduced caspase-mediated apoptosis and reduced both spontaneous and H2O2-induced reactive oxygen species in culture. In vitro, NP cell proliferation and the yield of differentiated neurons were significantly higher in the presence of LIF. In NP cells, LIF enhanced cMyc phosphorylation, commonly associated with self-renewal/proliferation. Also, in differentiating NP cells LIF activated the phosphoinositide 3-kinase and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 pathways, associated with cell survival and reduced apoptosis. When differentiated in LIF+ media, neurite outgrowth and ERK1/2 phosphorylation were potentiated together with increased expression of gp130, a component of the LIF receptor complex. NP cells, pretreated in vitro with LIF, were effective in reducing infarct volume in a model of focal ischemic stroke but LIF did not lead to significantly improved initial NP cell survival over nontreated NP cells. Our results show that LIF signaling significantly promotes human NP cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation in vitro. Activated LIF signaling should be considered in cell culture expansion systems for future human NP cell-based therapeutic transplant studies. STEM CELLS2012;30:23872399

TI  - First parasitological, histopathological and molecular characterization of <i>Echinococcus vogeli</i> Rausch and Bernstein, 1972 from <i>Cuniculus paca</i> Linnaeus, 1766 in the Cerrado biome (Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil)
T2  - VETERINARY PARASITOLOGY
AB  - Polycystic echinococcosis (PE) is caused by Echinococcus vogeli metacestodes (larval stage) in Neotropical countries. E. vogeli is trophically-transmitted between predators bush dogs (Speothos venaticus) and prey pacas (Cuniculus paca). In Brazil, reported PE cases are restricted to the Amazon biome. In this study, metacestodes from a paca hunted in Mato Grosso do Sul state (Cerrado biome) were identified morphological and histopathological techniques and further confirmed by molecular testing (sequencing of cytochrome C oxidase subunit I (cox1) gene) for the first time. Images of the whole liver showed superficial bubble-like hepatic masses. The parasitological analysis revealed large hooks (41.3 +/- 1.2 mu m length/12.8 +/- 0.8 mu m width) and small hooks (33.0 +/- 1.5 mu m length/11.1 +/- 1.2 mu m width), consistent with E. vogeli. Microscopically, the liver showed protoscoleces, a thick laminated layer, fibrosis, and inflammatory infiltrate in the adventitial layer. The DNA sequencing confirmed E. vogeli with 99% homology with sequences deposited in the GenBank. In addition, this finding greatly extends the geographic range of animal polycystic echinococcosis into the Cerrado. It is likely to occur in new biomes, where bush dogs and pacas share a given area in a trophic relationship.

TI  - Bauerenol Acetate, the Pentacyclic Triterpenoid from <i>Tabernaemontana longipes</i>, is an Antitrypanosomal Agent
T2  - MOLECULES
AB  - The Latin American plant Tabernaemontana longipes was studied in this work as a potential source of antiparasitic agents. The chloroform extract of T. longipes leaves was separated into several fractions, and tested for antitrypanosomal activity. One of the fractions displayed significant growth inhibitory activity against Trypanosoma brucei. The active principle in the fraction was isolated, purified, and characterized by NMR and mass spectrometry. The antitrypanosomal agent in the CHCl3 extract of T. longipes leaves is the pentacyclic triterpenoid bauerenol acetate. A metabolite profiling assay suggest that the triterpenoid influences cholesterol metabolism. The molecular target(s) of bauerenol and its acetate, like many other antiparasitic pentacyclic triterpenoids is/are unknown, but they present privileged structural scaffolds that can be explored for structure-based activity optimization studies using phenotypic assays.

TI  - Phenology and reproductive biology of two species of <i>Byrsonima</i> Rich. (Malpighiaceae) in Cerrado area in Northeastern Brazil
T2  - BIOTA NEOTROPICA
AB  - The knowledge of the phenology patterns and of the floral biology, the determination of the role of the vectors of pollen flow, besides the understanding of the reproductive system, are fundamental points for the understanding of the reproductive biology of the species. The pollination ecology, reproductive system, flowering phenology and floral visitors of Byrsonima utnbellata Mart. and B. rotunda Griseb. were studied in a Cerrado area, at Urbano Santos municipality, Maranhao State. B. umbellata presented extended flowering period (eight months) and B. rotunda showed brief flowering period (one month). The species had hermaphroditic flowers with diurnal anthesis. B. umbellata is facultatively self-incompatible, showing higher fruit production through cross-pollinators (46.6%), and B. rotunda is mainly self-compatible, with fruit production in all treatments, even through agamospermy (60%), although higher production was achieved in geitonogamy (90%). We observed 42 and 16 species of bees in B. umbellata and B. rotunda flowers, respectively. Centris aenea and C. (Trachina) sp.n. were considered the main pollinators of B. umbellata flowers and C. aenea of B. rotunda. Both Byrsonima species present important ecological function, representing important resources to several species of bees during flowering season deficit in the studied environment.

TI  - Reinstatement and phylogenetic allocation of the palm rust genus <i>Cerradoa</i> in the Pucciniaceae, and establishment of <i>Pseudocerradoa</i>, gen. nov.
T2  - MYCOLOGIA
AB  - The genus Cerradoa (type species Cerradoa palmaea) was established in 1978 by Hennen and Ono and named after the Brazilian Cerrado biome. The holotype collected in Planaltina, Federal District, Brazil, belonged to the first rust fungus reported on palms (Arecaceae). For decades, the status of Cerradoa as a distinct genus has been regarded as doubtful, representing a synonym of Edythea (Uropyxidaceae) starting with the second edition of the Illustrated Genera of Rust Fungi in 1983. Our molecular phylogenetic analyses, as well as our morphological investigations, allowed us to reject this synonymy, leading to the reinstatement of Cerradoa within the Pucciniaceae. Cerradoa, together with morphologically similar genera such as the newly established Pseudocerradoa with two species (Ps. paullula and Ps. rhaphidophorae) infecting araceous hosts, the fern rust Desmella, and also P. engleriana, could not be assigned to any of the seven identified major lineages within the Pucciniaceae. Edythea, instead of being maintained as a member of the Uropyxidaceae, was herein placed in Pucciniaceae, shown phylogenetically in close relationship to Cumminsiella mirabilissima, both infecting the Berberidaceae. Additionally, our extensive phylogenetic analyses add guidance for future taxonomic revisions in the highly polyphyletic genus Puccinia and other established taxa within the family Pucciniaceae.

TI  - The ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) and their parasites: effects of parasitic manipulations and host responses on ant behavioral ecology
T2  - MYRMECOLOGICAL NEWS
AB  - Ants can display modified behaviors that represent the extended phenotypes of genes expressed by parasites that infect them. In such cases, the modifications benefit the parasite. Alternatively, displayed behaviors can represent host responses to infection that benefit colony fitness. Though some enigmatic examples of behavioral manipulation have been reported, parasitism of ants and its effects on ant behavior and ecology are generally poorly understood. Here, we summarize some of the present-day literature on parasite-ant interactions. Our main focus is on interactions that change host behavior so drastically that infected ants play a seemingly different societal and, perhaps, ecological role. We highlight the parallels that can be found across parasite-ant symbioses that result in manipulated behaviors, such as summiting, phototaxis, substrate biting, and wandering. We also point out the many present knowledge gaps that could be filled by efforts ranging from novel parasite discovery, to more detailed behavioral observations and next-generation sequencing to start uncovering mechanisms.

AB  - Bromeliad phytotelmata: the first scientometric study Bromeliads are plants predominantly found in the Neotropical Region, with high diversity of species and wide distribution. Some representatives of this family have the ability to form phytotelma environments through the accumulation of water and organic matter, serving as substrate and food for a variety of organisms. Here, a scientometric analysis was carried out to show trends in scientific work on bromeliad phytotelmata and the importance of these microcosms for the maintenance of biodiversity. The papers were analyzed using the Thomson Reuters, Scopus and Scielo databases between the years 1970 and 2021. Information was sought on the years of publications, geographic regions, countries, article design (descriptive, predictive, experimental, review), focus (ecological, biological, molecular), and ecological level of study (organism, population, community and ecosystem). South America presented the highest number of works developed with the subject and also with researchers involved. Most studies presented predictive designs focusing on community ecology. Insecta, followed by Crustacea and Anura, were the most studied groups of organisms. The results contribute to a better understanding of biodiversity in bromeliad phytotelmata, pointing out gaps and trends in research directed at these natural microcosms.

TI  - An Integrative View of the Phyllosphere Mycobiome of Native Rubber Trees in the Brazilian Amazon
T2  - JOURNAL OF FUNGI
AB  - The rubber tree, Hevea brasiliensis, is a neotropical Amazonian species. Despite its high economic value and fungi associated with native individuals, in its original area in Brazil, it has been scarcely investigated and only using culture-dependent methods. Herein, we integrated in silico approaches with novel field/experimental approaches and a case study of shotgun metagenomics and small RNA metatranscriptomics of an adult individual. Scientific literature, host fungus, and DNA databases are biased to fungal taxa, and are mainly related to rubber tree diseases and in non-native ecosystems. Metabarcoding retrieved specific phyllospheric core fungal communities of all individuals, adults, plantlets, and leaves of the same plant, unravelling hierarchical structured core mycobiomes. Basidiomycotan yeast-like fungi that display the potential to produce antifungal compounds and a complex of non-invasive ectophytic parasites (Sooty Blotch and Flyspeck fungi) co-occurred in all samples, encompassing the strictest core mycobiome. The case study of the same adult tree (previously studied using culture-dependent approach) analyzed by amplicon, shotgun metagenomics, and small RNA transcriptomics revealed a high relative abundance of insect parasite-pathogens, anaerobic fungi and a high expression of Trichoderma (a fungal genus long reported as dominant in healthy wild rubber trees), respectively. Altogether, our study unravels new and intriguing information/hypotheses of the foliar mycobiome of native H. brasiliensis, which may also occur in other native Amazonian trees.

TI  - Serological and molecular techniques applied for identification of <i>Plasmodium</i> spp. in blood samples from nonhuman primates
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE PARASITOLOGIA VETERINARIA
AB  - The aim of this study was to identify Plasmodium spp. in blood samples from nonhuman primates (NHPs) in the state of Maranhao, using classical and alternative techniques for examination of human malaria. A total of 161 blood samples from NHPs were analyzed: 141 from captive animals at a Wildlife Screening Center (CETAS) and 20 from free-living animals in a private reserve. The techniques used were microscopy, rapid diagnostic test (RDT), Indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT) and molecular techniques (semi-nested PCR, quantitative real-time PCR and LAMP). Two serological methods (dot-ELISA and indirect ELISA) were also standardized with rhoptry protein-soluble antigen of P. falciparum and P. berghei. Trophozoite forms of Plasmodium sp. were identified on slides from five different animals. No samples were positive through RDT and LAMP. Four samples were seropositive for P. malariae through IFAT. The samples showed low reactivity to ELISA. Plasmodium sp. was detected in 34.16% (55/161) of the samples using qPCR based on the 18S rRNA gene. After sequencing, two samples showed 100% identityl to P. malariae, one showed 97% identity to Plasmodium sp. ZOOBH and one showed 99% identity to P. falciparum. PCR was shown to be the most sensitive technique for diagnosing Plasmodium in NHP samples.

TI  - Impact of the neonicotinoid acetamiprid on immature stages of the predator <i>Eriopis connexa</i> (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae)
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY
AB  - Eriopis connexa is a native coccinelid predator in the Neotropical Region. In Argentina it is commonly found associated to sucking pests in several crops and among them aphids and whiteflies. These pests are usually controlled with newly developed systemic insecticides, such as the neonicotinoids. However, the compatibility between selective pesticides and natural enemies is required before incorporating them in integrated pest management (IPM) packages. Within this frame, the objective of this study was to evaluate the side effect of various concentrations/doses of one commonly used neonicotinoid in vegetal crops, acetamiprid, on immature stages of E. connexa by dipping or topical exposure for eggs and larvae, respectively. Acetamiprid reduced egg hatching from 34 to 100 %. Moreover, the embryogenesis was disrupted by insecticide at early embryo stage at all tested concentrations. Second larval instar was more susceptible to acetamiprid than the fourth one and this susceptibility was positively related with the tested concentrations. On the other hand, the survival reduction at larval stage reached 100 % from 20 mg a.i./L (10 % of maximum field concentration). Besides, the reproduction of the females developed from topical bioassays on fourth instar larvae was strongly affected, with reduction in fecundity and fertility from 22 to 44 % and from 37 to 45 %, respectively. Overall the results showed a high toxicity of acetamiprid on immature stages of E. connexa, demonstrating that this broadly used insecticide could reduce biocontrol services provided by this predator and could also likely disturb IPM programs.

TI  - From genes to ecosystems: a synthesis of amphibian biodiversity research in Brazil
T2  - BIOTA NEOTROPICA
AB  - Here, we summarize examples of significant advances in amphibian research supported by the Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP), focusing on recent discoveries in the fields of community ecology, habitat change, infection diseases, and multipurpose DNA sequencing. We demonstrated that FAPESP has been fundamental not only by directly funding research projects and scholarships, but also through its science training policy, fostering international collaborations with world-class research institutions, improving and consolidating new lines of research that often depended on a synergetic combination of different knowledge and complex tools. We emphasized that future studies will continue to focus on basic questions, such as description of new species, as well as taxonomic and systematic corrections. Furthermore, we also expect that there will be a strong integration among different disciplines using novel bioinformatics tools and modeling approaches, such as machine learning. These new approaches will be critical to further develop our understanding of foundational questions of amphibian life-history trait variation, disease transmission, community assembly, biogeography, and population forecasts under different global change scenarios such as agricultural expansion, agrochemical use, habitat loss, and climate change.

TI  - Biosynthesized Gold Nanoparticles Integrated Ointment Base for Repellent Activity Against <i>Aedes aegypti</i> L
T2  - NEOTROPICAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - The present study focused on preparing a nano-ointment base integrated with biogenic gold nanoparticles from Artemisia vulgaris L. leaf extract. As prepared, nano-ointment was characterized by using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and the morphology of the nano-ointment was confirmed through a scanning electron microscope. Initially, the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide results showed nano-ointment cytocompatibility at different concentrations (20-200 mu g/mL) against L929 cells. The in vitro hemolysis assay also revealed that the nano-ointment is biocompatible. Further studies confirmed that nano-ointment has repellent activity with various concentrations (12.5, 25, 50, 75, and 100 ppm). At 100 ppm concentration, the highest repellent activity was observed at 60-min protection time against the Aedes aegypti L. female mosquitoes. The results indicated that the increasing concentration of nano-ointment prolongs the protection time. Moreover, the outcome of this study provides an alternative nano-ointment to synthetic repellent and insecticides after successful clinical trials. It could be an eco-friendly, safer nano-bio repellent, which can protect from dengue fever mosquitoes.

TI  - Repellent Screening of Selected Plant Essential Oils Against Dengue Fever Mosquitoes Using Behavior Bioassays
T2  - NEOTROPICAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - Among the efforts to reduce mosquito-transmitted diseases, such as malaria and dengue fever, essential oils (EOs) have become increasingly popular as natural replacements for the repellant DEET. In this study, seven commercially available plant EOs against Aedes species mosquitoes were evaluated for their complete protection time (CPT, min) in vivo using human-hand in cage tests (GB2009/China and WHO2009). Among the EOs with the highest efficacy in repelling mosquitoes, Aedes albopictus (Skuse) were clove bud oil and patchouli oil. Both were further assessed according to the in vivo method recommended by the WHO, to determine their minimum effective dose and CPT. A comparison of the ED50 values (dose yielding a 50% repellent response) of these two EOs against Aedes aegypti(L.) showed that the ED50 (2.496 mu g/cm(2)) of patchouli oil was 1248 times higher than that of clove bud oil (0.002 mu g/cm(2)), thus demonstrating them greater efficacy of the latter in repelling Ae. aegypti mosquitoes. For the 2 EOs, eugenol was the major component with higher than 80% in relative amount of the clove bud oil. The patchouli oil had more than 30% of character chemical patchouli alcohol along with alpha-bulnesene (10.962%), alpha-guaiene (9.227%), and seychellene (7.566%). Clove bud oil was found to confer longer complete protection than patchouli oil against a common species of mosquito. These results suggest use of EOs as safe, highly potent repellents for use in daily life and against mosquito-transmitted diseases, such as malaria and dengue fever.

TI  - Intestinal parasites of endangered orangutans (<i>Pongo pygmaeus</i>) in Central and East Kalimantan, Borneo, Indonesia
T2  - PARASITOLOGY
AB  - Faecal samples from 163 captive and semi-captive individuals, 61 samples from wild individuals and 38 samples from captive groups of Bornean orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus) in Kalimantan, Indonesia, were collected during one rainy season (November 2003-May 2006) and screened for intestinal parasites using sodium acetate-acetic acid-formalin-concentration (SAFC), sedimentation, flotation, McMaster- and Baermann techniques. We aimed to identify factors influencing infection risk for specific intestinal parasites in wild orangutans and individuals living in captivity. Various genera of Protozoa (including Entamoeba, Endolimax, Iodamoeba, Balantidium, Giardia and Blastocystis), nematodes (Such as Strongyloides, Trichuris, Ascaris, Enterobius, Trichostrongylus and hookworms) and one trematode (a dicrocoeliid) were identified. For the first time, the cestode Hymenolepis was detected in orangutans. Highest prevalences were found for Strongyloides (individuals 37%; groups 58%), hookworms (41%; 58%), Balantidium (40%; 61%), Entamoeba coli (29%; 53%) and a trichostrongylid (13%; 32%). In re-introduction centres, infants were at higher risk of infection with Strongyloides than adults. Infection risk for hookworms was significantly higher in wild males compared with females. In groups, the centres themselves had a significant influence on the infection risk for Balantidium. Ranging patterns of wild orangutans, overcrowding in captivity and a shift of age composition in favour of immatures seemed to be the most likely factors leading to these results.

TI  - Ultrasonic songs and stridulum anatomy of <i>Asiophlugis</i> crystal predatory katydids (Tettigonioidea: Meconematinae: Phlugidini)
T2  - BIOACOUSTICS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SOUND AND ITS RECORDING
AB  - The behavioural ecology of ultrasonic-singing katydids is not well understood, and the general bioacoustics, barely known for a few Neotropical Meconematinae, tends to be overlooked for species from Southeast Asia. These include Asiatic species of Phlugidini, commonly known as crystal predatory katydids. One of its genera, Asiophlugis consists of 16 species for which acoustic signals and stridulum anatomy are broadly unknown. These characters can be used to understand species boundaries. Here, we sampled Asiophlugis from five sites in Malay Peninsula and Borneo Island, recorded the acoustic signals of five species plus one subspecies using ultrasound sensitive equipment, and examined their stridulum anatomy. The calling songs of the taxa involved were documented for the first time. We found that the stridulum anatomy (e.g., tooth distributions, tooth length and tooth density) is distinct between species but less so between subspecies. In contrary, songs of different taxa are different based on acoustic parameters (e.g., pulse duration, peak frequency) and descriptive patterns, even between the subspecies. We also did not observe that song signals are more different in sympatry than in allopatry. Whether this can be generalised requires further sampling, highlighting the need for more research on the ultrasonic acoustic communication in Asiatic katydids.

TI  - Genetic structure and phenotypic variation of <i>Anopheles darlingi</i> in northwest Colombia
T2  - INFECTION GENETICS AND EVOLUTION
AB  - This study evaluated the influence of environmental heterogeneity on Anopheles darlingi genetic and morphometric traits at a microgeographic level. Specimens of An. darlingi collected from multiple municipalities in the Colombian malaria endemic region Uraba-Bajo Cauca and Alto Sinu (UCS) were analyzed using 13 microsatellite loci. Spatial genetic structure, population variation and wing geometric morphometric analyses were performed. Microsatellite results showed low genetic differentiation and high gene flow among populations; four highly admixed subpopulations were detected with no particular association to the municipalities. Wing geometric morphometrics analysis showed a subtle but significant difference in wing shape for El Bagre vs. Mutat populations, possibly influenced by geographical distance. Discrimination among populations in the morphospace showed a slight separation of the Tierralta population. There was no significant correlation between the genetic and geographic or genetic and environmental distances. We hypothesize that environmental heterogeneity in the UCS region does not reach a threshold to affect population structure of An. darlingi. Another possibility is that microsatellites are not sensitive enough to detect existing structure. It remains to be determined which local factors govern phenotypic variation among these populations and how, or whether these may affect mosquito biology and transmission capacity.

TI  - Molecular data reveals California as the potential source of an invasive leafhopper species, <i>Macrosteles</i> sp nr. <i>severini</i>, transmitting the aster yellows phytoplasma in Hawaii
T2  - ANNALS OF APPLIED BIOLOGY
AB  - A species of aster leafhopper (Macrosteles sp.) became established in 2001 on Oahu, Hawaii, and through the transmission of the aster yellows phytoplasma, caused devastating losses to the island's watercress industry. DNA sequence data were analysed from two mitochondrial genes [cytochrome oxidase subunit 1(CO1) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide 1 (NADH1)] and one nuclear gene (wingless, Wg) (combined total of 1874 bp) to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships between putative US mainland source populations of aster leafhoppers and those introduced to Hawaii. These data were applied to elucidate the origin(s) and identity of Hawaiian infestations and the amount of genetic diversity within introduced invasive populations. Both phylogenetic search criteria (Bayesian and maximum likelihood models) converged onto similar tree topologies for all three gene regions and suggested that Hawaii infestations represent a single undescribed leafhopper species unrelated to the common aster leafhopper, Macrosteles quadrilineatus. An exact haplotype match was found from a specimen intercepted from watercress shipped to Hawaii from Los Angeles, California, suggesting this region as the potential source for Hawaiian infestations. Two mitochondrial haplotypes were identified in Hawaii suggesting two or perhaps just a single introduction of more than one female.

TI  - The potential of stable carbon isotope ratios and leaf temperature as proxies for drought stress in banana under field conditions
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
AB  - Drought stress is a major limiting factor for banana production and the incidence of drought spells is expected to increase with climate change. Climate smart practices and varieties are needed, but evaluation in the field is hampered by a lack of reliable physiological drought stress indicators. We investigated the potential of using stable carbon isotope ratios (813C) and leaf temperature and its derived DANS (Degrees above Non-Stressed Canopy) index as proxies for drought stress in banana. Leaf samples were taken for 813C analysis and leaf temperature was monitored throughout the day in a field trial with different banana plant stages (mother and daughter plants) under two irrigation treatments (rainfed and irrigated) during the dry season in Arusha, Tanzania. We found that 813C, leaf temperature and DANS were highly sensitive proxies for drought stress in banana. Soil volumetric water content had a significant effect on both 813C values and DANS. There was a significant difference in 813C (1.5 +/- 0.1%o, p < 0.01) and afternoon leaf temperature (7 +/- 1 <degrees>C, p < 0.01) between the rainfed and irrigated treatment. To deal with variability in 813C within the leaf, we developed a banana tailored sampling method. This study also revealed the complexity of carbon isotope dynamics in the intertwined system of mother and daughter plants. Daughter plants had more negative 813C values (-1.9 +/- 0.1%o, p < 0.01) and lower temperatures (4 +/- 1 degrees C) than mother plants. This indicates less stress, but interpretation of the 813C ratio is complicated by the potential carbon flux from mother to daughter plant. Once we have a full understanding of these complexities within the plant, the 813C and leaf temperature based methods we developed, can be directly implemented for both mother and daughter plants under various field conditions.

TI  - Current and emerging applications of saccharide-modified chitosan: a critical review
T2  - BIOTECHNOLOGY ADVANCES
AB  - Chitin, as the main component of the exoskeleton of Arthropoda, is a highly available natural polymer that can be processed into various value-added products. Its most important derivative, i.e., chitosan, comprising 8-1,4 -linked 2-amino-2-deoxy-8-d-glucose (deacetylated d-glucosamine) and N-acetyl-d-glucosamine units, can be prepared via alkaline deacetylation process. Chitosan has been used as a biodegradable, biocompatible, non -antigenic, and nontoxic polymer in some in-vitro applications, but the recently found potentials of chitosan for in-vivo applications based on its biological activities, especially antimicrobial, antioxidant, and anticancer ac-tivities, have upgraded the chitosan roles in biomaterials. Chitosan approval, generally recognized as a safe compound by the United States Food and Drug Administration, has attracted much attention toward its possible applications in diverse fields, especially biomedicine and agriculture. Despite some favorable characteristics, the chitosan's structure should be customized for advanced applications, especially due to its drawbacks, such as low drug-load capacity, low solubility, high viscosity, lack of elastic properties, and pH sensitivity. In this context, derivatization with relatively inexpensive and highly available mono-and di-saccharides to soluble branched chitosan has been considered a "game changer". This review critically scrutinizes the emerging technologies based on the synthesis and application of lactose-and galactose-modified chitosan as two important chitosan derivatives. Some characteristics of chitosan derivatives and biological activities have been detailed first to understand the value of these natural polymers. Second, the saccharide modification of chitosan has been dis-cussed briefly. Finally, the applications of lactose-and galactose-modified chitosan have been scrutinized and compared to native chitosan to provide an insight into the current state-of-the research for stimulating new ideas with the potential of filling research gaps.

TI  - Conserving migratory land birds in the New World: Do we know enough?
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
AB  - Migratory bird needs must be met during four phases of the year: breeding season, fall migration, wintering, and spring migration; thus, management may be needed during all four phases. The bulk of research and management has focused on the breeding season, although several issues remain unsettled, including the spatial extent of habitat influences on fitness and the importance of habitat on the breeding grounds used after breeding. Although detailed investigations have shed light on the ecology and population dynamics of a few avian species, knowledge is sketchy for most species. Replication of comprehensive studies is needed for multiple species across a range of areas.
   Information deficiencies are even greater during the wintering season, when birds require sites that provide security and food resources needed for survival and developing nutrient reserves for spring migration and, possibly, reproduction. Research is needed on many species simply to identify geographic distributions, wintering sites, habitat use, and basic ecology. Studies are complicated, however, by the mobility of birds and by sexual segregation during winter. Stable-isotope methodology has offered an opportunity to identify linkages between breeding and wintering sites, which facilitates understanding the complete annual cycle of birds.
   The twice-annual migrations are the poorest-understood events in a bird's life. Migration has always been a risky undertaking, with such anthropogenic features as tall buildings, towers, and wind generators adding to the risk. Species such as woodland specialists migrating through eastern North America have numerous options for pausing during migration to replenish nutrients, but some species depend on limited stopover locations. Research needs for migration include identifying pathways and timetables of migration, quality and distribution of habitats, threats posed by towers and other tall structures, and any bottlenecks for migration.
   Issues such as human population growth, acid deposition, climate change, and exotic diseases arc global concerns with uncertain consequences to migratory birds and even less-certain remedies. Despite enormous gaps in our understanding of these birds, research, much of it occurring in the past 30 years, has provided sufficient information to make intelligent conservation efforts but needs to expand to handle future challenges.

TI  - Activity Against <i>Musca domestica</i> of Hypocrealean Fungi Isolated from Culicids in Central Brazil and Formulated in Vermiculite
T2  - NEOTROPICAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - Musca domestica L. is a cosmopolitan nuisance of high sanitary importance. Entomopathogenic fungi are innovative and attractive tools for integrated control of the housefly to overcome insufficient levels of control caused by increasing resistance of this pest against chemical insecticides. High virulence of a fungal strain is a prerequisite to develop a mycoinsecticide, and the present study investigated the potential of hypocrealean fungi from the genera Beauveria, Clonostachys, Cordyceps, Akanthomyces, Metarhizium, and Tolypocladium, isolated from mosquitoes in Central Brazil against M. domestica. The highest mortalities (larvae, pupae, and adults) were caused by Metarhizium humberi IP 478 (98%) and IP 421 (90%), Metarhizium anisopliae IP 432 (85%), Beauveria bassiana IP 433 (82%), and Tolypocladium cylindrosporum IP 425 (68%) after a 23-day exposure of initially pre-pupating third instar larvae to conidia mixed with vermiculite. Lethal concentrations to kill 90% of adults of IP 433 and IP 478 were 5 x 10(7) and 10(8) conidia g(-1) substrate, respectively. Fifty percent of adults were killed within 4 to 5 days of exposure initially as pupae close to emergence to substrate treated with conidia of IP 478 or IP 433 at 1.1 x 10(8) conidia g(-1), respectively. The other fungal strains tested were less virulent. The results demonstrate high potentials for conidial preparations in vermiculite of IP 433 and IP 478 as candidates for the biological control of both pre-pupating larvae, pupae, and emerging adults of houseflies.
